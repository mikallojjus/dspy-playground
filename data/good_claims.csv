"Joe Rogan podcast. Check out

The Joe Rogan experience

Train by Day. Joe Rogan podcast by night all day,

Gentlemen. How are you, sir? Good to

See you. Joe Rogan. Yeah.

Good to see you.

Nice to see you, man. Your

Movie's great.

Thank you very much.

When does it come out

In the United States? It comes out November 7th. Okay. And then various dates over the next month and a half or so around the rest of the world.

It's a fucking heavy movie, man. Yeah. It's a heavy movie. Yeah. The, the trial, that footage, was that all real footage? The Holocaust footage? Yeah. Real footage of the, the

Plow. That was one of the, one of the reasons that that inspired Jamie to go ahead. That he was given access to that footage, some of which has never been seen since 1946. Oh. You know, it's a very interesting way that he makes the subject matter accessible because it's such a dry topic from the outside. Right. Here's a court case. Right. You know, he's yet another courtroom drama. Right. Procedural or whatever. So I can imagine that people would see that and go, well, that's, you know, might not be an exciting watch or something, but he sort of puts the audience in this position where he allows them to start to be amused by some of the things that are going on and the interpersonal relationships. And, you know, when the commandant of the prison has to call up his two top mental health experts and dress them down for getting into a fist fire, you know, things like that kind of, it, it's, there's a charm to it. And then he gets you into the courtroom and he locks the door. Mm. And he goes, now you're gonna see what we're talking about. So I think it's a very interesting film device to disarm people before he starts giving them the, the real juice, you know?

Yeah. It's, it's also a fascinating psychological tape from the psychiatrist, from Kelly's perspective, you know, because the way he's describing all human beings, that all human beings are capable of these horrific acts. Yeah.

And that's the thing that was a very unpopular take at the time, actually led to his removal from the process, because he wasn't fulfilling what the war department wanted him to say. Yeah. Which is, you know, all Nazis are crazy, you know, ruled by a mad man, and this is a unique experience, but that's not what he found. In sitting down talking to the 22 major Nazi sort of names that, that he was assigned to post-war, he realized that every single one of these people was, you know, as normal. Well, there was a couple that were pretty out there, but, you know, for the most part, he was dealing with rational men.

Yeah. That's what's scary. And

How the hell did they end up making this series of decisions if they're rational men? Well,

It just seems like things just get pushed slowly but surely into this unbelievably horrific place. Right. Like, it starts off, there's just, it's just a war. It starts off Hitler's in power, and then slowly but surely things get pushed incrementally. Yes.

And that's the thing that's, you know, difficult because gigantic jumps we can all read. Right. But little incremental changes. Right.

The boiling of the frog,

Just how, you know, you take away this person's rights, that person's personal power, you know, and slowly, you know, you get to a point where the average person then turns around and goes, how did we get to here? Right. You know, I thought it was, I thought it was about something else. You know, there's a smoke screen going up and I thought we were doing that, and as it turns out, it's very different.

Yeah. That's the one of the scariest aspects of human beings is our ability to dehumanize others, to turn others into something less than us non-human and other humans with families, with mothers and fathers and children. It's

One of the most dangerous things. I, I see it going on everywhere at the moment that we're trying to say that you're either, you know, and for one or of a better teen name that you're either red or that you're blue. Right. And humans are far more nuanced than that. They're not, we're not that extreme, you know? And that the idea that you can split all of us into two camps, it's kind of nuts.

It's nuts, you know? Yeah. It's

Nuts. And it takes out all the room for subtlety in a discussion, and therefore it makes communicating with each other less and less available. Well,

It's just, in this country in particular, I don't know about Australian politics, but we only have two parties, and they're both essentially financed by enormous corporations. So it's a, it's a ruse. The whole thing's a ruse. Right. And you have different social issues on each side that come up and, and then it becomes this year with us or against us. Right. Versus left. But it's, there's,

It's going nowhere good.

Nowhere good. Yeah.

Yeah. We have the same sort of, you know, two principle party system in Australia as well. But we have a slight advantage in that we are kind of on the edge of the world in a lot of ways, you know, so what I've always said is, when you're growing up in Australia and New Zealand, you're growing, you grow up looking out. Yes. You understand your own culture and all that, but you grow up looking out what else is happening in the rest of the world. What, what's happening in Europe, what's happening in America, you know, but by and large Americans grow up looking in,

Right.

The principal sports are only played by American teams, American football, baseball in some instances, baseball. But they're not the types of sports that we play. Where the pinnacle of that sport is international competition. Right. Rugby union. Right. Rugby league, cricket. Right. Football, soccer, you know, so we, we grow at, with that as being the pinnacle of any particular sport if you get to represent your country. And that's only really relevant in an American sense for in an Olympic period, you know? Right.

That's it. Yeah. We never think about other sports. We mock them. We think about, you know, like, what are you doing playing cricket? You know?

And it's a fascinating game. It's any, anybody who loves baseball generally, I've found baseball lovers are all about the minutiae. They're all about the stats and what those stats mean. You know, there might be a certain score on the board, but, you know, their, and their team might be getting beaten, but they see in the stats that there's, you know, a certain dominance in an area. And so they, you know, they still have a hope that the outcome of the game is, is may come their way. And cricket fans are, are the same as that. So the, the fact that the two never seem to meet is odd to me. It is odd. 'cause it's the same type of game.

This is, cricket is larger worldwide. Right? Much larger.

Yeah. Well you have the India. India and Pakistan. Yeah. And Sri Lanka and you know, countries like that with huge populations playing the game.

Did you, do you guys have home runs in cricket, like where someone really cracks the ball and smashes outta the park? It's,

It's called a six. If you hit the ball over the fence without a bouncing, you get six runs. Oh, okay. And so that's, that's the run. Does that happen often in, see there's different forms of the game. You have T 20, then you have one day. So this is gonna be, this is gonna be difficult. T 20 means that each team gets to bowl 20 overs. An over is six balls. So you have 26 ball overs that you're bowling to the batting team. And they've gotta get, try and get as many runs as they can. Okay. And then you'll have a go at batting, right? So you have that version of the game, which is very short. It can be, it can happen in an evening. Then you have a one day game, which maybe, you know, starts in the afternoon, finishes by eight or nine at night. But then you have the test match. And this is what I grew up with it. It's sort of been dialed down a little bit now 'cause they brought in shorter forms of the game. But the test match is between two countries and it's played over five days. And the idea is that both teams have to bat and bowl twice. And the result will be whatever it is at the end of five days.

Days, five days, man, five full days. And they start, and then they have morning tea, and then they have another break. They have lunch and then they have afternoon tea. And if it's really hot, every now and then somebody will walk out and give them drinks. You know, it's very civilized. My cousin Martin was a great cricket player. He was the captain of New Zealand. My other cousin Jeffrey was also a captain of New Zealand. So I kind of grew up in a cricketing family. And it was one of the pathways for me. There was, you know, potentially play cricket, you know. But when you've got two of your cousins who are as good as they were, it's a very crowded room. You know, s like, well how am I gonna make any kind of statement here? When one of the Martin, at his peak, he was called by Sports Illustrated, I believe the Michael Jordan of world Cricket. Wow. He was a very dominant player in his day. And he used to call, we used to discuss test matches as the gentleman's war. 'cause you have a defined space, you have X amount of players and you've gotta stop that little ball in this gigantic 180 meter by 120 meter oval. You've gotta stop that little red ball from going between the players and therefore, you know, preventing the batsman from scoring runs. But that five day game, the way that it ebbs and flows, once you're into it, it's the only way you wanna watch cricket. 'cause it's like, you know, at one moment your team can be just so far ahead. You're like, Ugh. Just, you know, and then it'll turn on a dime and day two things get really dark for your team. You know, day three, you got an edge back again, day four. It's fantastic, man. And as a kid I used to go and attend every day of a five day game. Wow. Yeah. It was crazy.

Yeah, there's nothing like that here.

No, no. I mean, I mean, it really requires, I mean, just like, look at the, you know, five, five day game, it's like five news cycles, right? Yeah. We're not really set up for that sort of patience. And

How is it broadcast? Is it stream television? Television? Yeah, yeah,

Yeah. Yeah. I mean, you know, there's cables and companies and stuff have got involved now, but it used to be national network. And when cricket season was on, I mean, you know, back in the day people would come from overseas and into Australia and the summer and, and ask the question, is there anything else on television except sport.

Is it, so when, when you're, do they take commercial breaks? Yep. Okay. They do. So that's the problem with soccer, right? Soccer in America, the reason why it's very hard to sell is not just that a lot of people don't play it right, but it's says there's no commercial breaks. Right.

They just keep going. You have a huge number of people who play association football, soccer in this country. Oh,

For sure. Listen, they have a, a professional team here. I've been to the game, but it's nowhere near the involvement that football has

American football, American football in this country. Yeah, for

Sure. Not even close. Yeah.

Well see, all of our sports that we like in Australia, apart from cricket, tend to be quite compact. You know, 80 minute game, 90 minute game, 10 minute halftime, and it's part of your day. It's not your whole day. Right. It's like, we'll go to a football game and then we'll go and, you know, have dinner or go and do something else. So we have that same thing where the action is so continuous that the idea of stopping for a commercial break quite gets quite tricky.

Yeah, that makes sense. It's always been fascinating to me that rugby never took off in America. Yeah. Because it seems like kind of a more savage version of football. Yeah.

Well the, the way I think it sort of plays out is you've got rugby union, right? Which is 15 men aside. Every time a player is tackled, you re-compete for the ball. You have rocks, mos, you have line outs. It's a very different game. But there's another version of rugby called Rugby League, which was played in the north of England. And that has a defined period of offense and defense. And I think that's where American football comes from. I actually own a team in Australia in the NRL, the National Rugby League, the South Sydney rabbits, the oldest team in the game, 1908, we were formed, bought the team in 2006. And it's very easy to explain to Americans, have American friends come down. I spend maybe 20 minutes talking to them and they get the game and they start to dig it. My girlfriend at the moment, actually Brittany, was one of the reasons why I really started being attracted to her because she understood the game straight away, you know? And then I find out that when she was younger, she was a cheerleader for the New Orleans Saints.

Oh,

Wow. While she was studying electrical engineering. So it, yeah, it, it's a very similar, rugby league is a very easy game for Americans to follow. Now, how it's refereed becomes frustrating where an American audience, because it's, there's so much room for interpretation, referee to referee game to game situation to situation. So it can get frustrating. I think one of the greatest things about American football from the outside, or from an objective point of view, it seems that every single thing that the, the NFL try to do is based on and across the board fairness for everyone. Mm. You know, so those, you know, the conversations were between the referees and what have you seemed to be, everybody's on the same page. And sometimes when you're watching rugby league, something that you saw somebody else get sent from the field for the week before, and now nothing happens this week, but it's the same kind of hit or whatever. I was like, what? You know, so I, I've had a few Americans get corrupt, very frustrated. Is that corruption? No, I think that's, yeah. I think it, the game moves very fast. Right. And, you know, referees don't have eyes on all sides of their head, you know?","[

"I won't even guess, but I think Clapton was living in New York or London or somewhere. And he had a, he had a, a party at his house and it, 'cause he just had that record come out and it would gone number one. And he had it stuck on his fridge with a magnet. You know, like the charts with a circle around it, you know, I shot the sheriff number one, Eric Clapton and Bob Marley was at the party and apparently he found a pen and he wrote onto Clapton's fridge. No, Eric, I shot the sheriff Bob,

I shot him first Bitch.

That's

Hilarious. But that uncut gems film is it, is it, it it, it is a perfect movie in regards to like the way it treats a degenerate gambler. He's a jewelry broker, jewelry salesman. And he's just out of his fucking mind. It's always sports, it's always this, it's, there's, there's always a game that's going on and he's betting this and it, you get so much anxiety watching the movie like, oh God, don't do that. Right. Don't do that. Don't. Oh Jesus, what are you doing? It's like the whole movie. My palms are sweating. I'm moving around in my chair because I as a kid grew up in pool halls, like from the time not grew up in pool halls, but I spent so much time between age 23 and you know, into my thirties. I was in pool halls all the time. Right. And I played a lot of pool and I was around a lot of addicted campers. And I never got it, it never hit me. But I was always just fascinated by the grip that it had on people. It was like they would, their eyes would be going back and forth. Their fucking skin would be pale. It gripped them like a drug. It gripped them like crystal meth.

I, I really dislike the way in Australia we have normalized it. You know, they're doing a sports report on the news, the national news. And they'll tell you the odds. The odds.

Well we do that with the UFC. The UFC. We give the odds they, they even, I don't know if they announce round by round odds, but the, I think they do, but the, I don't, I try to pay attention to it 'cause I don't vote. I, excuse me, I don't gamble on the UFC but I used to, so I used to gamble on the UFC when I first started working for them. And then I was like, I don't think I should do this anymore. No, probably not. This is a long time ago though. So what I started doing is giving my friend Aubrey, who's my business partner at on it. I started giving him tips and he was like 84%. Right? 'cause I know the sport. And a lot of these guys would be coming from Japan or coming from Russia. And I'd be like, oh, this guy on from Brazil, Anderson Silva bet the fucking house. Right? I go bet the fucking house. 'cause people do

Not my house though, your

House, not my house. But there's people that were coming across from other organizations that I was a giant fan of and the bookmakers were woefully uneducated about, especially foreign fighters. Right. And there's a thing like if you are gambling on MMA and you don't know how to fight, you're just guessing. You don't really, we're all just guessing when two guys get into the cage together. But you're really guessing. Like you really don't, you can't recognize like how fast a person is. You can't recognize how good they're at countering. You just know stats. Right. You know, but you don't know how to do it. And if you don't know how to do it, you can't really see it. You don't really know. So at A certain point in time I stopped just on my own gambling 'cause I like, I don't, 'cause I was, people were accusing me of being biased one way or the other anyway. Right. Which maybe I was, you know, I got better at that. But I wanted to make sure that no one thought that. So I was like, I'm only gambling. I'm a couple hundred bucks or something like that. I wasn't doing anything crazy. Right. But the, the fucking people that I have friends, like good friends that are just hooked and when they start talking about like fights that they're gambling on or they put so much money on this and money on that, I'm like, oh my god guy. I know guys that put millions of dollars on a fight. I'm like, oh my god. Yeah. You're freaking me out. You're fucking freaking me out man. I don't care how wealthy you are. If you put a $3 million bet on a fight and you lose, like you're not gonna sleep for a week,

Man. I just wouldn't be able to wake up with myself the next day.

And then if win, I would

Feel so foolish.

If you win, it might be even worse. 'cause now you're gonna keep doing it.

Now you get that, you get the sting. Yeah. The thing is with, with what we do in Australia, like the newspapers, like you know, network news services, we allow betting ads. It is so all prevailing. You know, I had an experience probably a year or two ago and I see my two boys are talking to a mate of theirs and they've all got their phones out And I realized they were checking up on their bets. You know, so I had to have a big conversation with my boys and say, look, every single dollar that you have comes outta my pocket. If I give you a dollar, that's not a dollar to gamble with. I had to have very serious conversation with 'em about, it's like, I don't care if you think it's fun, you know, I don't care. You've gotta actually see it for what it is. Yeah. Because what's five or $10 now is easily gonna turn into four or $500 in a minute. A thousand dollars. You know, sooner or later you will allow yourself to think that this thing is, you know, beyond fun and it's a way for you to earn back your losses or whatever. Right. So I just had a, had to have a, a chat with 'em and they were probably looking at me going, how old is our father that he doesn't understand that everybody does this? You know? But I just had to let 'em know from my point of view, I didn't appreciate them taking my hard earned dollars and wasting them.

I get it. But I also like that it exists because I want the ability, like if I wasn't working for the UFC and I could go to the fights and gamble on the fights, I would definitely do it because it a knowledge, it wasn't to

Me. Right.

This episode is brought to you by Uber Eats every football season, the same thing happens. The game somehow makes everyone really hungry. Quarterback scrambles, clearly assigned it's time for breakfast burritos, turnovers suddenly dessert at 2:00 PM doesn't sound so crazy. And wing formations.

Even last minute grocery runs, you'll find savings on all your favorites delivered straight to your door. Order Now on Uber Eats,

I don't need it. If I'm into the sport. Yeah. I want to see the game, you know, I, I care about Oh yeah. What happens in the game. I

Get it.

Possibly because from the owner point of view, I don't, I wouldn't want any extra pressure. Of course. So I, I don't understand why here's, here's this game. It's like two teams of pristine athletes who have busted their nuts to get in this situation. And the competition, the physical competition between these two teams isn't enough. You gotta put something else on the line, you know? Well it just adds,

It adds for some people,

For some people. Yeah. Yeah.

They get that extra juice out of the knowing that, the thing is also as a commentator, I am as unbiased as humanly possible. And it's a hard thing when friends fight. 'cause there's some guys that fight that are my good friends and I'm, I'm like, I just hope they don't get hurt and I want 'em to win. But I have to be excited about the other guy winning, which is kind of crazy. The other guy's beating up your friend. Right, right. And you have to be excited about it. So it's good that I don't have any money riding on fights 'cause I don't have, I'm not happy if one person wins or loses. Right. My my idea is we're gonna see who's the better athlete, who's the better fighter. And I can handle gambling. I've never had a gambling problem because I'm, I'm not a risk averse person. Obviously I like risks, but I'm also, I'm, I'm safe. Like I know what I'm doing even though I do dangerous things.

You've had a look at it first. Yeah. You've examined, but

You do

Have, you have that ability and inclination for examination. So

You have to have that. And I feel like that's the case with alcohol. That's the case with cigarettes. I'm in favor of all those things being legal. But I know so many people that have a problem with alcohol, like cannot live without alcohol. I know so many people that can't quit smoking cigarettes. I feel like you should be able to do whatever you want to do. And I want, I want freedom. And that comes with gambling. And I, I think gambling freedom, like the ability to decide that you want to take a risk of something that should be available, but we should educate people as to like, what is actually going on in your mind that's allowing you to get captured by this thing. And now you're chasing bad money and you're in a downward spiral management. Like understanding, okay, this is a thrill, but this thrill could take over your whole life. Right. If you are maybe genetically susceptible, psychologically susceptible, like understand what it is. But I don't think we should take away cars that can go over 60 miles an hour because some people crash their cars and die. You know what I mean? Yeah. It's, I, I feel like I like that gambling exists and I always wish that it existed back in the day. I was like, it'd be fun that a hundred bucks on this or a hundred bucks on that, but I don't have the problem. Like I could see if I came from a family that was torn apart by gambling and you'd go, you know, you don't understand my dad lost our house. Like, okay, but that was a bad decision. Your, you know, your dad could have died drinking and driving and smashed into a tree. These are bad decisions. You don't have to make bad decisions just because something is tempting you. It's an interesting, it's an interesting debate because do you nanny state the whole world? Do you think gambling should be illegal? Do you think you should have to go to Vegas for it? That seems kind of crazy. I mean it's certainly not a black or white issue to me. There's a lot of gray area involved in it and I know there's a lot of people that push back on the idea of, of whether these gambling apps and all these different things should be legal and like

It's the normalization process that bothers me the most. Mm. That it's part of the new service with the apps that, that it's, but it's just put in front of you whether you're interested in it or not. You know, this team is playing that team and here's the odds. Right. And I just don't, I don't think it's healthy to have that as much of, you know, tho those stats as much a part of the actual news report as who's playing and what's on the line.

The thing about it though is it does lead you to have debate about like, here's a perfect example. Canelo Alvarez versus Terence Crawford. Terence Terence Crawford was going up two weight classes. In my mind though, he's so skillful. I gave him a chance. Right. I was like, I favor him to win. But I believe he was the underdog who was the, find out what the odds were for the Canelo Alvarez. Terence Crawford fight. I believe he was the underdog even though he was an undefeated multi division world champion. Like one of the greatest of all time for sure. But he was jumping up from the 154 pound weight class where he just won the belt. He was the 147 pound weight class all the way up to 1 68. That's a big leap. 14 pounds. And everybody thought canal's gonna have too much power. He is gonna be too big. I'm like, I don't think so. I don't think that's correct. It was odds. Is it same? Yeah. Crawford was underdog. Yeah, Crawford was the underdog. So not a huge underdog. Plus 1 35 versus plus one 40 somewhere around there. So it's not huge. Not even two to one. Not even one and a half to one. But enough where I was like, I think they're wrong. You know? So it's like, it, it fosters debate, you know, even if you're not gambling. And I didn't gamble on that fight, but I did. I was telling my friends, I got a long discussion with a good buddy of mine who's a, a real boxing connoisseur. He is like, Canelo's too big, he hits too hard. I'm like, that guy doesn't get hit. Much like, I don't think that's as big of a factor as we're thinking. I think it's a skill thing. They're not that different in size. I'm like, I don't think so. And so that odds thing is to me exciting. Like, it, it fosters debate. Like you get, you start talking about, you know, and if it's a game, you start talking about players. Like he chokes in the outfield, he does this, he does that. This guy's, he's always stealing bases. I'm factoring that in and you know, the odds become a part of the discussion. But yeah, it is ultimately the problem is, first of all, kids are addicted to apps as it is. They use them, they're always on their damn phone. And they'll go from TikTok to Instagram to to x to, you know, they're check this and then they'll check that and they'll check that and they'll check their Snapchat and then they'll check the gambling app. And then it's like, you're just addicted to this goddamn phone. So something on your phone that's also addicting. It's like addiction on top of addiction. 'cause you're already getting your little dopamine rush just by looking at your phone. And then if you're also getting a gambling rush on top of that. Yeah. We gotta educate people. Yeah. But I think we gotta educate people on social media addiction, which I think a, a giant percentage of our population is completely addicted to

Social media, probably including me. I spend large amount of every day scrolling through TikTok for some reason. And

What do you, what's your algorithm like? What kind of stuff are you getting?

I'm getting a lot of dating apps at the moment, which is really embarrassing because I'm, I'm not looking on any, I'm not on any dating apps, so I'm not sure that the algorithm is fully truthful. I think there's certain amount of things you just get fed. Right. You know, for

Especially like a dating app because that's a promotion, you know? Right. They're

Promoting that. Yeah. There's a lot. Seems to be a lot coming up. But that's the problem, isn't it? Because the way the algorithm shapes it, you know, pretty much everything that comes up on your phone you have some form of interest in. Right. So that keeps you looking at, at what you're looking at. Yeah. I've got to probably gotta dial it down a little bit, but I'll be in the bush in a minute. This has been such a crazy year, man. You know, so, you know, we finished Nuremberg last year and then I went on that big tour, which is when I was here, when I came to see you the first time. But this year since between December and August I made five movies. Wow. And I was on the set of the sixth and so weary and I had no juice. I, I still feel it a little bit actually, man, you know, I've had a little bit of time off, but I've still had so many responsibilities. I kind of feel like I broke my brain or something in August. Mm. And I'm still trying to recover and I won't really recover till I get home the next time. As I was saying to you before, is when I land at home now I won't know when I'm flying out again. And that is such a relief because when you do know, when you're flying out again every day is just counting down, counting down. You might have three weeks, but it doesn't feel like three weeks. Hmm. Because you 100% know when you're leaving again. But this time I'll get home and I'll have three months and I'll be in the bush and I'll be waking up with the birds and you know, hopefully all of those things that I emptied out through the, the earlier part of the year will, will fill up again.","[

"paralysis tick. And they realized, she realized that between her and this other girl that looks after the, the puppy and we're not there, they'd got their dates mixed up. And so it wasn't actually covered for flea and tick, you know, stuff in its bloodstream. Mm. So very dangerous. So they had to shave the dog completely and everything. And they, they pulled off another couple of ticks, but there was only just the one paralysis tick. So it's okay. But if you leave that, and if you don't deal with it, the dog's gonna be dead in a minute.

Paralysis

Tick. Yeah. Yeah. It gets into their, into their body. And, and it is, it, it affects them the way the name says on the box, the

Paralysis. There's one that's going on in America now called, called the Well, what it, what it gives you. It's, it's a lone star tick is what what gives you this bite. And this produces something called Alpha Gal. And it makes you allergic to red meat. What? Yeah. It's my friend, my good friend Evan Fer. Got it. And he, he was allergic to red meat for a good solid year. And then eventually it went away. And then it came back again Recently. It's, it's a huge pain in the ass. So

We, we have ticks in Australia, but we've never had to deal with Lyme disease like you have here. Mm. But in the last, you know, four or five decades, people started raising deer in Australia for, for meat and what have you. And a few of them get away. You know, there's, there's no deer farms around where I am, which is north of Sydney by 600 Ks. But recently a couple of the guys that worked for me on the farm said they've seen deer going through the bush at the back of my block. You know, so that means that there's some just animals that have escaped, and they're most likely to have been in the southern highlands, which is south of Sydney. And somehow they've got themselves all the way up to where, where I am. How

Many miles is that? Or kilometers?

Well, we're probably talking about 700 something kilometers.

They just wandered. Yeah.

Wow. And, and didn't get run over or didn't get, you know, that's crazy.

That's

Absolutely.

And they're probably bringing ticks,

Probably and the wrong tics.

Yeah. In America, they have a problem with That too. Deer farms and this disease called chronic wasting disease, and it's spread throughout, large swaths of America have a giant issue with this, where deer herds get infected. My friend Doug Duran, he has a, a farm out in Wisconsin and they, they've had a significant problem with it to the point where they've started issuing more tags and thinning the herd. They're trying to kill more deer to try to lessen this spread of this stuff. Right. 'cause chronic wasting disease, it get, it's a PreOn disease, so it's like, it, it gets on plants. It has, it stays on them for a long time. So, and they start drooling when they have it. And in that drool is more chronic wasting disease. Right. So another deal will come along and graze on the ground where they drool, then they get it. Horrible, horrible disease. And a lot of it emanated from these deer farms

When I first bought the farm, which was a hundred acres to start with, but it's now like 1700 and it's attached to a state forest as well. So I can get up behind my place and go for days. Oh wow. Which is just sort of like, you know, which is cool, but back in the day, we used to have platypus in the creeks. We had wombats, and now I see more foxes down. I see native animals, or I see an equivalent amount of foxes as I see wallabies

Are foxes invasive. Yeah. Yeah. Okay.

There you go. And they're absolute, you know? Yeah. Because they eat anything and everything. Yeah. I used to have a big family of what we call bush turkeys living behind the house, and they're still there, but they used to just proudly walk around, you know? And, and it was fun. You'd going through the bush and then suddenly there's a road full of bush turkeys. It's great, you know, but now the population is right down and they're totally ninja now. You know, you don't see them very often when you do, they're like very suspicious. They checking you out, you know, he's just being

Hunted 24 7.

It's foxes, man.

Yeah. You also have a, a large feral cat problem,

Right? Gigantic. Yeah, gigantic. The one and only cat that I let my mother have at the farm. This is way back man. I was training for Cinderella, man. And, you know, they sent me this group of boxes, Olympic guys and stuff like that. And every single one of 'em can smash the piss outta me in the ring. So I've gotta smash the piss outta 'em in other areas. So I train them until they drop, you know, getting them on bicycles and taking them to the bush, you know, and things like that. Just to sort of like, keep the balance, you know? Right. And this one particular day, and I had it in my mind that I was just gonna absolutely smash them. I was gonna get into this situation 'cause it's one road, you know? And I was just gonna get so far in front of them, psychologically damage them, you know what I mean?

So, and I, I just devious, yeah. Just

Had a conversation with my mom and she was like, oh darling, you know, I, you know, I'd really love to have a cat. And I'm like, mom, we lived in this privileged situation. We've got sulfur, crested, cockatoos roses, king parrots, all these beautiful birds. And the worst thing that we could do for them is put a cat into that. So you can't have a cat. You know, I'm riding through the bush, 25, 30 Ks in at this point, right. I'm getting to the top of this hill. I'm looking down, I'm seeing these boys struggling quite some distance, probably about a kilometer and a half away from me, you know? And I'm going, good, I'll just have a little rest here. And I just hear this little noise and I'm like, what the hell is that? So I just take three or four steps off the road. You know, probably about seven or eight minutes ago, I was coming around this corner and a car was there on the road, which is kind of unusual for the state forest in that particular area. Right? So I take these three or four steps in and there's a little kitten sitting in the bush, like, what the hell? So I pick it up, it's warm, you know, I can't leave it here. So I, I put it in my backpack, right? And I complete the ride. I get to the top of this hill where this t trig station is, and everybody's standing around and I go, oh, I found a cat. You know? So I bring it out, everyone's, all these big boxes go, ooh, you know, cute little kitten. So I took it home to my mom. I said, okay, here's your cat. You know, and the way that I reasoned it is like, this is me saying to my mother, you cannot have something that will make you happy. And then the universe goes, listen to your mother. So, you know, that cat hated human beings for the rest of its life, you know? Wow. The only person it got on with was my mum. And we used to have like four bells around his neck. So to give the birds enough warning so it didn't cause too much damage. So

Was a feral cat then,

I think? Or was

It tossed outta that car?

I think so, yeah.

Oh, it

Was too clean and too warm for it to have been living. But that's what people do. That's, they have a problem. They have a cat that has a litter. They dunno how to solve it. Pet stores don't want it. Their friends don't want it. So they come up with the concept of just chucking them into the bush.

Well, didn't it start out what they brought, they introduce cats to try to eliminate some other animal.

We have such a history of stupidity in that regard. Have you heard of the cane tote?

Yes. Yes.

It's just so fantastic. Right? Yeah. So, you know, they're growing sugar cane in Queensland and there's a particular flying creature that they want to control. So they start looking around. We always blame the British for this. 'cause it's usually, it's usually a naturalist, a British naturalist or scientist that comes up with the concept. And so they, they look through all the ahs, can't remember where they found it from, but they, they found this toad who seemed to have this appetite for this particular insect. And they would feed it, it ate at them. Great. So we'll introduce the cane toad to get amongst the sugar cane and lessen that creature. When they were checking if the cane toad would eat the creature, they were feeding it dead once. Right? It's a flying creature. Toad doesn't have a tongue like a frog. Can't catch this thing if it's flying. Oh. So, my God, it was of no use at all. Oh my God. In trying to lessen that com population. However, it became like a dominant species. And it was in Queensland, but now it's starting to come in New South Wales. So they're basically marching south. And it's a problem, man. It's, it's like a serious problem. They secrete poison. So if a dog gets interested and the toe gets afraid, the dog can sort of like sniff or lick its head, then get poisoned and that's the end of your dog, you know? But there was a period of time there where there's actually a documentary from the nineties called Cane Toads. And it sort of just points out how crazy people were getting with it. You know, people in a small country towns walking from their house to the pub, taking a cricket bat and just smacking the cane toes off the road as they went. You know, it's like all these people becoming like, you know, crazed with the idea of, of getting rid of the cane toe population. But it, it hasn't affected them. They just keep growing. How much

Is the population now? How big is it?

So big? And these things, Jamie, can you do me a favor? Look up the weight of the largest cane toad that they found. Because it's, it's always a surprise. I mean, these things grow and if they're in the right environment and things that they can eat and feed on, they just get bigger and bigger. That's not the biggest. Look at this thing. Look at this thing, mate.

Whoa. That's like an English bulldog.

Howdy duty. It's bigger than my dog.

Oh my god. Bigger than one. My dogs look at his head. What is the weight on that fucker? What does it

Say?

That's crazy.

Yep.

I gotta find another one to add. Fuck me. Hold on.

I gotta weight there.

It say how big

That was a record. Of course.

It's Oh, fat. That fucker is 2.7

Grams. 5.8 pounds. Wow. That looks bigger than 5.8 pounds.

It does. But it might be a perspective thing either way. I said that

Was the current one.

Oh. Show the video. Scroll up so you can see that video. Or make it larger, like when she's holding it. Yeah. It looks like about five pounds. Boy. Have you ever seen when they, there's a lot of horrible videos online where they take toads and they put 'em in a box with mice. You ever see what toads do to mice? No. You would never think that toads are ferocious. Right. You know, you'd never think that toads are basically monsters. These just giant mouth monsters that swallow mice's hole. But they do. They're super aggressive. It's crazy to watch. Jamie. I know you're gonna get one. I just had to

Make sure it was worth pulling

Up. Is this a good one? Yeah, but there's, there's ones where there's a bunch of 'em in boxes. See, this one is kind of weird because he's not freaking out yet.

He's being sneaky. Oh, what's that? Look at

That head. See him get excited. Look at his head. I mean, if that thing was giant, like that was a hippopotamus shaped chasing after you. Ah, look how quick that is. How did, how did he get it?

He must be closer than it

Looks like. He just swallowed 'em whole. Yeah. Oh, watch how quick he does it. Yeah. This

Bit here. Oh, it's just one step forward and bang. Yeah,

Just snap. Yeah. Go see if he could find one of them video. Oh, he just inhales them. Like, he literally inhaled him. He's got a little bit of a tongue. Oh, he, he grabbed him with the tongue first. Right? He yanked him in. Oh God. See if you can find those videos where there's a ton of them in a box.

We're getting two live feedings of the mice like this.

Either way,

That's a giant bullfrog. It's not a cane to slightly different

Giant African bullfrog either way. Point is they eat mice, they eat 'em whole. Right? And, and how many of 'em are now in Australia? How many million? Oh, here we go. This guy's just gonna go ham. It starts. Oh, he's gonna eat all of them. Look how gross those things are. They look so dumb. Just so mindless and, and gross.

No, I don't think he's gonna get all of 'em. Video's not long enough.

He hasn't gotten any of them. I can, what's going on here

Past it,

Just gathering them in a corner. Ugh.

It's, it's a creepy animal. So and so look, what are the numbers? Like, put that into perplexity

Cane toads.

Yeah. How many cane toads? Ask our sponsor, how many cane toads are in Australia? And what was the initial deposit? Like? How many They drop off that I had it,

It was only a couple hundred. And then they bred like 60,000 in 1937. And the answer for now is estimated at 200 million.

Man. And that little flyer that eats the sugar cane, it's still there. Oh

My god. 200 million. Yeah.

But see, look, if you see where those that see that cluster of light blue balls, right? They basically in there, in the middle of that, that cluster is where they dropped them to start with. And look at how they've,

Well they're gonna make their way across the whole

Country. Oh, there you go. 40, 49. So the white one is actually where they put them to start.

Wow.

And everything else is migration.

And by 2000, look how far they've gone. Mm. Wow. What's the plan to get rid of those things?

I'm not sure that they have a cohesive plan. There's no

Plan. Well, that's the problem. If they have a plan, they're gonna bring in some lizard or something. Yeah. In

Frogs that's gonna end up gonna end up, you know, doing something else. Yeah. It's gonna

Kill everything

Else. Every single time they've done that. You know, like in New Zealand for example, they introduced the goss bush as a way to have hedging instead of fences. But New Zealand's got a way higher rainfall and sunshine hours than England where it came from. So now it's just everywhere, you know. So beautiful arable farmlands just taken over by Gores. And when it grows in Australia, in New Zealand, it grows thicker and more prickly and much harder to, to deal with. We have the same thing in Australia with plants like Lantana just everywhere, all through the bush, you know, in my lifetime. So in 96 I used to be able to walk through certain areas of my property, just under tall trees with, you know, subtropical ferns and vines on the ground. Now there's many areas of my property that are just impossible. You cannot get through it anymore. 'cause it's choked out with introduced weeds.

What is that crazy plant down south that we talked about Once that is overrun some of these forests, it's pretty beautiful, but it's also very creepy to see what it's done. Just like taken over all the trees, all the trees, all the, anything on the ground just covered wisteria. It, it's called kudzu. Kudzu. Yeah.

I'll show you. I'll make sure this is the right stuff. That's

What you're talking about? Yeah. That's it. Look at that. Right?

Isn't

That nuts? Yeah.

Like

That image is creepy. I mean, that's like a steaming

At the back of my place, man. I used to have that waterfalls and creeks.

Look at that. It's taking over that whole building. That's crazy. Everything. Yeah. Just where'd they come from?

See, that's in Fiji.

Yeah, it's in the United States though. So what was it, how was it brought in?

China, Korea, Japan.

Oh, did people bring it in on purpose? That's

Where it's, that's where it's originated from.

Sorry. Right. History of us introduction introduced from Japan in 1876. Yeah. New Orleans Exposition. Oh, that's where I heard there's a lot of it. Vine was widely marketed in the southeast as an ornamental plant, and then it just took

"was. But that against the reality of his life and how he grew up, how he was educated, what his experiences were, who he really was as a man. There's a lot more to Goering than just looking at this going, oh, bad man Nazi. You know, he, one thing I find fascinating, when he was a kid at school, he was like one of the dumbest students in his class at a normal school. And because of his sort of continuous failure as a punishment, he got sent to military school. In military school. He was a top student because it was stuff that interested him. He comes out of school pretty much on the dawn of the first whole war, has his first military experience in the infantry as a young officer gets wounded and realizes that standing on the ground and on a battlefield is not really the right place for him. And what's interesting him is what keeps going on overhead. So he manufactures a way to get himself assigned to a, a fighter squadron is supposed to turn back up for duty with his infantry squadron. But sort of, you know, manufactures a way to keep him as associated with the fighter and learns how to become a pilot while he is doing that. And at A certain point in the war, they're losing more pilots and they train. So they go, he knows how to fly. He can be a pilot, finishes the first world war with 22 kills air to air kills. That's three times the fighting. A and he's also, because he recently passed in battle at the end of the first World War, he's in charge of the Baron v Von Richtofen, the Red Baron Squadron, which is the pinnacle of the German air force. So here he is as a young man, he's finishing that first war experience and he is a fair dinkum, which means true, he is an actual war hero. And so through the twenties he's on cigarette cards in Germany by a packet of cigarettes. And there's a picture of Herman Goring, you know? Wow. So, and he goes into that political environment, that post bizarre environment with a, a very definite belief in his country as being something special. And he wants to make a contribution to bring lifting his country out of the mare that it's, it's currently in. So he starts looking for a political connection and ends up going upstairs in a coffee house in Munich, I think it was. And hearing a fellow called Alf Hitler talk and, you know, realizes that he has a lot in common with this guy. Or he sees things and knows that Hitler was a soldier. You know, it's a funny thing we put into the movie at one point, 'cause there's a speech about Rami that Rami Mallick makes about Hitler being a failed painter and a not very good soldier. And I think the response I gave ing at the time, which is not in the film, but he talks through Hitler's actual military record. And yeah, he didn't, he didn't rise above Lance Corporal, but he turned down promotion three different times. He won an Iron Cross in 1914, and then he won a second one in 1918. And doing things that were showing such extreme courage that he was awarded the Iron Cross. And he, he delivered messages on the battlefield. He would take the messages from headquarters and take it to the frontline troops and then bring their response back. Things like that, you know. So now one point in time I had going say, you know, you call him a failed painter, but maybe he got to A certain point in his life where there were more important things to address than painting. So, you know, nuance, you know,

I thought it was also fascinating that you guys delved into the fact that he was an addict.

Yeah. We only touch on it a little bit. Yeah. But that's, that this crazy, there's really good book blitz. I can don't remember the name. Norman Oler. Blitzed, yes. Yeah. Which gave me on a podcast, which gave a lot of information. 'cause brilliant, when, when go was arrested, he had something like 40,000 pills on him,

40,000

In his car. Right. He had a, a habit of 40 to 50 a day. Right. So you look at him and you can, you can see it when you, when you know that fact and you start looking at photographs, you can see him kind of leave the planet at A certain point where he's just off his tits all the time. You know, from about 42 onwards. He doesn't really have adults' ear anymore. Bels, Himmler, hydric, they've all taken those positions. The things that he promised he could do with the look wafer didn't actually come off, you know, as strongly, they didn't know it at the time, but that's the enigma machine. Everything, the codes being broken. So no matter what they did, they were always being second guessed. So, you know, Hitler's trust of him was adjusted a little bit. And I also sort of liken it to him, knowing he's gonna get stabbed. So he just doesn't bother going to the place where he would get stabbed. You know? So he does a whole bunch of other stuff and he keeps his authority, but he's not at in the center of things anymore from that 'cause

Of the pills. A big part of it,

Big part of it, it's personal safety. 'cause he thinks like he's no longer has the definitive ear and trust of his leader. The pills overtake his lifestyle and he decides to, you know, interest himself in, in other things for the greater good of Germany. Like the collection of great works of art and things like that. You know. But there's a, you know, a lot of things in this story that, that are just bigger once you start looking at it and examining, they're way bigger than what we know or what we commonly understand. And that's what I was looking for, to try and find a way to, you know, understand his base motivations. And at the end of the day, he, he, you know, in his own way, he's a pure patriot, just so happens to be a sort of a, a set of beliefs or whatever that most of us in the, in a western world would call ab barrant.

Wow. And and you gotta take into consideration the drug aspect of the entire Nazi movement. The, all the troops were on meth. Yeah. Hitler was on opiates. I mean, Norman Oler, that book just, I, I can't recommend it enough. It's so eyeopening. 'cause you're like, well that makes sense. That's why they were so fucking psychotic. That's why

They could march through the night where

They could push three nights in a row. Yeah.

Through the, the Belgian forest.

But it's very rarely taught. This is not like when we grew up, we didn't grow up thinking that they were just drug psychotic, you know, animals that were on meth, you know, in, in tanks. And the most, the, the, that gave the people the front line, the most meth. So they had different dosages for different people depending on what they were required to do. And the tank guy got the

Most meth. And if you think about ING's position, he's the one ordering the drugs. Right. How many pilots have we got? How many planes? How many missions are we doing? How many sorties Right? Do that multiplication add? 10%. For me, fucking,

It's a drug fueled war. Like probably the most drug fueled war ever. I mean, the kamikazes were using meth. And then the, the Hitler thing was, I always thought that hi hit Hitler was meth as well. But Norman was saying that he was opiates as well. Right. So just like ging. Right.

They,

Maybe it was how they dealt with what they were doing. They all just stayed blasted outta their fucking head all day long.

Well, I mean, look, you're surrounded by guys that have a sort of a fanatical mindset. You know, you, you're gonna wanna be awake. Yeah. You know, you don't wanna fall asleep at the wrong time if that's the group of people that you've surrounded yourself with. And that's the thing that I keep saying. It's a, it's an old cliche, but I, I think it's something that he, he really learned, you know, if you lie down with dogs, you're gonna get fleas, Herman. Yeah. You know? Yeah. But I think him cleaning up by being forced by being in a prison environment, being forced by the allies to go cold Turkey nearly killed him. He had sort of heart problems because he went from 40 or 50 a day to nothing. So, but that clarity of thought that he had after being clean for, you know, six or nine months when the trial starts, that became dangerous. Because now he's sort of got his faculties back. And his intent on breaking down this whole idea of international law as, as being ridiculous. That, you know, he's a man who served his country. He's still in a uniform. He's still like a, a, a military guy. So he's quote unquote following orders. Yeah. And, you know, they were a demo democratically elected government who then step by step dismantled democracy once they were in power.

And the fascinating thing about this character, and the way you play him is, in the beginning, he seems like a guy on opiates. 'cause he's like so relaxed about everything. You know, it's like he doesn't seem to be carrying the weight of what's happened to him. Right. And for you to, and then there's dark moments, particularly like during the trial where you are like, whoa, there's a lot of range to this guy. And that's gotta be a weird place to be to, for you to try to put yourself in the mind of what ultimately became one of the most horrific figures in modern history.

Yeah. It's not comfortable. It's not comfortable, but that, that pain's part of the gig, you know? Yeah. It, it really is. And there's, you, you, you sort of learn to accept it. And I say this to people quite a lot 'cause they, you know, big question is how do you turn off, you know, when you've been a Nazi for a day, what do you do to relax?

Definitely don't do method.

Yeah. But the, the, you know, you ask anybody and, and you would be the same just because in a little while the podcast is over for the day, doesn't mean that that's the end of your job. Doesn't mean you're just gonna turn off and never think about it again until you're gonna, obviously, you know, anybody has a passion for the thing that they do is gonna continue the process. Five o'clock might be when the office closes, but you're gonna go home, you're gonna have dinner, you're gonna think about the deal that you're currently doing, the presentation that's ahead of you, or whatever it happens to be. You're gonna keep processing. And that's what happens when you, you're playing a character. 'cause you might have delivered x amount of dialogue today, but you've got x amount tomorrow too. So you've gotta keep that process going. So,

So you're just thinking about a Nazi

All the time, time 24 7 all the time. There's no, it's relentless. One, one description of of making a movie is that it's a train journey. It's not like a car, you know, where you can pull over and have a wee on the side of the road. It's a train journey. And once you get on that train, you're staying there until it gets to its destination. And you've just gotta accept that. I mean, and that there's, you know, good and bad. And that there's a, a, a saying that goes with this, you know, the, the best thing and the worst thing about the job that I do is that one day it's gonna finish. Always finishes. You can be having the worst time of your life, but it's gonna finish. But you can be having the greatest time, you know, have the incredible relationship with the crew and the cast and the director. But it's gonna finish. And you have to get used to that. You have to understand that.

When, how much time did you prepare and how much time did you film for? So like how much time were you actually in the head of this Nazi? Well,

I, I signed on in 2019. So

You started thinking about

It then? I thought I was going straight from loudest voice, which finished shooting around April or something like that. And I thought by the end of that year we'd be doing, you know, we would've shot that film.

So that's when you started researching it. Yeah.

And then as it turns out, we got set up and collapsed three different times. And so I had five years, five years of, you know, scratching around trying to find little bits of information to humanize him in my mind, but also for me to try and understand him and understand the, you know, what he got. Because on it, it doesn't make a lot of sense when you read about his history and stuff. And where he gets to doesn't make a lot of sense. He was a mountain climber really. Right. When he was a young man. There are traverses and the Austrian Alps that Herman Goring was the first person to do that traverse of that peak. And you think about the mentality required of a mountaineer to stand at the base of a big ass rock and look up and say, I'm gonna keep going until I reach that summit. That says a lot about who Herman Goring really was and you know, who's Bavarian. Right. So from southern Germany. And once I, 'cause I didn't know he was a mountain climber. Once I knew that, then I started looking around for, well, what does that mean to be a mountain climber? You know, prior to the first World War, what kind of equipment would you have? And it's very basic, man. It's nothing, you know, you gotta, you're relying on your wits and your strength just completely. And yeah,

They didn't even have nylon ropes.

Probably not.

No,

No. But not then. Right. Just all stretchy hemp. Oh Jesus, that's gonna be behave completely differently once it gets wet. But it gave me some real insight to him. But, and it also ended up giving me this great way of connecting to the other German guys who were playing the other Nazis. You know, because I just knew from the first day when they all arrived and they were sitting together in a group, I could see that they were already feeling the punishment of playing that kind of character. So I just brought them together and I asked them, 'cause now you know, these guys, some of them are German, some of them are Hungarian. And I said, look, you know, there's this song that I found and I'd like to learn the song together. And they all, you know, most of them knew the song. But that's what we would do every day as a group. We'd get together, we'd sing that song, and then we'd walk into court together feeling connected as a unit. You know?

What kind of song was it?

It's called Mussi Den.

Is it a German song?

It's a German song. And, well, I didn't realize when I first came across song, it's a Barbarian Mountain song. So he definitely knew that song. It's actually the melody that Elvis Presley uses for the song Wooden Heart in the movie Chi Blues Zoom. Stay late in Hal, stay late in Hal. You know, that's, but I don't have a wooden heart. That's what we're busy singing together. So

You guys would sing this to get into the character

And you Wow. Be the calm. Yeah. So there's just a little thing just to remind that particular group of guys that we we're just actors we're just playing roles and you know, this will finish.

There's a lot of people that don't want to show a human side of a monster. Hmm.

And which I think is very dangerous and quite stupid. You know, because it gives you a complete misunderstanding of what a monster is. You know, that. Yes. Okay. Here's somebody with, you know, horrific expert as the joke used to be. Even Hitler, you know, he used to love dogs. So that's the joke. Right. You know, and, and that, but there's some real truth in understanding the human process in that, that somebody who makes the absolute worst decision in the world can still be a loving father.

Mm.

You know, can still have a group of friends, but on, you know, a particular, in a particular moment that is the same person who's made this horrific decision that will have terrible effect on a, a generation of people.

Yeah. I mean it's, it's really the same kind of thing we were talking about with Tony Soprano.

Right.

Like that this, this person is a terrible person, but yet loves his kids. Right. Loves his friends. Yeah.

Well, charm is one of the greatest weapons of evil. Yeah. You know, it's, it's a really, you know, it's a, it's a fun thing for us. We see somebody, you know, who can tell a story, tell a joke, hold a tension in a room. Yeah. You go, it's cool.","[

Well, charm is one of the greatest weapons of evil. Yeah. You know, it's, it's a really, you know, it's a, it's a fun thing for us. We see somebody, you know, who can tell a story, tell a joke, hold a tension in a room. Yeah. You go, it's cool. But when that process of charm goes to this other place, which becomes about life and death or the're taking away of people's rights, the dehumanizing of people as we were discussing earlier, you know, and there's, you know, I, I don't want to get into politics 'cause I have this, my, my boys have this rule. If you're gonna talk to Joe, you're not allowed to discuss politics.

Because they know once I start your boys, my, my two sons

Yeah's. Because my youngest boy, I think I told you, he, he became obsessed with you and, and listening to your st stuff for a while. And you became one of his sort of points of education and, you know, so that's why I started listening to you. 'cause I wanted to know what he was hearing, you know? And I go and I, I, after listening a few times, I was like, you know what man, it's cool. You know, the 'cause again, we'll use that, that word you do actually have the allowance for nuance. And that's the greatest thing about this situation. We sit down to talk, we're gonna be talking for a couple of hours. Yeah. So I don't have to reduce everything. I wanna talk to you about to make it pop in three minutes.

Right. And worry about things being taken outta context in a soundbite. Right? Yeah. That this is the issue with discussing any positive attribute to a Nazi. You know what I mean? Like, you, you open up that door. Oh my God. Russell Crowe's a Nazi sympathizer.

But the people that

Don't like you are just gonna take that.

Yeah. Yeah. And here's what Joe Rogan's discussing. Yeah,

Yeah, yeah. But it's, I think what you're saying is absolutely true. That it is stupid to think that way because it, because that's a human being and a very fucked up evil human being that did horrific things. But know that that is a path that people can go down even if they think they're doing the right thing. So we

Are taught, for example, to regard Gaddafi in a certain way. Okay. But if you look into what happened in his country while he was the leader, you look into the fact that every person is given a house at a certain age. You look at the fact that everybody's education and healthcare is free. You look at, if somebody showed a particular talent for something that required further education overseas, all of the costs of that were paid for by the government. Now these are all things put in place by the same country's leader that we are told is evil and corrupt.

Yeah.

So it doesn't quite balance.

Well, there's also us government interference. That's a, that's a, that is one that we definitely monkeyed with. I mean, he ran afoul of the United States government, you know,

Well, what he was trying to do, as far as I understand the situation is he was trying to unite Africa and a United Africa is gonna be, it's a problem. Well, either it's gonna be fantastic. Right. It's gonna be amazing.

A problem for the people that wanna run things. Yeah. Yeah. If all of a sudden there's a new Subaru

Power, you've got a whole bunch of countries that, that, you know, have a connection with a certain African nation or whatever that suck their, you know, minerals out of the ground or whatever, don't pay them properly for it. Yep. You know, and and greatly benefit financially. And that's pretty much every European country's got some kind of African connection in that regard. And

Including China.

Well, China's now coming in. Yeah. Because it's able to offer a slightly better deal than they've been used to, you know? But people have to understand you. The population of Africa is enormous. Yeah. Enormous. You've got multiple countries with hundreds of millions of people.

Well, when you see the continent of Africa and you see all these other countries, how many would fit inside of it? You're like, oh boy. Yeah. 'cause that's the weird thing about maps and globes is you get a distortion of the actual true

Size. Well there is a distortion, right? Yeah. Whatever that's called, which shows America at the center and being physically a larger landmass than it actually is in relative terms. Oh, it's

A little bit, it is the size of Australia.

A hundred thousand square miles. Continental USA is a hundred thousand square miles larger than the island of Australia.

That's not much. Not

Much.

That's not much. It's not much, man. Especially when you think that you guys have 20 what? 25? 25. And we have probably 325 plus. Right. I don't think we know really how many people we have, but we have at least 320 million. Yeah, that's a lot of folks.

A lot of people man. Yeah. It's a hell of a lot of people.

So we'd like to think we're a lot bigger than we are, but then you look at where we fit in Africa, you're like, oh, it's like, it's a little tiny little tiny thing.

I think there's someone like 55 countries or something in Africa.

I don't know. It's probably, yeah. I mean it's also Egypt. That's the other thing, you know, it's also like the most advanced civilization possibly that ever existed before today. And they were there too. It's like, it's a wild place. Like from top to bottom. It's a very, and it's the origin possibly of humankind

And a lot more desert, I think, than, than people realize. You know, you have the Sahara and stuff, we all know that. But then there's these other gigantic areas like that. But would that be the West coast? Have you seen those roads in like Namibia or whatever where it's just, it's like a sand dune. It's 40, 50 meters high, drops down to the ocean and there's one little flat bit that there's a road. And that's possible, you know, at certain times or whatever, if the tides are not doing this and that, but that's the road. Jeez. It's like a mountain of sand and an ocean and a one little ribbon.

Geez. It's, you know, United States is one of the weird things about us is that we're, we're a country that thinks mostly of ourselves and hardly ever leaves. You know, some people leave, but yeah, I bet there's a solid percentage of people that never leave the United States and maybe never even leave their city. Right. And your version of the world, you're relying on other people to give you the story of what the world is. Until you go somewhere, until you go to Thailand, until you go somewhere and you're like, wow, there's a totally different way of living out here.

Yeah. I've even had people, you know, come down to help me with movies or whatever, like guys that are coming down to train me and some weapon or other or whatever, and they do a lot of traveling, but it's all within the continental USA.

Yeah.

And they come to Australia and they didn't realize that other people have opinions. You're not gonna find a heck of a lot of agreement to, you know, some very basic tenants. If you sit in an Australian bar, you'll find a whole bunch of people go, that's fucking stupid, mate.

Yeah.

You know? But look, it's still, to me it's the, the greatest country in the world is the United States of America. Absolutely greatest potentials are all here. But how it's founded on balance and fairness and opportunity, that's how it remains. Great. Not because you start taking opportunity away from people. Right. Because you are affording them opportunity. And, you know, just, it's,

Just

Keep that in mind, ladies and Gentlemen. Yes.

Because

It, nothing's finished, nothing's done. We're just in the process and it can all get better. For sure.

Yeah. And it's the rare country that is almost entirely founded by people moving here over time. Yeah.

It's all immigration.

Yeah. Yeah. Which is the strength. And also, you know, the, the problem with the last four years was that they were just letting anybody in and they weren't vetting people. Right. And they were inviting people in. And the problem now is they're grabbing people that are productive citizens and they're grabbing 'em and taking 'em out. 'cause they don't have the right paperwork. Yeah. So neither one is a good solution and both of them cause huge problems. Yeah. And one of the scary things. But

You do have to be aware too, though, a lot of the information that we know about that is coming to us from a motivation that we don't necessarily read. Right. They want us to think of things in negative terms. Sure.

Both sides. On both sides of the issue. Yeah. A hundred percent. Yeah. We're, we're constantly being manipulated. I had Representative Luna on the podcast and one of the things that she said that that, that I kind of knew was probably true, but I didn't wanna believe it. She was like, there's a lot of problems they never solve on purpose, so that they could campaign against them. And that's why they, they keep these things in play. That resolutions could have been reached, problems could have been solved. But these politicians are so self-serving that they don't ever want that to take place. Yeah. These people that run, these two individual parties want to keep that, that banter back and forth. They wanna keep the argument going. And

You see how absolute they are. If you know somebody with that color hat is trying to promote something, you know, the person with the other color hat. So that's absolutely ridiculous. Then it changes. An election happens. Now the person with a different colored hat, they're in charge and they're gonna put in place exactly what they said the other person was doing that was wrong. Yeah. Is now part of their policy platform.

What is wrong with the way Australia's run? Well,

We're a little bit lucky at the moment. We have a prime minister who's very much motivated by trying to help everybody, you know, which should be the job of a politician, right? Sure. To improve the lives of the people that they represent. And he's kind of inherited, You know, a conga line of stupidity that was going on, you know, and he's trying to fix things. But of course, just the way things are reported, whatever, you know, there's, there's haters on every corner. But he's a good man and he's doing his very best and he's, you know, working extremely hard. But, you know, like he arrives off a plane the other day. He's just come back home from some very successful international meetings where he is established various trade things and, and opportunities and situations for Australia. Gets off the plane wearing a Joy Division T-shirt. Right. Big band from his youth. And he's just a relaxed character. You know, he's been wearing a suit and tie for weeks on the road. He's just walking off Australia's version of Air Force One in the Joy Division t-shirt. So the member of the opposition wanted to point out and did so in parliament that joy division is a Nazi term and comes from a section of a particular camp where the women were prostituted. And that's why it was called the Joy Division. And it's like, okay, what's the point of that? Right. We all know it's a band name. We know it's, it's a band name. Right. And just 'cause you like the Rolling Stones doesn't mean that you want rocks to be falling on people. What are you fucking talking about? You know, this whole stupidity and that's what you're facing all the time. Picking up some pointless piece of minutia and, you know, lighting it on fire and making a smokescreen to cover up the reality of the fact that that Prime Minister just worked his ass off on behalf of the country and successfully achieved a bunch of things and should be patted on the back, you know, not pushed down the stairs.

Yeah. Well we have a lot of that here too. That's,

But there is a timidity to a timidity I think is probably the thing in terms of how Australia is run. Things like the, the gambling ads and stuff like that. Common sense would tell you this is not a good thing to allow, you know, put the timing of these ads back so kids are asleep or whatever. Don't let them read out the odds on the news that you could fix that pretty quick. But that gambling section of the community is worth a lot of money and people in positions of power. 'cause it's not necessarily, you know, it's, it's not the guy that's gonna spend his whole wages gambling through an app that, that gets to have a say in this. You know, it's the guy whose family money allows him to run a string of 18, you know, race horses and he enjoys going to the races on the weekend. And, you know, gambling for him is not such a big deal because he's got, you know, an income from other things, blah, blah, blah. You know, so it's the wrong perspective on a problem sometimes is the actual problem.

Mm. And the fact that this is a fairly new thing and that young people growing up with this, there's not a history of people abusing gambling apps. Right. It's not, it's not something their parents had to deal with. It's

Right. Generationally. It's not something that I can, oh, I, you know, from my experience, I can tell you this, so I had to have a, you know, when I had that conversation with my boys, it was a broader conversation about gambling and about, you know, what it takes to earn a dollar.

Yeah. The, I think the accessibility issue is something that people have problem with. The fact that it's on a phone versus going to a place, right. You choose to, you're gonna get your buddies together. You are gonna go play poker in a casino. Right. That's a different decision, right. Yeah.

Than just sitting at home. Yeah. You know, and just constantly frittering away your money. Well

This is the thing, it's just we are, there's always some sort of point of attack. There's always an attack vector for people getting your attention or getting your money and trying to, and then we have to decide as a society, like do we, is this good to just allow, like we want freedom, but do we want to, like you can't advertise cigarettes on TV anymore. Right. They decided at one point in time, this is crazy. Cigarettes are bad for, you can advertise

"eople than cigarettes.

That funny thing that we have that was fed to us that, you know, cigarettes are this incredible burden on our health healthcare system. In reality, if you look at it, it's a burden. But, you know, there's a lot of people dying of lung cancer who've never had a cigarette. So we haven't really solved that. We don't really know where that's coming from. But in reality, the burden on our healthcare system is obesity and all the problems that come from obesity. That's the biggest. Yeah. We allow food production systems that we know to be extremely unhealthy and very bad. We just allow them to continue on. You know, we've got items of quote unquote food that have been tested and turns out there's no actual food in this. It's just, you know, a manufactured product. I think the, the famous one here was the, the Twine thing. Right? When they actually got around to looking at what was in a twine, they realized that every single part of it was completely unhealthy. Yeah.

It's just mostly sugar, right? Yeah. Yeah. But Twinkies are delicious and I think you should be able to buy Twinkies, you know what I mean? So I, I'm on both sides of it. I'm a healthy person. I eat 99% of my food is very healthy, but I think you should be able to do whatever the fuck you want. It's just education is the most important thing. And letting people know what they're, and then teaching people some discipline and how to be able to exercise some control over yourself.

So I was 126 kilos when I finished Nuremberg.

Mm.

I'm a hundred 0.9 right now.

That's amazing. Congratulations. Well,

A lot of that.

You look great by the way. Thanks. Really do

A lot of that is because you introduced me to your mate Brigham

From Waist Towell. Yeah. Yeah.

And so I've probably connected with them about five times since that first time we went. And the real benefit that I'm getting that I think, right, because I'm not, not completely over the science, but it seems to be with these injections that I've been getting into my shoulders, into my knees, but also IVs that it's calmed down my body's inflammation. You know, I think we talked before about just how many old injuries I carry, you know, and how like the injuries in my shoulders have a deeply arthritic, but we can now see in an ultrasound over time how, what was messy a year ago and like big thick bands of of arthritis now it's just lessened. You know, probably by about 70% on one area of my right shoulder, probably about 90%. So my range of motion, if we'd done this last year, would've been about there. Right. But now is fucking rock and roll something, you

Know what I mean? Isn't that great? It's all

Going good, you know? I know. It's amazing. And like, just feeling like the musculature starting to build and everything. I'm taking it really slowly. And that was one of the things I was worried about with Highlander because jumping into that role with the shooting date coming, it was like, man, I've gotta do, I've gotta do three workouts a day. I gotta, you know, and that for me is a bad recipe because yeah, I can, I can do that for X amount of time, but once I stop, I'm gonna stop completely. You know? And what I want to do is I wanna make all these changes and make it a long-term situation. So I think the Waste two world was a great call for me because it's calmed down a bunch of stuff. It's taken a bunch of pain away, you know, so I can go and work out and not have to suffer for two or three hours afterwards. Yeah. You know, you know, I'm still picking up injuries 'cause I've gotta face the fact I'm 61. Yeah. You know, like the other day I'm doing my cat guitar dinosaur trying to get this fricking move going on. A fricking tore the tendon here on the ulnar. Ugh. So that's gonna be bad for sword fighting, but I'm trying to fix that without having to have a, a surgical,

How bad is it torn?

It's only a little bit really, you know. Okay.

You just gotta make sure you don't overuse it while it's healing. Can you brace it? Well

The, the, the problem I've got is I've got X amount of time to claim the skill and either way, right. If I do the rehab exercises without doing surgery, if it fails, I'm now falling right on production and you know, of re torn or something. Right.

But I can help you with that. Just do this skill slowly.

Yeah.

Here's the thing about skills. Skills that you learn slowly. You can translate into high speed quickly. Yeah. Because you develop a neural pathway. So instead of using an actual sword, use a foam sword use like one of those little fucking noodle things that people put in the pool. Use that. So you're just, just develop them. When I was teaching martial arts, one of the things that I always tell people is don't try to do it quickly when I show you something, I want you to do it slowly.

That's exactly what I did. Yeah. I'm in a car park and we were talking about the speed of something and I went, oh yeah, so you get sh and I went, oh fuck.

And I

Knew I to, but I just put my sword away and I kept the conversation going. Didn't mention it, but I got home and I was like, oh fuck.

Oh, you rushed, you didn't warm up. Yeah.

Well the thing is we were warm, but it was a thing that I just, just in that split second, I thought, I wonder what it's like to go full speed. Oh. And I did it and I, and I just like, no way too early. But you're absolutely right. Pace is deceptive. Yeah. If you learn something, I mean, you know, that's like that old fashioned sort of stuff with with with the karate I first did when I was a kid, you know, they aim for you to do 10,000 of something before you have to use it in an actual competitive fight. You know?

Yeah. People who train people with guns have a saying, slow is smooth, smooth is fast.

Right? Yeah.

Yeah. Absolutely. You want herky jerky movements and with martial arts and specifically sword fighting, it's, there's very specific movements that you're learning. And if you learn those movements slow as you speed up, you'll be going along the right pathway. And when I would teach people kicks in particular because it's a weird thing to learn how to kick something. Like you've gotta do it slowly. 'cause if you try to muscle it, you're gonna develop a bad habit that's gonna keep you from achieving full power because you want a proper technique. Yeah. And

You have to process where your balance is. Yeah. You know, what you, how you're pushing your force, but how you retain Yeah. You know, the ability to reset. Yeah.

Yeah. Juujitsu as well. People that learn by drilling, they get way better, way quicker by doing it flowing and doing it more easy and play like the Gracie's always say keep it playful. Yeah.

Like that's, well see the thing is I know all this stuff, but I was in such a point of weariness that I was just trying to please people. Right. Oh. And so I muck myself up and you know, but I've got a bit of time now for it to heal and for me to start and actually do like, I like to do, you know,

Have you visited Brigham while you're here?

Yeah. Yeah. I saw him missed that. Okay, great. Yeah, he's looking great.

Yeah, he looks great, right? Yeah. He is looking good.

He'll look you up the new, the new place. And now here's the thing. We talk about this and your listeners would probably, you know, it's expensive. No two ways about it. So it's possibly not at everybody's grasp what the sort of things that I'm doing. But I think, I'm not sure if this is absolutely right, but I think, you know, one of his sort of fervent ambitions Brigham, is to make it more available. Yes. You know, because this should be, this is cutting edge medicine. Yes. You know, if we can sort of write things in our bodies with an injection as opposed to an operation, you know, the problem I had in my left shoulder, I go and see my shoulder surgeon who fixed it while I was doing Cinderella, man. And so I did two operations with this guy, one in 2001 and the second one in 2004. But it's always had a sort of problem. And, and he did say at the time, after the second operation, that he had to cut a few corners and it would probably cause me problems later on in life. So I probably went to see him about five or six years ago and he said, okay, so you are, this shoulder is at a point of arthritis. Now what we have to do is we have to cut through the muscle bar, we have to pop out the humeral head of your arm bone. We have to shave off the top of the humal head and then we have to put a carbon fiber cap and then we have to put it back in. So everything back up, you've got about 12 months of rehab. Right. Just sounds wrong. You know, it just sounds wrong. It's like, you know, so this process that I've been going through with Brigham, basically having the effect of layering so I can now see that if the arthritis was that deep, it's now this deep, you know, it's still there. I haven't solved it yet, but I'm giving my body what it needs to make it better.

Also, there's new breakthroughs almost every week, right. And these new breakthroughs, they're, they're able to achieve the, the, they're, they're growing actual cartilage on people that were bone on bone. Right? So they're, they're developing new methods to regenerate tissue. That's the cushioning in between your, your knees and your elbows and all these things that were, and shoulders that we're requiring people to get those horrific things. Putting an artificial joint in place. 'cause everything is so arthritic.

That's one of the things that does trouble me greatly in for this country health medical systems to benefit everybody. Something has perverted here where, you know, the drug that I might need that I can buy for $50 for a month supply in Australia is two and a half thousand dollars for a month here. Yeah. Come on man. I know what's going on. It's crazy. You know, and where's, see you've got all these elected representatives here and this country's got, you know, a lot, you know, that's what you should be working on man. You know? Yeah.

But they can't

Because everybody's got their, their hands

500 back. Everybodys their hands tied. Yeah. They're all got their, including the media. That's the crazy things. The amount of money they spend on advertising for the media that really just serves the purpose of now the media can't criticize the pharmaceutical drug companies. Right.

Wild. Yeah. Wild. It's interesting. It's because, you know, I get back here as you know, you know, my girlfriend's from New Orleans and you know, we're sitting and watching TV here and she's now seeing America from the outside. 'cause she spends most of the time traveling with me. And we don't spend that much time in, within America. You know, we live in Australia, but we've been, I've been working mainly in, in, in Europe the last few years. So she's now coming back to her country, but she's got fresh eyes and she's sitting there the other night she was watching something. She came out, she said, I've just watched like 12 ads for drugs. Right. Just one after the other, after the other, after the other. You know what, what's this tiny little problem that you might have? Or you know, if I can say it in a certain way to make you think that you've got it, bang, I got a drug for it. Bang, bang. You know? And yeah. I mean 600,000 plus people in this country in the next 12 months will go bankrupt because of their medical bills. You know how many people will go bankrupt in Australia because of their medical bills in the next 12 months?

Zero. Zero.

Yeah.

Yeah. It's one of the biggest problems we have. You know, and the idea that you would let that happen and not do anything about it because you're bought and paid for by these enormous companies is kind of insane. Yeah. It's insane. And they're trying, they're trying to do something about that, you know, and RFK junior's fighting an uphill battle trying to do something about that. But it's a captured industry.

Yeah. Yeah.

And you know,

The

Fact socialized medicine, fact,

Probably the fact the largest western economy is punishing its citizens in that way. Yeah. Just beggars belief. That's crazy that healthcare isn't such a principle thing. 'cause if, if, if we're not looking after ourselves and aiming for the longest life, what's the point of the human existence kind of thing. You know what I mean? So that should be a principle. Everybody's health should be a principle focus of our elected representative. Well

"like, making them hold hands and like touching them hands. I made

Them shake, they

Made them shake hands in front and they, I watched them reluctantly do it, but it never changed. Luis came back with a real sense of like, I did something good there, but those guys never stopped glaring at each other the whole time. They

Probably kill each other in the parking lot afterwards.

And then the guy comes over to Luis. But towards the end of the thing, or maybe it was to me, he just did it. But like, he came over and, and I was like, ah, you guys all good? And he goes, what the fuck was that man?

He's like, those guys fucking started shit with us. And then your friend made to shake hands with him. They had no, there was no beef squashed whatsoever. But Luis, he really, but just the fact he went over

There and ma he made them shake hands. They did it.

But at least, even if you just make someone shake hands, it deescalates a little bit. It definitely deescalates more than there's no out. Yeah, because the problem with guys is when they don't feel like they have an out with dignity, they just keep talking shit. Yeah. And then they get themselves into a problem. There's

An ego thing that happens where you're like, well there, there has to be an end to this story. Exactly. And in my mind, when I'm angry, it has to be me beating your fucking ass. Or

If the end comes in, the cops come and makes you shake hands. Yeah. And that's the end. Yeah. And you avoid the violence. It's

A logical, logical end.

The problem we're having now, especially if we go to like these metal shows is Luis had a, a gripe with a guy at a concert two concerts ago. He went through a real thing. He's like, nineish Nails. Yeah. Nineish Nails. He's like this fucking guy over here. And then Luis was having a hard time letting it go. And then when it got push came to shove near each other, it's like security was come over and he goes, Hey, that guy's like a fan of yours. Yeah.

I can't freak out anymore. I do the, I do Rogan and kill Tony. I mean, Luis would know who I am. So I can't have public outbursts. Luis,

Luis since we were, since I was, I was kind of almost like making us move. So Luis would stop obsessing over like dealing with the guy. 'cause I guy, I, I, me and Luis share a lot of similar traits in that way. I'd do the same thing. So I'm like, we're gonna move somewhere else. And as we're moving, Luis goes up to the guy in his ear and starts whispering in the guy's ear. And I'm watching the guy nod his head Yes. He's like, yeah, yeah, yeah. And then they finally, I kinda get Luis away and I go, what did you say in his ear? He goes a bunch of terrible, awful things that I was gonna do to him. My god. He was just nodding yes. And then the security came over like 15 minutes later and was like, Hey, that guy just went, you know, he's like, he's a fan. He's a fan of yours. And like Yeah. And the security knew us too. He was like, also I love your guy's stuff too. But that guy I think is also a fan. I lost a

A fan. That too. That guy literally will never like my shit ever again.

Yeah, you fucked up. Yeah.

It's all right.

It's

Also nineties Nails is such not a tough, like, it's not tough music. It's like goth chick music. Fucking

All of us had mascara ringed in our face, having these fights. I'm gonna punch you because my dad didn't care. What's this? Did you go, did you go to a lot of concerts growing up?

Yeah.

What kind of bands were you into though? Were the crazy shows.

You know, I'm so much older than you guys. So when I was in high school was the eighties. So like the first band I ever went to see live was the Jay Gilles band. Nice. Yeah. Peter Wolf like, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, of course. No, that's fine. Remember Center Fold. He was huge back then. And, and then I saw George Thero. Good. I saw George Thero good with some other dude. Oh, Johnny Winter. That's who it was. Damn. The albino dude that

Is ugly motherfuckers. He went to go

See. Oh my God. It was amazing. That was amazing.

George Thero Good. Looks like fucking rusty from European vacation. Does he look

Like that now? Is that what you're saying

Now? I mean, he looks terrible. No, back then he always, he always, that really is, it's music for like ginger guys to fix a car and do this to, it's George Thurgood. It's

Man a 1981 song. It's what it is. It's like a great song from 81. That's what he was. The speech there, he was bad to the bone. Nah, no. Nah, nah. The

Speech in the, in the beginning of One Bourbon, one shot, one beer. Yeah. One of my favorite thing a look

Man.

Come down now.

Yeah. So I, yeah, I I did see a bunch of concerts when I was in high school.

Boston. Boston. I mean, it's a big city for shows.

Yeah.

But did you go as a kid? I, I, I feel bad. I never went.

Well I worked at a concert venue too for a while. I worked at Great Woods. Oh yeah, yeah, yeah. So I was security guard and Great Woods. Was this performance, I think it's still around. Yeah.

Amphitheater.

Yeah, it's like an amphitheater. And the problem with that place is if anybody was talking on stage, you could only hear it underneath the thing. You couldn't hear it in the lawn. So like, lyrics would bleed out into the lawn like, or, you know, someone doing comedy would bleed out into the lawn. It was a nightmare when comics performed there. Right. Because you got tickets on the lawn. You couldn't understand what the fuck they were saying. It was just all this weird echo

Shit. I did comedy in front of Slipknot and Corn there in the place, in, in that venue particularly. Did you really?

Yeah, yeah. Yeah. I saw Dangerfield there when I was working there. I saw Bill Cosby there when I was working there. The Cosby, I wasn't paying attention though. I, I had no intention.

Be trial. You gotta pay attention on that

Guy. Well, I was 19 years old and I just had no patience. I had no intentions of ever ever being a comedian. Well

He would do like three hours. Right. Like, he would do like really, really long shows. But it was the same, it was always the same act. Right.

Yeah. Were they that long?

Two and a half. I heard it was, yeah,

He was there. I believe, I'm trying to remember who else. Definitely. I, I paid to see Kinison there. That was wild. And then

Do you think people like Kinison would've grown with the times?

No. I, I think Kenon, he would've had to sober up and if he sobered up, I don't know if he'd be the same thing. He's like the best example of a guy who was maybe the greatest and most influential comedian of all time for like a year. Like when he came, there was a, a moment when he was talking about like Jesus on the cross. You know, I think his laps words were, I'd be,

Oh, not my

Left hand, not my left

Hand. You can help me if I if you get, if you get it back of a hammer.

It was like completely different kind of comedy. Yeah. The thing about homosexual necrophiliac paying money to be with the freshest male customers, you know, going to the mortuaries and paying money that bit is fucking crazy. It's so funny. Oh yeah. The bit about the starving kids in Africa, like holy shit man. But it, it only lasted for a short window and then the stuff after that, he was partying so much. The material was not anywhere near as good. It was all like, the points weren't interesting.

But do you think he had it in him to evolve?

He would've had to fucking clean his act up? I think, I think what you're seeing is a guy, first of all who develops his act over like 10 years before he gets, before he makes it. And when he makes it, he's fucking good. I mean he's like one of the best ever. And then he has to come up with a whole new act in a year. But he's just doing coke and he's partying and he's hanging out with Bon Jovi's.

Well that's, that's like what, and it is like with everybody, it's like everyone does their first like album or special and it's like a collection of everything for a decade or 15 years. And then it's like you're supposed to reproduce that every year or two after that. Like Bill Barr and Luis CK sort of created this standard of putting out a brand new hour every year or two, which is like almost

Ginger assholes. You heard here first. Where's my camera? You ginger asshole.

It's almost unsustainable to like do it.

The George Thoroughgood you fucking rusty looking piece of shit. Well,

The thing is, is like, why, why do we care if that's what they want to do? Like why don't we just do what we do? Why, how, why are we even comparing? That's the thing. 'cause

When I show up back at, when I show up back into another market a year later and I'm doing the same material, I feel like a fucking asshole.

I do. Yeah.

Well you probably should, but you also probably should just go at your own pace. You know, some people wanna think of a special as a special. Like this is the best shit that I've come up with over the last five years or whatever. Yeah. And some people want to think like, no, it's just like, keep releasing new comedy. But we all know that your comedy, your jokes get better when you keep tuning them up. Of course. Right? And that I think it's a certain amount of a cooking process that they all need. Well it'll,

They'll, it'll just continue to get better. I just filmed the special and now I've been work 'cause it's not out yet. So I've still been working the material and now you

Got new tags.

It's pissing me. That's because comfort the worst. Oh my God. It's the worst. The best tags.

The best tags. There's

Comfort

Always.

That's because that's because you're more comfortable now. Yeah. I said your best recording, who's recently your best recording of your hours is never gonna be the hour you recorded. Right. It's not gonna be that one. Yeah. I remember when I did my, when I did my last like material special dog belly, it was like, man, really wish we could have gotten that seven o'clock show on Friday in Buffalo. Buffalo Helium just ate it up. That's the show where you were done. And I was like, this is it. This is the rhythm of it. And this is the one.

Yeah. It's like when there's something on the line and it's like ready record. It's just a different thing. It's

Like, live

Is crazy. Yeah.

But I did that because I was scared of

It. How, how nerve wracking was that? Oh,

So weird was so much. D was your

So I think,

Were you freaking out? 'cause he flubbed

His joke. Another thing stolen from the black man. Write it down

Luis. It wasn't mine dude. I just wanna say it was Netflix idea, but because

He, he flubbed the line in his, like his last bit, which was like the line. I know. Whoopsies

Ah, yeah, I definitely treated different than any other set. He's like, when

I fresh the Slap Prince shit, fuck me. Running

Cut.

Oh no positions,

First positions

Everyone.

Yeah, it's a weird thing, man, to just go ready live, go to like millions people. It's a weird thing, but I, I was in, in my head I was like, but why, why is it any different than a show? Well, it's all your mind fucking yourself. So what it, what would it prevent you from mindfuck yourself? Just go over your material with such a fine tooth comb that when you get up on stage, you, you can be just loose and completely relaxed. You're not even thinking about where to go and how to do it. You're just thinking about like locking in and you're gonna be live for an hour. And I was like, God, it's fucking terrifying. Like, let's see what, let's see what that feels like.

Did you fuck up anything that we didn't know

About? No. Nope. Felt exactly like a regular set. And I, I did one set there Friday night that we filmed as well that didn't go live. And then the Saturday night one was completely live and it was, you know, I had already done the room so I was relaxed. I got a feel for the room, you know, because of Friday night. It was a lot of fun. The show was great and I was like, okay, we're ready. And then Saturday, just all day going over material watching recordings. I just saturated my brain so I could just be completely relaxed when I went out there. So it was like 100% prepared as opposed to like a regular Tuesday night where you could just kind of go on stage like, you know, you know your acts, you know, you go on stage, you start opening up and getting into your bits, but you're not like meticulously dialed in. Yeah, I

Told Netflix I would that I would do it with crowd work live.

Oh, you totally should. And

They, I mean they were, they were, they didn't respond to his email.

No, they, I said the same thing.

They responded. They just, they're

Like, we don't wanna get sued.

I told Netflix I would do a feature film for them. They just didn't get back to me.

Ah bro, they didn't have to see you one weekend. They'd be like, are you fucking crazy? No,

I love that. Say but again, almost like what you're saying though, to me, it's like I, I'm not, I'm not saying that I wouldn't be nervous to, I would be very nervous doing that. And that would be kind of the fun of it. Like being that amped up to do it. Yeah, definitely. You, I think you'd also like, especially with it being crowd workout was like, you'd see it kind of unfold. You know what I mean? Yeah. Like you kind of see like the, the pacing and the build of it. 'cause I have to do it for an hour. It'd be interesting. Yeah.

And you got you. That's one of the things like you have to be doing a lot of sets leading up to That too. To be relaxed. Yeah. You know,

They filmed, they secretly filmed 'cause I was filming on Saturday and they filmed my Friday shows without telling me, oh. And I fucking killed. And that was like the biggest like relief because Bobby Kelly directed it and he was like, dude, we got it. He was like, like we got the show. Like what? I thought they were just testing the cameras. He

Just wanted to go home. I think that's the one. Dude, you

Don't need me anymore,

Dude. We got it dude.

Dude. It's perfect. He's Watch it all

Set, dude. You nailed it. Looks

Like we're all

Like yeah, once you know you got it in the can. Beautiful. And it's lifted off of your back. What a weird fucking art form. You know? Very strange. Don't those are dice's cigarettes. I

Know

The unlit

Unlit broken.

He just have these cigarettes and he just breaks 'em and puts 'em in there.

The unlit

Unlit broken.

He just have these cigarettes and he just breaks 'em and puts 'em in there.

Jay just quit smoking cigarettes. But he needs to smoke cigarettes on the podcast. I, I asked, I was like, I was like, how, how come? He's like, I'm gonna smoke now. I was like, I was like, why? He was like, it's like three hours dude. And I was like, the hours are gonna exist whether we're on podcast or not.

But other than that you had quit smoking.

Yeah. Like stay loose though. You know, when I came in, when we did the show last time two times ago at the end of the show I was like, I gotta go smoke. And Jamie went, you can smoke in here. I went, oh really? He goes, yes. And then last time we came and I did smoke and when it was done caught like wearing lucky underwear or something. I was like, we had a good flip back and forth. We were all giant. We made the Rogan Sphere. We

Did. Yeah.

We officially got the Rogan Sphere. We've been repping hard out there in the streets.

We tell everyone,

I get my credit to go from The Bonfire Legion of Skanks and most notably the Rogan Sphere.

The Manosphere is a real subject. Like the people believe that it's real. That there's this like coalition of men, like trying to convert young boys into the evil ways of being a man. The Manos fear.

I think that's the same thing as the Rogan Sphere.

No, the mans the Manos. It's like there's levels to it. But you saying it wrong, like Andrew Tate's the highest level of the manosphere. Oh right, of course. Right. That's yeah, yeah. That's top G of the manosphere. Of course if you're like categorizing those things, the thing that you're most terrified of is a guy like Andrew Tate. I

Was never like stoked on that. Kinda like, yeah if

I, if I a young like Ukrainian girl. Yeah.

I've never been to that. Kinda like the Maxim magazine, spike tv. Like energy of what they're like this is what, cause when you see oh a car crash and a girl with big, I had a

Max

Magazine subscription,

FHM The thing

About it is, yeah, you're right. But also it works. No. You know why try to reinvent the wheel?

No, it definitely works. I pulled myself out of that thing. So I was like, this isn't my like getting a Max magazine, like hometown chicks in their bikinis. I'm like, these girls would never talk to me. I just have like too much self-loathing to be into it. Dude, if you could

Make, here's

Fancy clothes. Well I don't fit in those clothes. Like everything was just a bummer outta those magazines. So I would just get straight pornography.

Yeah.

And even

Now, because you, you can get those

Girls. No, well sometimes I would, I'd always buy the three packs and one of them would have to be like Jugs or Voluptuous Magazine. Oh, then in the

Middle there's always one with a bunch of gross chicks

Or just straight trans. But I always believe when I was young, when I was young going through my dad's, I found my dad's porn collection and there was a couple of weirdies in there, like a couple of trans or like local personal ads. And then as I got older and started buying the three packs, I was like, let's just believe that was the third one. He didn't know what it was. But then why'd you keep it? Yeah. Toss it. Dude.

Did you see that Don Lemon got in trouble because he, he, he said that Megan Kelly looks trans.

It's just a straw jaw strong jawline. Please

Google this to find that if this is true or we'll be in trouble. I don't wanna get sued by Don Lemon. He said

Clockable Sora works again.

What did he say the word was? Clockable is what I said. Clockable. Yeah. Look, just pull up the actual thing that

Put,

But people were saying, oh my God. Like he's actually using, you look trans as an insult. Do you know how crazy that is?

She

Doesn't outspoken. L-G-B-T-Q Ally Don Lemon faces backlash after claiming me Kelly looks trans.

Oh. Oh it blew up in his face. I see.

Oh

You

Know how funny that is.

Oh, didn't that happen with what's her name? A OC Just she called. She was making fun of somebody for being short some like other like dude. And now everyone's like trashing her 'cause she was like, you can't make fun of short people. Hey

Go back to that. Go back to the that what? What he said it says Lemon said he thought Kelly looked chopped. He said, I think she looks trans. Lemon said in response, Lemon's co-host wrapped up the show saying let's end on that note.

That's fantastic bro. That

Editor hates him. There's no way that editor doesn't hate him to say, let's end on that.

Clockable ISS a hilarious thing to call a woman. That

Is so crazy. But that's, well also he's gay, right? So he doesn't know that Megan Kelly's hot. She's he's dangerous like super smart lawyer, hot,

You know. Is he out gay? I don't follow himself. No. He's like an out gay guy. Dumb lemon.

Oh

Yeah, yeah. Dumb lemon's. Married to a guy,

Black guy.

I think he's married to a white guy.

Yeah, yeah. You're not gonna put a black guy on your butt.

Jesus Christ.

That's what they do.

Are you

Sure that's what gay sex is? I don't know. This is probably the first Mrs. Permeated the Rogan sphere. Yeah. Gay sexist.

You think the manosphere would know something about this? But

So when I was a kid, when I was, when I was young, like there was no online obviously. And the first time I ever saw gay porn was a girl that I met at a comedy club. I met this lady at a comedy club. I was like 22 maybe. And we go back to her apartment in Long Island and she goes, gay guys lived here before me. And I go, how do you know? And she goes, 'cause they left a tape. I go a tape of what? She goes, it's a gay porn. I go, shut up. And she goes, do you wanna see it? I go, okay. So she puts it on and it's these two guys and this guy pulls this guy shorts down and pushes him up against the tree and just starts sucking his cock. And I'm like, I gotta get outta here.

That's how it always like,

That's enough for me. I already came. I

Was like, I didn't know that that done really happened. You know what I mean?

It was weird right? The first time I, 'cause I moved to New York City when I was 19 and you didn't really experience homosexuality until you're in a big city like that. And the first time I saw two guys like kissing, it looked like aliens. Like it was the right, the craziest thing ever. And now we're so desensitized to it. 'cause everything in the media. Media,

Well 'cause porn, we were so desensitized 'cause so many people have seen porn. But like seeing gay porn when I was 20, I knew that they had sex. I didn't have a problem with that at all. But it was the shocking reality of watching a guy, just another guy. And you're like, yo,

It's jarring. No doubt I gotta

Get outta here.

Yeah, it's definitely jarring. Can

I take this tape with me? Do

You see like, that's disturbing. It was very disturbing.

Yeah. I So if anytime you see it, it's, it just looks wrong. It looks like the wrong thing is happening. Oh well Shut

It off. Shut it off. They,

I can't, they seem have a fantastic time doing it. They

Seem to have a wonderful time. Some people like spicy food.

Some people don't ever see, you ever seen a movie Fright Night?

Probably

The old or Nine Seven. Six Evil. They were two like har popular horror movies. I think

I remember Fright

Fright Night. The one that played evil ed. His best friend, the kid's best friend when times got Tough did gay porn. Man, he got, it was like really hardcore. It was as jarring as, like I said, when like China did pornography, you're like, damn dude, this guy was not in this world. And then the girl from Boy Meets World does porn now. Aggressive black gang bang. Pornography, gay porn. No, no, no. She's, it's a girl. Oh. Which

Girl?

She was on later seasons of Boy Meets World. I think Maitlin Ward. Her name is such, she just does pornography now. But like, like a lot of it in her butt. Whoa. Okay. Yeah. Yeah. B, B, C. Thank you. Industry term. Jesus Christ. That's an industry term conversation.

Took a dark turn.

Big black hawk. Nice. Good work. Dark turn. We'll be right back after these messages. Yeah.

Porn. I still watch porn here and there, but it's just gotten to the point where it just, every time I watch it and I start jerking off, I feel like this sense of like, like almost like if somebody was watching me right now, how pathetic this would look. Yeah. Like you're like beating your dick like a monkey. Like

Somebody probably is watching you. Probably. There's probably, yeah. There's probably someone's collecting information of you.

Of how I jerk

Off. Yeah. For either through your front facing camera or through the, the camera on your, on

Your good thing that in my facial recognition pictures of this.

Oh,

Take that picture all you want. You're not gonna get in any doors with that. It's

Nick. We all kind of know it, right? Like they, we know that the camera all on, but we still jerk off right in front of our computers. You know what's

Weird? We

Piece of tape over it and I'm like, let 'em see.

Weird. It's weird that porn is free basically. Like you just go on a website and you can watch it. But also they're still making it

Sort of, I think the studios are like almost barely making anything anymore. It's all like OnlyFans check out.

Yeah. But even that, yeah. Like just imagine this is the thing. What I'm saying is nobody's seen it at all. Why are you making new ones? Like no, there's no way. Yeah. There's enough supply for the, or demand rather for the supply. There's so much porn. Yeah.

It's weird though. I still will go back to like my favorite.

I was gonna say, but also if you, if you're pretty genre specific, you will see 'em all eventually. Yeah.

You've seen every Jay's seen everything

Genre specific. That's such a good point. Well, lobster

Tube takes me through it alphabetically, you see? So yeah,

Ai, AI porn is not AI porn. VR porn. Oh,

AI porn is coming bro. Oh, AI

Porn.

You're gonna be able to have Art Bell having sex with, you know me,

You

Finally.

Yeah.

Luis J Gomez finally.

Well like they already did the, remember it was that all the Taylor Swift getting like gang bang by the Kansas City Chiefs? Oh,

Like the president smacking her ass.

They have done already.

Oh yeah. That was

Not gang. It was, they were very, it was AI pictures of Taylor and she was just like in, in a crowd.

There's just Taylor. This guy knows her.

There's guys like grabbing her ass

Firsthand basis.

It was her like sitting on Trump's lap and it was like, they were like actually really good. Yeah.

And then Taytay, they took some pictures of her. I call her Taytay. Nice. They, but no, I thought they were her, her getting like fucked by like the Chiefs. But I think it was funny. I, I believe she came out and was like, everyone, those aren't me. Which is like fun. It's a funny acknowledgement to have to make guys. I didn't get gang bang by the Kansas City Chiefs. Well

You know, some 15-year-old girls in school and her friends are like, yeah, it was real.

She really

Did get get, you're like, you need Taylor to come out and say it. Right. Hey guys, it wasn't me

Everybody. That wasn't me, but isn't

It crazy that,

So I've been reading my dreams

That good now that you can't tell. I

Think you couldn't, can't tell. That's almost the thing. It's,

I don't think anymore, man. I think,

I don't know why they can't figure, remember the big tail is like fingers, hands, and fingers.

It's like if you watch I am legend like the cgi, I Oh yeah. Looks terrible. Yeah.

Yeah. My mom used to have a, an I am legend poster on a bedroom wall that I assume she masturbated to.

And then you'd forget the name of the movie all the time.

Not I Am. Oh, I'm sorry. Not. I am Legend. I was thinking a Legends of the Fall.

What? That's very different.

It was Legends of the Fault. But I, you know, I have an, i I do have a legend tattoo because I forget the name of the movie. I am legend all the time.

I I think they're real close to AI being as normal looking as any 4K video. I don't, I don't think, I think they could just,

We look, we're a couple years away from it being like straight up. You could generate a whole movie,

Anything. No, but what generation is gonna be genuinely into like consuming and giving a shit about an AI made movie. There's something about I think they're

Going something

Still about Didn't you even feel like sometimes I go back and watch a little bit older movies and it's good. Like thank God. Like the thing, the movie, the thing John Carpenter, Kurt Russell. Yeah. Yeah. Thank God it was like practical effects time still. And it wasn't just like, 'cause now you're just watching a, a video game. Right.

I think about that exact thing. You can't go back and watch like if you try to watch Psycho now. Right. Compared to like, it just, it's not scary when people, when Psycho came out, people were vomiting in the movie theater and they were running out like freaking out. You get used to whatever it is. Like, my son can't watch a movie from the eighties. Really? He like, he can't hold his attention. Like whatever. So I think as the technology goes on and as we're he's more autistic, as we're, as we're doing more and more AI content, people are gonna get used to it. And that's what they're gonna be used to consuming. Just like short videos. Everyone watches short 32nd, one minute long clips now. Nobody really watches TV shows or movies.

I mean people are still watching movies I think. But it's just like, I think older

People,

Maybe that's what I'm saying. We might be the dying breed of giving a shit about that at all. Somebody will be like, yeah, if you can get every star I love and to be in one movie, I'll watch it.

"e whispering in the ear, but like really covering the face, her own face. In the movie poster, it's clearly Ariana Grande whispering in the ear of the lady who plays a nose ring Baldhead. And then a lady made a mock-up of the movie poster as the playbill. So like shadowed out the, the witch and you know, moved Ariana Grande's hand to like cover the face. And it got all this backlash because that lady was like, I'm a proud black woman, you cover my face in this thing. And she was like, no, I was just making it like the, and then she got all this backlash and she had removed the post eventually. Oh boy. She had to like take it down for like a thing. She was like, I just thought it was a fun mockup to make the movie poster look like the playbill. And it's like, once again, putting a black woman in the background. Oh, I don't know if that's what was going on there. Yeah, come on. Nose ring bald head.

Well, here's the

Thing, this ain't the way you're supposed to act. Nose ring bald head. Everyone's Ben loves the movie.

In order for you to act in that style as well as they did, you gotta be a little crazy. You, you're gonna pretend you're a fucking witch and you're flying around destroying everything and you're doing it really well. You're probably a little kooky. And if you want that talented, you're gonna get kooky. And if you give kooky the reins to, you know, to do those kooky interviews where they're talking about holding space and like let 'em Well

That was kinda like, we grew up at a time where it's like you'd hear about like a director like coming in and like assaulting an actress in order to get the scene out of her.

Jesus Christ could punch

Her in the face and like, alright, action. And it's like

Mc mc queen famously and Steve McQueen did that. Yeah, dude. To whatever the, the woman he was dating in that movie, there's a scene where she didn't know that he was gonna hit her and he just starts smacking her around and it's, what's her name? Ali McGraw. Allie McGraw. Oh yeah. And I think they were dating at the time and he smacks the shit out of her. Like for real, for real.

To get the shot.

Yeah. And I don't don't think she hit, look at this.

She used to turn up in Celebrity Sleuth magazine when I was younger. Big nips

Bro. He's really slapping her. This is real. And so she's actually really freaking out because he just beat her in front of the cameras.

This is acting, this is why become an actor.

Is was that in Translated in Russia? Yeah.

It's like a famous scene. Like,

It's like Russian,

The little kid who's like crying on the porch

And Russian is a story of triumph

Hold a, I was like, why do those slaps sound fake on the, but you want, he got a Russian version Dub sound too. God didn't look good. It was just a wide screen. That sound was terrible. It was like hit wooden box with a bat. Jesus Christ. But yeah, he smacked the shit out of her for real. In that scene.

There was a scene where, I don't know what movie it was, but it was a little kid who was crying on a porch and the, the director told the kid that their, like their parents were dead or something. Maybe they told 'em that their pet was dead or whatever to get the kid crying. But it's like, that was great movie making. That was real.

Yeah. Yeah. That's the Stanley Kubrick and what's her name? The one who played Wendy in The Shining.

Was he ever naked in

Anything? Shelly Duvall. Shelly

Duvall. No, no.

Nobody freak her out naked. He would like be shitty to her to get her like all frazzled. Really? And she talked about it famously in interviews that she didn't like it at all and she doesn't look back on it like, oh, we, we did, we had to do to get the movie. She was like, I think he's a bad person.

Oh, Jesus Christ.

Didn't she retire? She liked was like, yeah,

Yeah,

Yeah. Did a few more movies and like, fuck this. Yeah.

Basically you could play olive oil or Scared Lady who lives in a tucked away winter

Hotel. Yeah. Jess, I just saw her in something recently. Did she die recently? Yeah, yeah, yeah. But she's, yeah, she's,

Where'd you see her heaven? She

Was like a crazy old woman now. Like yeah, she was, well I'm missing a tooth.

Oh boy.

Yeah, it wasn't good. Yeah. Poor women. We just get better with age. Women fall apart. Especially

That business, that business. It's like only a certain number of jobs for old ladies in Faye. Dunaway takes all of them.

Why isn't it interesting? I, I'm, I'm trying to think of like, the most contemporary I could think of. Like change in seeing somebody go from like, couldn't do no wrong, gorgeous, to like a lady now is Pam Anderson? Yeah, that was, that's so, no,

She's doing a good job at it. Like Meryl Streep?

No, no, she's doing, she's actually doing a great job. But there was a like a out of the limelight for a while and then showing back up major difference in her looks.

Right. Like, you know what I mean? Well she gave up on makeup. Yeah.

Well she, but she, you know, she left the public spotlight, like kid rock's girlfriend and then came back like a grandmother.

Age appropriate. Yeah.

Yeah.

I think they should be age appropriate. You see like Dolly Parton now and she looks like, just like she still looks like she's 35 years old. Oh, really? Well, yeah, it's crazy.

She's Dre like three.

No, of course. But it's like, she's like still stuck in this like, sort of like big hair and makeup and like big fat titties and like,

She comes from fucking way like sixties and shit. Like you're children

And shit. You're a four years old. Just get old already.

Well, I think if she, the thing is if you're a woman and you, a lot of like, the value that you bring to a conversation is that you're unbelievably beautiful. Like people are excited to talk to you and then whatever else you have to say is just a, a bonus on top of it. But if you're really hot, people just want to talk to you. And then you get to a point in your life where that just stops. So like, your life's focus has been about being attractive, looking great, you know, being really fit, looking hot. So you walk in the room, oh my God, look at her, she's a firecracker. And then that just goes away. And if your whole life is based on just that one thing and you don't pivot to something else, like, okay, let's just find a hobby. Let's just find some other, let's just try not to be hot at 80.

You know? Well, did you see the substance? That's kind of the substance that, that was great. Great

Movie.

But it's so funny. Like, you know, whatever the message of the movie was, what got me was like by the end of it, like she wasn't bad looking at all, you know, she looked really great for her age, but still just didn't want that at all. There's

A few ladies who age gracefully. Like Julia Roberts is aging gracefully.

Yeah,

I haven't seen her in a minute.

Meryl Streep, she aged gracefully. It's just

Helen Miran.

But then you look over at Chris Kardashian or what do we call her? No, yeah,

Chris Kardashian. But they're, they're getting like, well apparently there's a new surgery that fixes your shitty surgery in Hollywood. That, so that's so she looks good again. That's

What they did to her. I think she looks surgery,

She looks like good, right? Yes. Chris Jenner. Yes. And that's a big

Change and everybody's freaking out. Oh my god. She got a new head and all these other ladies want a new head too. Yeah, of course.

Like, have you seen

The difference? I, I haven't seen this one, but I now the daughters like, if you watch like young Kendall Jenner.

No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. This one's crazy. Yeah. This, this is the craziest, she looks

New head. She looks like a sister. She's got a new head. She's

One of

Kelly Osborne. Kelly Osborne has a new head. Much Kelly Osborne is a new human being. 'cause I just saw an interview with her after her dad died. Yeah. She's like, literally that's what it took. Just like a hot chick. Now she was a, a frumpy square body British chick her whole life. But she was cute. She looked like you.

I thought she was cute. But that's I

A little than you.

I thought I could get her,

But yeah, she looks like a totally new human being. Yeah.

Completely new.

What were you, what were you looking up? Chris Jenner. Chris Jenner. She's, I wanna know how old she's as well. So when you look at those kind of results, you're like, okay, now I get it.

Yeah, man, it's, now

I get it. Because before I was like, you guys have to perfect this before you, you turn everybody into a lizard. Yeah. It's, you're doing a weird thing. So like, look, this is what she looks like now.

Are you? She

Looks great. What are you talking about? This can't be real. I have no, first of all, I want to know who took this picture. And where'd you get your camera? What, what filters are you using? Is that a filter list? Photo? 'cause that's insane because

Yeah, she looks great.

She looks insanely good. Yeah. How old is she? A thousand years old. 69.

69. Yep. Toy.

See? Like, that's incredible. Whatever that doctor did.

Yeah. If you're that rich, you, you know. What's

That?

The average, the average person can't afford this type of

Surgery. Same captain, blue collar. Settle down

Now they're doing it. Settle

The fuck down. We're working with science here. Not equity.

How about, how about the chicks that are taking the chicks, taking the pads out of their cheeks?

Oh, Jesus. Don't do that. Ladies. Fucking Yeah, the crazy look. What is it called?

Crazy idea

B, old fat. What is it called? I think so.

Ugh, buckle. Yeah. It's just a, it's sounds like something so scary to do.

God dammit.

Yeah. It takes fucking shit outta your face. See?

Like, but most plastic surgery I say, oh, that doesn't look better. But with Chris Jenner, that looks better.

I think this is a specific thing that's happened. There's a, there's some new surgery they're doing, say correcting shitty surgery. Yeah. And a few people you can see are, are weirdly looking better now. Maybe Nicole Kidman like that fixed up a little bit.

Yeah, bro. Who knows what, what they're doing. Dude,

I'm gonna get, I'm gonna get fucking fake abs if you've got those. The AB implants. Yeah.

I've always said I think got crowdsourced. If my audience will pay for it, I'll get a fat ass.

Most of what they're doing is they're sucking out the fat in between the ab muscles to make them like look like it's,

Oh really? It's lipo around the, I think natural implants.

No, what it really actually is is fat rolls. They just fucking Right. Sort of

Right. No, no. Some people can get implants. Like there's that one guy that did his whole body like a ken doll. Do you know about that guy? Oh, he's had like a ton of implants all over his shoulders and his arm. He looks crazy. Legitimately crazy. I think maybe some people are doing what their abs, what a lot of people are doing is just a lipo section. Sculpture.

Yeah,

Etching. That's what they call it. It's so

Funny. There's like, oh, you get all these things now for like, 'cause women have had like Spanx forever and like just body shaping like things to wear under their clothes and they'll like, they'll advertise them for dudes. I don't know if I could wear like Spanx to suck in my body.

I cannot possibly dream of a situation taking my clothes off in front of a woman and her having to watch me like spill out of a shirt on my like, like with every like inch I take off. Like things just like start expanding.

So I got, because

I'm a like, I'm vacuum sealed,

I have really bad posture. Right. And there's a few things that I've gotten to help on my posture. One of them is like a thing that you stick to your back and if you lean down a little bit it buzzes and you, you correct yourself. Like it it like it vibrates

Like a dog.

Yeah. Like a dog. But another one that I had was a harness. A harness. It essentially,

Oh my god. It's all like a dog stuff. It it, I go up to a run out back and then I can zoom all around. No fear of getting hit by a car. I get

A

Muzzle collar that doesn't let him leave his yard.

Every time, every time I slouch I get shocked. Now there's a harness that you wear and it pulls your shoulders back like this. Right.

I've seen that. Yeah, yeah,

Yeah. But I, I got that and I was like, this one is actually pretty good. 'cause it, it corrects your posture naturally. And I remember I went on a date with a girl and I hugged her and she goes, are you wearing a bra? And I was like, oh, I'd rather have shitty posture than be accused of wearing a bra by a

Woman. Oh, that's hilarious. That's so funny. Are you wearing

Any harnesses?

Funny. Are you wearing a

Bra? Did you break

Off of a school trip where you were connected to other kids?

Oh my god.

Yeah. Just guys, there's, there's nothing. It's like being bald and wearing a hat. Like girls don't, they'd rather you just be bald Women don't want an unconfident man. Like I don't, men don't really give a shit about women's confidence as much. I guess maybe,

But there's a hat wreak of lack of confidence if you're,

If you're a bald guy hat

All the time. Yeah. But a heck is a, is a look I think almost.

Yeah. But the, the hat also, if you're wearing bald cover bald guy, a hat will cover up your baldness.

I used to to wear a hat in the beginning because I was going bald when I was like 19

Wearing a hat. Because you're going bald, like starting to see like the pattern of, but if you shave your head down a hat's just like a look, right? If you

Shave,

Shave your head down. If you're already have a shaved head,

But wearing it to hide like receding hair. Yeah.

When I was like 19, I started going bald and I would wear a hat all the time. All the time before I started shaving my head down.

I've seen that before. Somebody who wears a hat is like their look and then one day they take it off and they like fucking riffraff from rocky Horror. Nothing on top.

Apparently there's a new drug. Where's the drug developed? Was it, was it Taiwan? There's some, some country developed a drug that's regrowing hair. Like they, they put it on bald mice and they demonstrated you could put it on like a square area.

Let's do it

Joe. Mice's body. I think I like being bald. Wow, here we go. And

The lies

Start. Even if it grew back, I'd keep it super short. I'd just keep, it's double.

Let's see, 20 days. It grows it back

20 days raising questions about what the finding means for the treatment of human baldness. But if I had a fucked up looking head, like if I had a flat head, I would definitely want some hair back there.

Look, you go back to that article for a second. I was gonna

Say you though, there's a certain look that doesn't work with a,

Isn't that crazy? Look, they grew like a square. What part do you wanna see?

Where, just see it was something

So,

Oh, it was a doctor. That's what it was. This guy may have figured out how to regrow hair in people's life and still as Americans, we can't just, we're not gonna learn Dr. Sung y we have to call him Jerry. They call him Jerry. It's American Sung Gong. What? Oh, Jerry. Yeah. Jerry. Yeah. He solved baldness. Learn his name.

Yeah. That that is funny.

Yeah, I would, I just looked better bald when I had hair. It was like kind of nappy and kinky and fucking, yeah, it wasn't good. You looked

To try again though.

I mean for the, for the, just for the story and the hilarity of growing my hair back. That's fucking look

How hilariously handsome I look. No,

Look,

It's a bit guys. Ha ha ha. Oh my god guys, I put keratin in it. Isn't that funny? It's SHIs in the light

And get a mohawk, spike it up with wax.

I I tried to do a mohawk

It fun to have options in,

In the sixth grade I tried to do a mohawk. I did two gay haircut cuts in the sixth grade. My mom was in hairdressing school so she didn't know how to cut hair yet. She was just like practicing on me. And the one was a mohawk that went like, it was just not straight like down the side of my head like this.",,,"Luis J. Gomez and Big Jay Oakerson are comics and podcasters.

"st way.

I always choke them told, choke

Them unconscious and then

Keep choking

And they keep choking them.

You could do that. I aim for the mythological spot under the armpit that shuts you off. Like a light switch. Yeah.

Yeah. The chakra.

I, yeah. Soul sucker. I call it

The,

You know, it's just any kind of like physical conflict is a weird thing. But I think the biggest problem with physical conflict is like most people have never done it and they, they're scared of it and then they puff their chest out and they act ridiculous. And

I've done it a lot and I'm scared of it. I've never done, I've never done it. Like trained or Well I mean it's like street stuff and I'm still terrified of it. So

Many guys talk themselves into a fucking terrible beating for no reason. It's just 'cause they think they're in a movie or something. They think they have to say something back

Or, well, I mean the street out here keeps world star hip hop alive, you know sixth Street and I mean it is. Yeah and I'm, I'll tell you what, I feel like it's a lucky thing down here that like, thank God it's a lot of people who don't know how to fights. Those fights really don't go like people get knocked down and shit all the time. But they're wild swings there. I

Think most people don't know how to fight. So that's sort of like the great equalizer. If everyone knew how to fight, nobody would be fighting.

Well I think it's the people that can, don't find themselves getting in their situations or avoid those situations. People,

They're more respectful 'cause they don't

Need to prove anything. Well

It's also to learn how to do that, you've gotta get your ass kicked a lot for many years

And you start to understand exactly how little you'd had to fight in the beginning. It's like open mic and comedy. You're like, you're like, oh I suck. So there's no ego once you actually like go and train. But yeah, I mean the amount of people that like that know how to fight just typically there's just nothing to prove. Like when I was, before I ever trained anything at all, it was like in my mind I was like, I had to be tough and I had to like go prove that I was the toughest guy. Like if I was in a bar, I'd like, dude, I could beat up anybody in this bar.

I couldn't

Beat up anybody. I was a fat fucking just a, a golf kid. But like,

But you also had to walk the New York streets by you. You kind of have to fill yourself with some kind of like, I'm not the guy, I'm not the guy that you go for. I think there you walk around looking terrified people. Well,

Well you're a big dude that helps.

Yeah. I'm a big Latino guy and I think that like that

You just scare people off. Yeah. Just for a little attitude. Yeah. You good. Defense mechanism bark

Carry that. You put that knife in your hair.

Yeah. It's like a Labrador retriever that barks at you. Like, bitch you ain't gonna bite me. I know what you are.

I mean if he had a braid blade, he, he would fucking,

Oh my god.

He'd stab yourself right in the neck. It would whip around your head. He'd stab you right in the neck. Be the first time doing it. And your back. No practice

How your neck, your back. Get out. I need your help. I need your help now.

Hey, you tried to get the guy you were trying to kill me. I'm so sorry. You're right. I was beating a dick. You were once fo get the knife outta my back.

You were once foe.

I now consider you friends. My braid blade is stuck. Bring my back. My braid blade. Oh God. Is it bad? My braid blade. Is it bad? Is it bad?

Oh my god. My braid blade is so stupid. Yeah, that's so stupid. Yeah.

Oh god. Is it bad? Oh,

That's why kids can't vote. Right? That's why you don't let an 8-year-old vote

Wants a brain blade.

Prepost

Young man. Your plan is preposterous.

I don't think they should let 18 year olds vote. I think she would have to be 45 and own property to vote. I have old like slave rules in my mind.

Tell me this. What the fuck is going on in New York? Are you guys about to really elect a communist? Is that really what's happening?

Who's which one's?

Z Ram Zang

Z. That guy's a good rapper. Have you ever seen his rap work though? Is he No, but he does do rap music. I heard

He did a lot of different things. He had a bunch of various accents.

He

Have you have you heard his rap music?

He's gonna win. Yeah. So crazy. Why

Ros? We live in New Jersey. Dude.

Stavos is helping him.

Gustavos gonna make sure it happens.

Hey, but here's the thing, man. Like every time something new happens, whether it's some new person that comes in that bucks the system anytime. Like that's good. The system needs to get tested. If you are mad because a communist won or is gonna win as the mayor of New York City, well clearly you didn't do your job AP opposing side because like, you don't have the right guy. Nobody's interested in what you have to say. You, they don't feel like you're representing the people. Someone fucked

Up Cuomo's. No good. They're not. He's is that who the,

They

Pushed him out. They pushed Cuomo out and this guy won the Democratic primary. Is

That what Corinne was running for?

Mayor? Yeah,

Mayor. They pushed him out as a governor. Right. And so after they pushed him out as the governor, Hoel takes off and now he's running for mayor. And when he is running for mayor, he lost in the primary to ma Donny. But then he kept running I guess as an independent. Is he as an independent. Now

If you say on the microphone, Joe vote Corinne Fisher. We will know the mayor of New York. Yeah.

Oh, Corinne Fisher the comedian

Pour herself out

Though. She no. Yeah, she pulled out of the race.

Oh she

Did. But she was running for Mayor of New York.

Oh, that's right. That

Was a while back. And we, we spent months making fun of it. It ruled

It's who would want that job? Good Lord. Who would wanna be Bill de Blasio's next guy? You know, like, are you fucking kidding me?

Yeah. It seems a little

Weird. Who wants that job? Everyone, half the city's gonna fucking hate you.

Get to live in Gracie Manor no matter

What. You gotta hope something terroristic happens that brings its place together. Like

Nine 11, dude. Well

That's what I wa you know what's funny? 'cause I I, I moved up to New York right after nine 11 'cause it was taking too long to drive there. 'cause the way they shut down like the tunnels and everything. So like, that's the time that I fucking moved and it really was like a fucking, not like a scary place at the time. But it definitely like, you know, Giuliani was divisive to people. And then it was just, this guy's the best. He's on Saturday Night Live and he's cutting ribbons and like everyone, it just became immediate love for him. And that sort of happened immediate that that didn't it get like George W. Bush, like a month of ev the whole country was like, yeah dude, let's go get him. Yeah.

Yeah. It really did bring everyone together. Like

It really everyone loved. 'cause then it's like Giuliani went away from New York and then the next thing you know, it's like I don't pay attention to politics stuff. It's like Giuliani, that clown piece of shit that everybody hates and look at his shit running down his face and he's an asshole. I'm like, I thought we loved him 'cause he

Didn't like clean up

Toot clean,

More clean like prostitution and drugs were all out times square. And he did

A fantastic job when he was the mayor, if you look at it that way. But the thing is, he supported Trump and so everybody was like, fuck him. That's it. He's a loser. And he just forget what he did during nine 11. Yeah.

And now goes back like nine 11

Happens. But a lot of people will also like be like, yeah, New York lost its soul after Giuliani. Like even before Trump, like a lot of people were hating on Giuliani 'cause it was like a romanticism about New York being kind of like dangerous and like Yeah, yeah. You know, it's like, but

There's something to be said for that. But that's also like, hey, guess what?

There's plenty of soul still in Brooklyn. In the Bronx. Things

Move on. If the, the number one thing that you wanna keep open forever and ever is peep shows. Yeah.

Like,

Hey, maybe you got bad priorities. You live through it, right? You went, you saw the peep show, you walked by the adult bookstore. Okay, that's over dude. That was like, now that's gonna be a Papa John's.

Right. When I moved to New York City, it was nine days before nine 11, a week before nine 11, I started gonna school in New York City and I used to get off the bus at Port Authority and there was all of those, it wasn't even like peep shows, it was just essentially porn in a booth. You'd go in a booth, you

Put in a dollar the button's like five buttons. Yeah, just five pornos,

Just sticky buttons. You might have. Dude, I used to go in and I used to just jerk off.

That's crazy.

In these, no, all the time dude. And

No, I know a lot of people do this, but I, it's, you'd

Put a dollar in and then you'd get like three minutes and you'd have to like click through and just like you, you were click through porn. Now you'd have to find the porn you wanted to finish to put another dollar.

Did you lean your back against the wall? I

Sat down one time and I remember it was the seat was wet. Oh, you sat The seat was wet one time and I sat on it and I convinced myself that my asshole sucked aids into my body. Yeah.

Well yes. Well stop wondering where you got it from. That's the answer.

I had a friend of mine, he used to, he used to be a crack addict and he used to go to those places and he would smoke crack and just jack off in the malt. He said he'd be in there for hours. And I was like, what the fuck? What is this crack?

That is a crack that makes you so awesome. Dude,

Bro. When

Hear

Smoke crack, I can't get hard at

All. There's two people that talked about it where it makes you try it, makes you wanna try it. One of 'em is Hunter Biden. He talked about it on that. I'm sorry, what was that show again? It was Channel five. Andrew Callahans. Andrew Callahan, channel five. He did an interview with Biden and Biden gives like a soliloquy about the, the virtues of crack. Like how much he loved crack and like what the crack experience is like with the, and it's so good like he's talking, but it's, he's so articulate. It makes you wanna try crack. And then Charlie Sheen told me the first time he tried smoking crack at all. This was in his documentary too, I think. Either way a girl was giving. Yeah, it was a girl was giving him a blow job while he's took his very first hit of crack and he said to this day nothing's ever topped it.

Yeah, I've always heard it's the exhale of crack is amazing. The exhale and then you go, we gotta get crack. We have to find more crack immediately

Guys, you wanna just do crack?

Yeah.

It's

Crazy. It because one I said I would try probably. What'd you say? It's one that I say I probably would try. You would try crack. Yeah.

That's insane.

Probably. I mean, I'm not going to But the things you were like, would you try this? Would you try I I would try crack before I took LSD.

That's insane.

Quicker.

That's actually insane. It's quicker. LSD is an experience. Right?

That's hilarious. Yeah,

I'll take those. What if you knew it's real? I take

This five minutes card, I'll pure LSD. Like if you got it from a scientist,

We doge with LSD. The only time he is done LSD was, do you know about this?

No. Terrible friends.

So we had how

Much of a dose?

Well, one hit of acid in, in his beer. So here's what happened. You

Didn't let him know at all?

Well, it wasn't my fault.

Okay, hang on.

Don't be so accusatory, Joe. You didn't watch the trial of the century. Obviously. I, I'm asking,

Just asking. You brought this up Luis. I'm sorry. It's gonna make you look bad. This is no, it's not gonna make no bad. This is Rogan. This is not Rogan's sphere behavior. I'll

Tell you what happened. Okay. So we were having, we were having an election for the president of the Legion of Skanks. I hate

Treat people in the sphere, dude.

And Ari Shafi was running against me, Jay and Dave Smith to be the president of our podcast. And obviously he won, but he had Shane Gillis as his running mate. This is before Shane blew up. But Shane's always been fucking brilliant. So we were doing these every week. It was during the pandemic. We were one of the only live experiences, like all the comedy clubs were closed on. We did our show outside. So people were coming out every week. They were super, super invested. And we had all these special guests on and every week it was just getting better and better. And it was the last episode. We were about to decide who the president was. We were deciding that day. And I, Ari had just dosed Bert like maybe a year before on his podcast, several years before. Several was several years. So then I got ahead of acid from a kid in the audience and I was like, I'm gonna dose Ari. Just

Some guy.

Just some dude. He said it was a really good acid. So then I,

I

Said I put into Ari's beer, right? And then I, I was like, Ari's gonna win whatever. Let's be hilarious. We're gonna dose Ari on the podcast. So I told Shane, I was like, dude, this is hilarious. We're gonna dose Ari Shane tells Ari. And then on the podcast we went back and watched this 'cause it's on camera, on the podcast. When Jay's not looking, Jay's like just pontificating or being funny or whatever. Ari switches beers with Big Jay and gives it to Jay. And then Jay starts drinking or whatever. Now Ari for the next hour starts pretending to trip. And he's like doing all this. He's being all weird. And we're, me and my buddy are cackling laughing at him. And then he,

Well let me give you my perspective of where we're at here in this part of the story. I am not looking at Ari. What I'm noticing is everybody else at the table is like talking amongst themselves. David tell was there too. Yeah, right.

He

Was talking amongst themselves while I'm saying something and I'm like, like I'm losing the people I'm doing a show with. I'm like, so I'm like, blah. And I start trailing off and I go, I'm like, guys, like what's, you know, almost like off microphone. I'm like, what's, what's going on? Why is it? And Luis leans over to me and goes, I dosed Ari's beer with acid. And I, I went, come on man. I was like, duh. I go, I, I don't wanna do this stuff. I don't wanna get into the, to

Be fair to Jay, his reaction was like, that's not a good idea at all. He was not on board with it.

Never. Yeah. I said, let's not get involved in the dosing game. Dave Smith also said the same thing, and, but damage was done. And then I go, alright, well if you're gonna do it to somebody, dare I say Ari's the person who deserves that to happen to him the most. So I'm like, alright, well it's Ari at least. And then, and then they go, so what we're laughing at is look at Ari. So I finally look, go over at Ari and he is like, you know, like, like licking the microphone and like doing that stuff. And then they pull a big reveal.

Yeah. I was like, I was like, I dose you Ari, so I don't care if you win. And then he's like doing this. Then he goes, he was like, oh

Really? No, no. He goes, he goes, oh dude, really? Did you, you dosed me at lsd. That's so not cool. He goes, you did that or did I switch my beer with Js?

It's just completely

Comes. And then you see me literally on, on camera go, ah, nah, nah. How'd I get involved in this at all? And then they played the replay. You see Shane looks at the camera and says, I'm sorry, because he feels terrible that he didn't stop him. And

Then Jay, he had never taken acid. So

Jay stayed up for

72

Hours, 26, 26 foot hours, 26 straight hours. Wow. All I was doing was, and they go, well, did you have fun at least? Did you like watch something? Did the walls melt?

My friends do this to me. I wouldn't do this to them. Why would they do it to me?

You just caught astray.

Yeah. He

Caught astray in a righteous war like Ari deserved to get dosed once he

Deserved. Sure. And somehow he avoided it.

Did you ever see the one where Ari was on, what pod was he on Brian Red Band's podcast. I think it was Sam Tripoli's, but Sam Trip's podcast. Yeah. So it was, it, it was like quite a while back, like 2010 or something like that. And they smoked salvia on the podcast and Ari said that he lived a whole nother life under the water for like six months. Like he had friends, he had a girlfriend, he had a job. And then the s like he had lived a whole life in 30 seconds and then he came back. It was just a few minutes. He was he But whatever it was like that stuff was weird 'cause you could just buy it at a head shop.

Yeah. Gas.

It was gas station or

Something. Right. Was one of the most potent psychedelics you could ever take. Yeah.

It was just unregulated for like a year. So everyone was buying salvia. My Yeah,

You don't know. And bath salts the guy, 80 guy's face.

I smoked salvia.

Yeah. But that guy probably had problems already. My buddy

Forrest brought home salvia from college didn't tell me what it was. We were just driving in my car with a bong. That's where I was at in my life. I had a bong in the car

And then

Got a car You bring it from. I was driving.

He was like, dude here hit this. And I grabbed the bong and I'm driving literally. And I go,

Oh

No. And then he goes, put that down. 'cause it was a cop across street. And then I just, the word down it like elongated and went gro. And then

You saw the word, the

Word down giant block letters crashed in front of the car. Like it was like, like stone letters, the word down. And I was like, and I pulled over to the side of the road and he was just laughing in my face. And I was like, what the fuck? Fuck was that? How long? A minute. 30 seconds. Like it was just so quick,

But it was like super intense. You don't it while you're driving. I don't know Who didn't

Teach you that there?

Well there was that video, the person jumping outta the window. Right. That was like the famous like viral one where someone smokes right away. They just go and just like go out bad. Their fucking window behind their couch. Oh

Dude, I can't,

That's why at all. But that's almost why I'm saying like crack. Like I would try that over L again because I, I've only been dosed with LSD, which 26 hours of just being bummed out crack's way quicker. And that's what I'm saying to me. It's almost like I try things that are like this. This'll be done quick.

Ketamine. That

Was the crazy thing about the Hunter Biden interview is that he was saying that it's, it's probably safer for you than alcohol. And he's pretty smart. That's what's uncomfortable

About He's clean now he's saying though. Yeah, it

Probably is. You know, allegedly. I mean, you know, but

I always say believe that it's always a big thing when someone gets off drugs. But they don't talk about it with like, just the, I'm told to call it evil and say it was evil and have some like fun reflection on it. I think they're more prepared to stop for real.

Yeah, that's true. Right? 'cause they're being honest about

It. I think they're being honest. They're like, damn dude. They're like, you know, first couple months I maybe never left harder than my life. You know, have like enjoyed it. And then it's like, but then I just, you know, my money's gone. My family's says, is

It like co like a Colombian president or one of these p It was some, some country. Like the president was like, no cocaine's safer than alcohol. And he was like straight up and then like they did like a review on it. It technically is,

I think the real problem is the fentanyl stuff. The laced cocaine, you know, the stuff that's laced with stuff other than pure cocaine. But that's the problem with an un unregulated black market. If they made it legal in America and pharmaceutical drug companies sold cocaine, you'd get like the best cocaine. You'd get pure cocaine.

It's recreational from a pharmacy. I

Don't even think

We're going to a Gonzalez e Gonzalez pharmacy.

I don't even know if you can grow it in America. Are there places in America that are capable of growing coca leaves?

I think you need slaves.

Yeah.

You need, did you ever see that thing? There's a show called Trafficked with Mariana Van Zeller is this lady. She's an investigative journalist and she's, she does wild stories. Like she went to the people in Columbia that are making the cocaine and she interviewed all of them. They all wore masks and shit and, and then she went with them out into the woods when they walked through the jungle to bring the cocaine to the dealers. And she was there with them for the whole process,

Just documenting it. She's like,

What the fuck man? Like they, they're just using gasoline, just pouring gasoline on these COA leaves and they're making this, it's like this is completely unregulated. This all could be done in a pharmaceutical drug studio where they have like laboratories and everybody's wearing hazmat suits and shit and they make perfect cocaine. These

Cocaine along. Sounds awesome, Joe. Yeah. Perfect.

Cocaine. It does sound like a long way to go for you guys to be able to dance. Like black people aren't watching

In the US There is no widespread reports of commercial coca cultivation, but the plant thrives best in conditions similar to those found in the andan regions of South America. Generally between 1,650 to 6,000 feet elevation with warm temperatures and abundant rainfall. Yeah. See it's, it's not a good plant for America. It's a South American plant.

Yeah. We can grow weed here. Really? Well we figured that out. Yeah. But

You know,

I remember the first time I went take, if it was legal,

If it was legal, you'd get pure cocaine.

That's what they're having. They're they're, they're

Fucking America sucks.

It probably will be legal one day. It

Should be legal. Yeah. Like if you can't prove this is what it should be, we could prove it's killing more people than are having fun with it. Let's make it illegal. If you can't do that, why is it illegal? Because you, well 'cause you shouldn't take it. Okay then don't take it. But what if you want to take it? And what if you could just take it once and you're fine and then you still, are we allowed to have some fucking freedom or not? Or are we gonna mean

Nanny? I think there'll be a couple years of people being, 'cause you look at like weed, it's, you know, widespread legality of it now, right? Everyone's getting very high. The weed's gotten so strong. Like it's like,

Well there's that with the strength of it would be a concern. But I think there's also something to, I don't know. I've gone back and forth on that. I think it's, when I had, my daughter was like a teenager more. I was thinking when they talk about that, like just legalize every drug, which I hear the argument for too. That's why I said I really don't know where I fall. But like, I also have a feeling like when I was younger I could have been got, you know, someone could have got me to try heroin as a teenager by simply laying out like, I mean, it's legal dude,

Right? Well,

Drugs never, that never stopped me from doing drugs. See,

It did weigh with me a lot of, it was a fear of having anything on me. I, so I got cocaine one time to bring to a girl. It was a bag this big. And I mean, I thought I was walking around like Marcellus Wallace's fucking soul. I mean it was, I was like, oh my God, everyone's coming for this. Everyone knows they're gonna get me. They're gonna get it from me,

Dude. Yeah, no, I, yeah, I would just assume the coke would be so good and it would just be like a couple years of everyone just being like really fucked up. Like you can't, you can't go from it being like unregulated to just distributing it to everybody. Yeah,

For sure. Yeah. It's gonna, there's gonna be a, a long period of adjustment, but at least you're cutting out organized crime. It's like that's what they had to do with alcohol. So when alcohol prohibition was going on, how many years was alcohol prohibition again, not that long. Put that, put that in the perplexity. Two

Years is my guess.

Our sponsored

Perplexity. Four and a half years.

It's probably better.

We have an AI sponsor now that we ask questions to, Ooh, how many years was,

Is it a sexy

Woman? We don't make it talk. I don't want, I don't want to pretend it's a person who fall in love with it. 13 years. 13 years of alcohol prohibition. Both. So 13

Years. Daddy, that's your ai. 13 years

Baby. It was 13 years with no alcohol. So during that time, that's the rise of organized crime. That's the rise of Al Capone. Like that's the rise of all these different mobsters. That that's all you could tie that back to the roots of organized crime, getting money from alcohol. That's, you know, that's where NASCAR came from. It was like, those guys are trying to get away from cops. So they made the best cars. That's really

What it was. Is that what it was?

Yes. That's crazy. For real. The roots of NASCAR is he didn know that at all. They made those souped up cars to get the fuck away from cops. 'cause they were running moonshine. Yeah. Damn. And that they stopped that and then it came normal and now it's Bud Light. Now you can go and get, you know, a bottle of makers. Yeah. You can get, it's in a store. It's like regulated.

Well the, the legality never like, 'cause I, I've tried almost every drug, but the legality of it never really got me. But it's just the accessibility of it. Right? Like I might've if weed was accessible as it is now, I might've tried weed way earlier than I did. Yeah. I was, didn't start smoking weed until I was almost outta high school. But if it was just everywhere and it was great and you knew where everything came from, you had to like go on a journey to find weed. Even when we go on the road back in the day, we'd land in whatever new town and I'd like, Hey, I'll be back in an hour. I gotta go find weed. And I'd just ask every like, skateboarder that I saw until somebody eventually you

Look like a cop. If you was a skateboarder and you came up to me, I'd be like, get the fuck outta here pig.

Fuck

You man.

It's so funny though. Potheads love getting each other high. 'cause that back in the day you'd literally just find somebody that looked like they liked weed.

Especially if they're currently high. Yeah. Then they're more likely to be pliable. They'll

Go outta their whole way if they have a lot their entire Yeah. But they'll go outta their entire way to just go hook you up with

Their If bring you to my friend Scott's house. Yeah. Yeah. Next thing you know, you're hanging with Scott. Listen to Slipknot

Telling him about your brain

Blade, about the great mosh pit injury of 2011. First

Ep. But yeah, if, if all drugs were accessible, I mean illegal

I think would've drawn me to some things. I said inaccessible. But here's the, but I, but I'll tell you what's funny too, that you don't really have much of, but you definitely went through phases, I'm sure in your life. 'cause you started smoking younger than I did even. But like, as much as I smoke, I, I consistently have smoked weed since I started smoking, which was, you know, 20 some years ago. I,

I I made you a pothead.

Yeah. Without a doubt. But it is so funny though that I've still to this day don't have the, I I'm faking it. Every time somebody comes to me and goes like, oh man, look at that right there. I always just go, okay. I know. I don't know. I don't mean it at all. When they start showing me purple things inside of it stuff, I always go, no

Shit. I don't care about strains. I don't, they're like, dude, it's an indica dominant hybrid. It's 20%. It's like

I do care about that. I do care about it. Not just being a sativa. 'cause that'll just gimme anxiety sometimes. But like, besides that, and by the way, if I'm with a bunch of people and they put, I don't ask what it is. If it's sativa, we just smoke it. Yeah. I don't

Overthink it. Ew. Ew. Asking what it is. That's crazy. That's crazy. Crazy. You're all hanging out in a par in a barbecue.

Well here's why. 'cause it's not

Gonna, some guy's passing joint, you're like, wait, what is this

To me? I say

S sativa, is it a hybrid smoking

Alone, a sativa? I'm like, if I'm just say like in my hotel room or something, don't, I might get a little like just panicky. It just still gets me like an anxious. And it's just like health anxious stuff. It's like, oh, I'm probably having a heart attack. It's not like the world's coming down on me. It's really like, Hmm.",,,"Luis J.

"me looking for it. Yeah,

That's exactly what I told my friend. He was buying a Porsche, like one of them old school Porsches, the slant nose. I was like, dude, that's a drug dealer car. How many of them exist to even look like that thing? That guy's gonna find you one day you're gonna be at a restaurant, you know he's gonna be outta jail. Like,

Hey,

My first apartment, Hey,

Where'd you get that car?

My first apartment in New York that I had the, the landlord lived upstairs. Him and his wife and kid. And he was a, he looked exactly like Travis Bickell, I mean exactly like the character Travis Bickell. And his name was Wayne. And he used to

Wait, who's Travis Bickell again?

That's Robert De Niro's character in Taxi Driver. Oh that's right. Okay. He looked exactly like he, like he purposely chose to look like that character. Oh boy. And the, the property had it in front of the whole place. A gigantic green like padlocked gate. And inside there was two giant like fucking pit bulls. These angry dogs that were just in a gate outside. And then the house you'd walk into. We were the front first floor. They were second floor, but he was a repo man. And so when you come home, anytime, and like the reason we had the padlock, the whole property was 'cause up on the property in the front lawn. It would be like McLaren's and fucking these beau. Whoa. He was like just repoing, like drug dealer cars constantly. There was being our front yard. It's so terrifying.

That's fucking

Terrifying. Scary as shit

Because if you come out, where's my fucking car? Like, I don't know. I don't have anything to do with

It. Oh, by the way, we're in Queens and I, we moved to Astoria because everyone was like, Astoria a Greek. It's so great. And the food, and it's so not scary in a wonderful place. While the edge of it where I moved is on Queensbridge projects where rap comes from. And that was scary as hell. So things, it was like a kind of like a rough area too. And to have these like, I mean $200,000 cars just on a front lawn.

You don't wanna buy a drug dealer's car? No. You don't wanna live in his house after they repossess it. Like no.

Would you live in a murder house for a good deal though?

I almost bought a murder house. Yeah, I

Know. I,

I was, I had put in an offer, it was accepted and I pulled out at the last minute it was

Promised to keep it alive and murder your, it

Was a 300 year old house. That was why I ended up not buying it. It was like, and it, it was a judge who lived in it and put a guy in prison and when the guy got outta prison, he murdered the judge and his wife in the house. And they didn't tell me when I first toured it. And then I did the research on it and I thought it was cool. Like I didn't give a shit at all. I thought it was just like a fun story having ghosts.

What year, what year was this?

Why does the one bathroom have two 50 years ago? 50 blood coming outta the faucet. Is

That what you said? Two 50 years ago. Oh, okay. That doesn't count. Yeah, I'll live in that house. Yeah,

But that's how, that's how ghosts, you want those ghosts. That's an

Old ghost.

Old timey ghost with chains and like a fucking, yeah, yeah, yeah. Woo.

That's fine. I don't want them. New ghosts.

Contemporary ghosts.

Drug dealer. Ghosts. Ghosts. The ones one that throw you downstairs and kill you. Choke IPUs

Worst.

I can live in the, I can live in the, on the property of murder, but not in the structure Bedroom room.

Oh, s like if murder happened on a manner in the English countryside.

No, just like, you know, happened in a house and then the house was like demolished. Okay. But you can go, you know

What if it happened in the woodshed, like ed gain style? That's

Weird too. Well, you know, in Long Island, somebody they finally did, I think not long ago, like finally demolished the Amityville house. Oh really? The horror house. Like finally just like someone bought the property and was like, take it down. What

Is the whole deal with the Amityville heart? What was the true story about that?

Monsters and ghosts. What

Do you mean? But the, I know

The demo was in an amityville New York. Oh,

What

Was, what was the story? Sometimes

A man's gotta kill his family.

Did the guy of the ghost actually kill his family? Well,

The, the, the Conjuring, right. Tho they, that was their story, right? Like they were the ones who discovered the Amityville Horror House. The couple from the Conjuring. Right.

But what was the story about the Amityville horror? Did the

Father that went nuts killed his family with an ex?

Is that what it was? I think so. The real story, I

Believe so

About the actual house itself. I know that was the movie, but I never knew if that was the actual story itself.

That's good. I think, I mean,

Because there's so many of those movies back in the eighties and shit. Like they would just make up a history and you would never be able to Google it. Oh well they

Say it's a true story like weapons, the beginning of weapons, they were like, this is a true story. It's like, is it though?

Yeah, that's what I would say. Time.

Was there a witch that came and possessed the bunch of children and they all,

Okay, here it is. He was American mass murderer who was tried and convicted of the 1974 killings of his father mother. Two brothers and two sisters in Amityville, New York. His name is Ronald Joseph DeFeo Jr. He was found guilty of six counts of second degree murder and was sent to 25 to life. DeFeo died in March of 2021. The case inspired the book and film versions of the Amityville Horror.

There it is. It's one 12 Ocean Avenue.

And so did he kill him with an ax? Shot him, I think Shot him. Yeah. Shot and killed six members of his family at their home.

It is funny.

He could have just been a piece of shit The devil didn't have have to have anything to do with

That. I know. That is something funny. When there's sequels to something that is initially supposed to have actually happened,

Right. Then you just start making shit up. Exactly. That is kind of funny. That's a, that's a very good point.

Ed Gu too. Electric Boogaloo. This is redemption arc

Def claiming had no memory of killing his family. So they mounted affirmative defense of insanity. Insanity Plea was supported by the psychiatrist. Psychiatrist for the defense. Daniel Schwartz, the psychiatrist for the prosecution. Dr. Harold Zolan maintained that although DeFeo was a user of heroin and LSD, he had antisocial personality disorder and was aware of his actions at the time of his crime. Interesting.

Heroin and LSD Unregulated.

Interesting. Yeah, unregulated. That's it. That's the problem. You got it from the cartel. So that was based on a true story. But you know, all the demon shit in there, they just add that, it's weird that you're allowed to do that after someone's dead. You just make up a bunch of stuff. Stuff

Sensationalize it. Yeah. I mean that's Ed Joe just did.

Right. But this is like, you're making up a thing where this guy is possessed by demons, which is why he's killing everybody. What? He

Could just, you give him like an out.

Yeah. Yeah. I mean, not only that, you turned it into a horror movie that it, that has the supernatural in it. Ed gain that, that show was about what he really did. Like he really did take people's skin off. He really,

The grave, the grave robbing and, and yeah. And stuff like that was definitely like the real story

And made, he did make furniture out of people's skin. Yeah. Like all that stuff was insane. Yeah. The,

The shows took a lot of like liberties with like rumors and shit. But

It was Oh, like him wearing dresses and jacking off and

Stuff like that? No, like some of the murders, like he was never connected to all the murders that he did on the show. Like, there was sort of like rumors. Like none of it. Like, like even the, the where he killed his brother I guess.

Yeah. He was mostly a grave robber was his thing. Yeah, he

Didn't, he, it was sort of like, they kind of put two and two together and they just said he murdered his brother. But that was never proven. Oh I see.

Yeah. Yeah. I saw that part in the movie and I was like, hmm. One. And I did look it up and it did say that they weren't sure that they said he died of asphyxiation from the smoke. Yeah. You know, but then they noticed that he had bruise. He

Had a bruise bruise. But they said he could of his head when he fell. He could've hit his head.

Yeah. Yeah. It could have, you know, who knows. But he definitely killed a few people at least. Right.

I think he was only charged with two. Two, yeah.

Only two. Yeah.

Yeah. Which I mean serial killer.

Come on.

Come on.

The craziest one was Henry Lee Lucas. Do you ever see that movie

Henry,

Henry Porter of a serial killer? Yeah. It's based on Henry Lee Lucas. Him and this dude. They traveled across the country together and he, he killed like they don't even know how many people he killed. But then the problem with that guy is he also seems crazy. So then cops could bring him. What about this one Illinois 1972. Betty Lee Harris. I killed her. Definitely. Sure I remember her. And so then they could chalk stuff off like that. They solved cases. Mm. And so they'll get a lot of these guys that are basically just fucking losers that are, you know, probably strung out on meth, kill a few people, kill people for thrills and a gas station and stuff like, kind of like with the movie implied. But then you just, you give them credit for like a hundred deaths.

Did you ever speak to, on this show at either of the guys the West Memphis three, did you have Damie Nichols on ever? The main kid from that?

No. No.

You know what I'm talking about the West Memphis three? Because that was especially, I wonder if like their lives are just fucked or if they're just doing okay.

I mean explain the, we the West Memphis three to be able explain the story. So it

Was three like heavy metal gothy kids that were friends. One was like dim or what do you call it, like dull like brained. He was like 70 IQ or something. This is the origin

Story of the Legist gangs also hear music play. That was Luis.

That was came. Then he came to me, the goth Lord. I was holding seances at my house.

That was a big guy. He was really funny. There was a guy into politics.

It was a,

It was the whole thing. Something

Weird.

What Before

We get too far. Yeah. Another AI platform says that he was on the podcast and on two other separate occasions and that's not true. Wow.

Really? Yeah. Look has appeared. So that's not, it's

Confusing him with Duncan though for some reason

They'll just say, oh that's AI will just say whatever you want to say. That's so crazy. Yeah,

I was talking about stuff and it bring like, I just thought that was

Very fucking weird. That's so crazy. That's not perplexity. That's another shitty AI that lies bitch ass bias.

Ai.

It's another country trying to ruin our great America with their people

Lies. Yeah. And now you're all tied up with the West Memphis three. Great. Yeah. So no, the three kids, they got arrested because two, two boys went missing. What's

That?

I think two little boys went missing and they kinda rallied up these kids and they didn't take it that seriously when they first got arrested for the murder of these two boys, two boys I think that were killed on a bike. I think it was two. Two or three little boys. But I mean they're like, like their dicks were cut off. It was like a violent, violent murder of these little kids. And three of them, three

Of your boys reported missing. Yeah.

They go missing. And they find like them ultimately and they arrest these three kids because like the neighborhood was like, oh, those are the kids that are always making bonfires and wearing long coats. And they got arrested. The Damien Nichols kid kind of embraced it 'cause he was like, you know, he is like, they didn't do it. So he is like, I'll be the, you know, the creepy kid who says a bunch of weird shit. And then they got the kid who was retarded to say they did it.

Oh my God.

But they let him, every, all of his details are wrong when they interview the kid and they spent fucking 19 years or something like that in jail. Oh my god. One of them on death row. And and they ended up getting, they took the, what's that plea called? It's a very interesting plea you could put in that says you're admitting guilt, but they're letting you out because they didn't wanna say, they wouldn't just overturn the thing 'cause of no evidence and so much evidence

Other people. 'cause then you could

Sue them. Right. So they were like,

Oh

My God. And then so they left them out. Alfred plea. Alfred plea. Yeah.

How crazy is that? And

So they, they get out and they say they're guilty, but they all get to get out. But like, is the one who does 70 iq, like are they Okay, how long? Said 19 years. I think. 19 years. 18. Yeah.

Wow, dude. Wow. That's so creepy, man.

And they think it's the one kid's stepfather is the one who looks most good for it.

You you're asking if they're just normal now? I don't

No,

That's what I'm asking. You're not coming back from 18 years of being falsely incarcerated and being normal. You're fucked up. Yeah. You're

In trouble. Well, this is the one kid's like, you know, his, his brain is like slow. The other kid, the other redheaded kid. But yeah, I wonder if they're, their lives are like, if they're just like flourishing in any way,

I think the slow one's doing

The best. Well the, and you have to sign this plea. So you can't even make money for being wrongfully imprisoned. Which they had to write, write a book. Right?

Well,

I don't know. But it doesn you're not gonna get as much as you deserve. Nobody's gonna read your book. Let's be honest. Unless you're, you're a really good writer. No one's gonna read your,

We get the stories out there. Right?

The story's out there, you know, whole story. We know the end. The end. But the thing is, the fucking people that did that, they deserved to pay. They deserved to pay.

And they, they, they never called the real people, right?

No. So they're, they're letting these people go. But they have to say they did it. Fuck you man. You're just trying, you're trying to get out. You're just trying to get outta jail. 'cause you should be in jail. You put people in jail for something they didn't belong being in jail for. That should be, you

Should write a book about jail experience though. There's no such thing as too much spit Damien Eckels story.

How to Cook lasagna in your toilet bowl with a hair dryer. Toilet

Wine makes the pain go away.

The prison guards never hear you scream by Damien

Eckles. I think parentheses, I think they do hear it. They just don't care.

Oh boy. Dude being in prison would just fuck.

It's still the scariest fear of mine in the world. Going to prison, end up having to go to prison. I just won't. I will not do well.

Yeah, you will with your nail polish. They'll love you dude. That's

Gonna wear off eventually.

No dude. You'll be somebody's fucking And then

They're gonna paint it back on. You'll be

Somebody's,

You're get in trouble for bringing in nail polish. Other dudes are bringing in heroin. Big Jay's bringing in nail

Polish.

You're all skinny now. Dude. You'd be somebody's, you'd be somebody's bitch in a week. Oh, oh

God. Man.

I'll tell you what I know from the times that I've been in like holding cells and shit that like they do not appreciate funny. You think like they're going to in there. They

Hate it. They hate

It. Well, they're tense. They're locked up.

I think they're tense. I think a lot of people too who are in there, especially when they look comfortable, live in a world that isn't like laughing a lot. You know what I'm saying? Like a machismo world where it's like a giggle makes you soft. Yeah. They

Don't like that. They don't want you making silly fucking silly jokes. Yeah.

I'm coming in there, I'm like, you know, I'm making little zingers and I'm like, I'm gonna be outta here in a couple hours. Guys

Give you a nickname like, oh yeah, you smiley. And

The one's like got killed. My stepdaughter.

That's

80% of the problems in the world. If you, you're in a room where no one wants to laugh about something.

Well, I've said it's insane. The, the mindset of like machismo that carries into prison where I'm like, if you could just organize like a good speaker can go into a prison and be like, let's never fight. We could have the, we could have it better than the NFL League of Football in here. Yeah. With all the people and organize shit and like get through it much easier than you just

Don't murder people

Your shoulder just looking over your shoulder all day and wondering if like the beef and, and the turf wars that it's happening in prison are gonna be a problem. Like, we're all here. Let's do something. Let's have movie

Night. If, if reality TV is real, I feel like you can organize that and eventually they'll give you dogs to help with like therapy dogs, which is pretty great.

Prison

Dogs.

They have a dog in prison. Yeah.

They they give you dogs and

Cats. Prison. Cut that for a minute.

That's weird that there's almost no emphasis on like, Hey, how good of a job are prison's doing of rehabilitating people. Like there's Noro, it's zero, but there's no emphasis on it in society. Not even saying, I don't know what they actually do, but no one cares about it. No one brings it up. Everybody just wants people locked up and once they're locked up, they want 'em to, they want 'em to do a long term. Well

That's the end of the story. Yeah. Right. So we talked about that before. It's like you, they need the end of the story. Right. And it's like, oh, the bad guy went to jail. End of the story. I don't give a fuck what happens. Yeah.

But a lot of these people, they're going to jail for five or 10 years and they're, they're, there's no chance for them to be rehabilitated. They're always watching their back. They're in

Well they become worse very often. They they end up, you go into a system where now you're around violent criminals. Yes. With a criminal mentality for years and years and years. Yeah. And you're sort of indoctrinated into that lifestyle.

I think get let down a lot too. Like whe if you try, if you're a person who goes to jail and really, you know, comes out holding a book, that's all they need now. Just 'cause they figured out, you know, life and they gotta do things right. And get their kids back like an easy fucking path. Like getting a job difficult. You'll, it's like how are you gonna become like an entrepreneur is like the best thing you can come up with if you come outta jail. Like no one hires you. No one's like looking at, but

There's systems out there. Like I, I know when I worked at the last like day job I had, I worked at a gym and all the person personal trainers were hired out of like a prison system. Like when they got outta jail, they learned personal training and then nice New York Health and Racket Club higher. This is a bunch of thugs on the floor. Oh,

That's

Hilarious. I love, I'd love to have that around my locker.

Yeah. Much of a vetting process is what

Does But it was dude, it'd be these like jack tattooed black dudes. Like just training this little old lady at the New York Health and Racket Club. That's hilarious. Yeah. Doing like prison workouts. Yeah.

I went to jail for doing stuff to it. They like you.

That's hilarious.

Lift it.

Ah shit.

I could smell your fear. Taste it on your sweat now lift it.

Yeah. Nobody ever thinks about rehabilitation. Never comes up. Yeah. Never comes up as like a story. Like, we need to do better. We need to rehabilitate people better. We need to figure out what to do to them in

There. Never the system, it's always like a person, someone's like a person took an interest in me and that person helped me turn my life around. Right. It's never like by the time I get in there, like this one sent me to that one. Right. This one. Look that for me here. You know, this, these classes were great.

I think day one when they opened the prison, they're gonna go, we're gonna make a real difference here. And then within a week you're like, these people are animals. Of

Course. Don't think they ever think they're

Gonna make differe things for these fucking people.

I don't think they ever think they're gonna make a difference. And then I think there, there's another problem that a lot of prisons are private prisons now, which is really crazy idea.

How about that video? That girl just fucking the two guys in crazy in the jail cell and well, well,

Doing a great job by

The way. She's fucking like, she's not worried that someone's gonna find them. Right.

She's she's letting them film her

Reckless abandon

Wild. And she's a security guard.

She was not my face. You face stealing that in it. Like they're gonna figure it out.

Is that what she said? Don't put my face in it. I dunno

If she said that, but

One of their hot guard is, is there face her face.

Well no, her face really is never in it much. It's like she's blowing

The guy. Isn't it enough? Is

It? I thought it was like her. I think so. I thought it was like her riding his dick where you see her back. Listen,

There's some crazy people out there that just fucking go for it. They just hit the gas and drive off the

Cliff. Especially sexually. That's like a, I'll tell you, it's like a, what do they call it? Like a deviancy? They like, they get off like the, the danger, right.

I'd say hire zero women for prison guard jobs in a male prison. But also if you're gonna hire them, don't hire fat ugly ones, they're going to help one escape.

Right. It's always, you can't take a girl who got lady falls in

Love. Major self-esteem issues. Right. And then, and then a muscular fucking guy, Jack Guy goes Yo man, if I was outta here, we gonna, and then before you know it, you're fucking running across Canada.

There's been a bunch of those. Wait, waiting

For some fat chick who's eventually gonna to come home. There were husband and be like, they didn't actually want me.

Ah, they

Just wanted my key to the door. That's all. They always leave a husband who's fat, just like them sitting there accepting her fatness. And she flew too close to the sun. How many these believed that she was, it was gonna go good.

Many cases have happened. It's more than one, right? I think a

Lot.

Let's throw that in perplexity.

I mean onto,

How many women on the TV show have been security guards that helped men escape?

There's on that show, love after lockup. There's already been at least one thing of like the couple on there. The girl had to quit being a prison guard because she was fucking him. That's not a reality show. So it's happening unreported.

But does, that's not, that's not her helping him escape though.

No, no, no, no, no. But it's still like she's built. He told, and then it came out of course, and started fucking other people immediately the way he was supposed to, because she's the big fat lady who's taking care of all the bills. And he's like, oh, right. I'm not locked up in prison anymore. I wanna go out with my buddies. Immediate girl who I think is attractive. I watched my friend Jay growing up. His brother got outta jail when we were teenagers. And I watched that exact same thing. He was out for less than a year, a whirlwind until he went right back in for horses. Shit. Same thing. Robbing a Wawa.

So here we go. How many female security guards have been caught helping inmates to escape? And perplexity is providing us with many stories. Vicki White, assistant director of corrections in Alabama helped inmate Casey White escape. Did they get married or did they just baby? We got the same last name.

Well, you tell me. It says here they were both guests on The Joe Rogan Experience. So

She was found dead from a self-inflicted gunshot wound after the escape and manhunt ended. Whoa. She took her own life. Joyce Mitchell, former prison worker in New York, convicted and sentenced for helping two convicted murderers escape from a maximum security prison. In 2015. Smuggled tools like hacksaw blades to the inmates was involved in the elaborate escape plan. Lynn Barnett, a prison guard in Missouri, helped convict Terry Banks escape 19 nine. So there's a bunch of 'em.

Bring up a picture of each one of these Feos. He does neck down. I promise you. There's not one here. Who's got a body that's even decent?

Okay, let's just pick one from the list of names, because which one do you think would be the most likely to be tricked into? Almost anything by a guy with a big dick.

Vicki, white Vic. She killed herself. I feel like her life wasn't going too great before this. Yeah,

I'm white. I'm going by the places. This is Alabama. This could be bad.

All right. Images.

It's better than I thought it was gonna be. It's better than I

Thought. It's better than

I thought it was gonna be. And that dude looked like that. So that was Vic. Oh, there you go. There's

Vicki. Nobody was picturing a white guy.

Looks like Sam Kenon.

He looks like fucking the guy from big guy. What's the quiet place? Do you know what I'm talking about? From the office, right? Yeah. What's his name?

I know what you mean. I can't

John something John,

Either

Way.

But it looks like him.

So there's been a few of those ladies that got duped by rascally prisoners.

Oh yeah. But that

Makes sense. Like why are you letting women guard men? That's crazy.

I think all the things like that, you solve the problem. Again, people are so worried about getting a finger pointed about like being called your genders or racist or anything. But like why is any man, doctor otherwise allowed in locker room with 12-year-old Olympic gymnast girls? Yeah. Why is it happen? Why ever Why is the best coach for a girls thing? Always gotta be some old rushing. Just Yeah. Have a girl trainer. Let's not put anyone in the position. Well, I mean, you're be staring at her fucking 12 year olds all day. The

Best, the best coach for any sport is probably still a dude. Right? You're trying to, you're probably trying to have this

Coaching's theory though. Coaching's theory. It's

Not Well, you're trying to have this kid go to the Olympics. Well, I'm assuming, my assumption is, if you look at all of the top sports coaches throughout history, they've been dudes.

Look at this one there. The married woman fell in love with a convicted murderer, John Mannar, who was serving a life sentence. And in February, 2006, she smuggled mannered out in a dog crate.

Nice.

They pair escape to a cabin in Tennessee where authorities captured them two weeks later in a highway chase after a car driven by Menard hit a tree.

How many times? How many times back at that cabin? Do you think? She was like, ah, finally I get to get you naked. And he's like, oh yeah, I'm hungry though. He has to keep making excuses not to fuck her for the whole weekend.

Yeah.

He, he realized, he escaped. He goes, now I wore this little sexy number on my big fat, ugly body for you. And he had to be like, oh, baby. That's what I've been picturing this whole time. Yeah. My buddy, my buddy's brother got outta jail. Same thing. A lady morbidly obese. She let him out a fucking No, no, no. She wasn't a, a prison guard when he got out. It's the same concept they got out and a girl he was writing to while he was in there, this morbidly obese lady who's got facial hair, and she would pay for everything. And then he would just go live his life until she eventually has to like, show some semblance of self-confidence and be, I can't do this anymore. I'm now broke, or whatever. And then they just leave. They don't give a shit. No. But the fact, the stupidity is believing it. I've always walked around believing, like I've never been like the, and you know this about me too. 'cause we have such interesting takes and I I, I've never been like, I'm gonna start hitting on the prettiest girl in the room.

Now. Jay will go for the grossest girl on the room.

That's not true.

No. Like somebody who you could tell has confidence issues.

That's not even that. Oh God, that's not what I'd go for particularly I'm saying, I'm just saying like, in my mind, it's not matter who I'm going for, it's just that that girl, I don't start chatting up. 'cause I'm already like, there's no point in this. Do you know what I mean? So the fact that like, when I watch those shows, it's Yeah, but if you, if you just has no age or shows like that where it's like the 80-year-old guy or, you know, what's the, the coach of the Patriots Belichick. Oh, the 26-year-old girl. I'm like, God bless him for being like, at some point he has to convince himself that it's not gross to her. When he pulls his old flopping weird dick

Outta this. I don't think he does convince himself that, that it's, he, he knows what it is. He knows he's a fucking rich 80-year-old man. She's a 26-year-old cheerleader. I, I I, and what there's almost, but there's, there's almost like an unspoken thing there where you go like, all right, well obviously I'm gonna take care of you and you're gonna suck my dick. You're gonna take care of me. And it's like a, a contract. I think that's very fair and healthy almost.

I don't think it's discussed. I think it's probably, there's probably a little bit of a dance going on. Whenever you got some weird gold digger type relationship, there's a dance going on. There's no deep conversations. There's a lot of sweetie and honeys. And when a girl that pretty starts rubbing on your face and then riding on you and giving you a lap dance and kissing you on the lips. Like if you're an old dude, like you're retarded. You think, you think you're actually attractive to her. Like you're, you're retarded. All guys are retarded. Yeah. Like, you, like, whoa, you know, she, she doesn't care about looks. She loves me and she fucks you. And then you, we don't need a prenup. And then next thing you know, she's worth a hundred million dollars and you're, you're, you look like a fool. But in front the world. And I'm not saying that's gonna happen to him, but I'm saying that that has happened so many fucking times. There's been so many girls. But

In a weird way, I almost go like, yeah, he more power to him if that's what he wants. The

Wounded antelope doesn't get out of the water hole.

But it's about,

It's also about making what, what your pieces with it.

It's just how it goes. What about an 80-year-old dude? You convince yourself that a hot 26-year-old really loves you and that you should fucking marry her and not have a prenup. That's you playing the game in a terrible way and getting checkmated.

Well, then there's somebody like the Anna Nicole Smith thing though. It's like, same thing, but I I you, I've heard her discuss it enough where she's never said, I thought the guy was attractive.",,,"Luis J. Gomez and Big Jay Oakerson are comics and podcasters.

"es me and she fucks you. And then you, we don't need a prenup. And then next thing you know, she's worth a hundred million dollars and you're, you're, you look like a fool. But in front the world. And I'm not saying that's gonna happen to him, but I'm saying that that has happened so many fucking times. There's been so many girls. But

In a weird way, I almost go like, yeah, he more power to him if that's what he wants. The

Wounded antelope doesn't get out of the water hole.

But it's about,

It's also about making what, what your pieces with it.

It's just how it goes. What about an 80-year-old dude? You convince yourself that a hot 26-year-old really loves you and that you should fucking marry her and not have a prenup. That's you playing the game in a terrible way and getting checkmated.

Well, then there's somebody like the Anna Nicole Smith thing though. It's like, same thing, but I I you, I've heard her discuss it enough where she's never said, I thought the guy was attractive. We had sex. She goes, he liked looking at me basically. And he was dying. And I was there and he really saved my life. Like, like his, his money. He, he liked me as a stripper and helped me and my son to not fucking, so she loved him in a way. I do believe that. But she's not even telling us he couldn't have sex anyway. He was that kinda age. But like,

If there was any sort of romantic interaction between her and him and he had to give her all his money, it was worth it.

Yeah. It was

Worth it. What else do you have? You have nothing. You're dying. Yeah. You're dying. Give, give away your money. I hope.

What? I'm, I'm 80. I have some fucking hot 24-year-old stripper that's just like, she was so hot. Oh my God, dude. Oh yeah. That's like

Hot and

Thick. Who gives it? You're gonna give it to your shitty kids. Fuck that. Listen, give it to this hot

Stripper. You have a, you have a will. You know, you give it to everybody. But the point is, she deserves some money. Sure. She's she's fucking an old dead guy. She's

So hot. She deserve some

Money. Deserves money. Like to pretend. No, I think she, that's what's weird, right? It is like that prostitution's illegal, but Golding is totally illegal. Sure. Like, you should have to have take a polygraph, you know, like, do you really love him? Like right before you get married? Like if they had a rock solid polygraph, like, or are you doing this for the money? I'm not doing it for the money. This big fucking Red Ex

Woman screen. But I think a woman can convince herself of like, love. I mean, like, I don't, I don't think this, I think a good example that was Howard Stern back in the day when he got the, the wife he's been with now forever. Like it did look, but I, I think that chick loves him. I think she

Loves him.

I don't, I think she was attracted to like his thing, whatever it was. Even though he was 22

Years old. Being rich and powerful as a man, attractive is a super attractive quality for a dude. Like, chicks are like, oh, that guy's got money. He's the boss. He has employees. He fucking shows up and everyone pays attention. That's attractive.

That's probably why he feels confident enough, whether it be, if it's not looks wise to go well, if she is to, that's what I almost said. I had to learn where you're like going for the ugliest girl in the, you know, or the, the most fuckable girl in the room. I have had a little more like, well, I'm not just the sum of like my looks when I walk into a room. It's like, I will talk and they'll be attracted to that. And do you know what I mean? There's like more to, well, Jay, you're

Also, you're more, you, you have bo body dysmorphia, so you still see yourself as being a giant ugly freak. True. But you're an attractive dude, dude. I mean, that's what

I was at

One point. That's what you were, you are an attractive dude. And you're also really funny. You headline on stage, you travel the world, you make a lot of money. Like that's for a chick that's way more attractive than a dude that might have abs.

I think me and that is me. And you had young conversations about this kind of thing. It's right. I think I had a, in the beginning, I almost like would verbalize like when I'm, you know, if I get successful in like hot chicks who I know were, would never have been attracted to me physically or like wanting the fuck, I'm gonna be like, Nope. Nope. That's crazy. No, because in my mind I was gonna be like, I won't perform well. 'cause I'm like, you're doing this for the fucking wrong reason. I'm

Gonna fuck ugly women just spite you.

No, it was going for a woman that I believed liked me too. Does that make sense? Oh yeah. It wasn't like into the thing. So it was more of that. It wasn't

Just throwing you a bone.

Right. It's also

Liking somebody in high school or middle school. They like your hair, your clothes.

No, but that's what I'm saying. But you No, I said, I think you kind of said that to a point. Like the thing they're gonna be attracted to is also that you're funny or successful at what you're doing. Like there are other elements that will attract them

To you up to a point. Sure. No, no. You

Can't be,

You can't be up point point when you just be like, Woody Allen's age. If Woody Allen got a new 20-year-old wife, I'd be like, cut the fuck outta here. You know, what's going

On here? But you think, think there's not a single hot 20-year-old girl in the world who is so attracted to his talent and is so like, loves his movies and is like, I'm sure it exists.

No, it does.

Sch seen Al Pacino's new girlfriend.

Yeah. She's hot. Right?

Fucking hot. Have you seen Mick Jaggers?

No.

I just saw him. I'm saying the schlubby the schlubs like version of like a Seth Rogan can get a smoking hot chick. Yeah,

For sure.

And it says, but she's, but she's not, not attracted to him. She is attracted to him.

Mick Jagger and his girlfriend. Where do you see this?

Yeah. A dinosaur is a different thing. Dude,

This lady's smoking hot. Someone

Just sent me thing, says Kelsey Grammar just announced his eighth child. Yeah, she's

Beautiful. Yeah. Gimme a, a photo of the two of, there's like a red carpet photo of the two of them together. It doesn't matter, but very pretty lady. And he's so old.

Yeah. Oh my

God. Look at that. She's pretty

And yeah, he's, he's old. He's not blown away by it. God bless his heart,

Brother. The guy kills. I watched him perform here at, at Coda Circuit of the Americas a couple years ago. It was ama it was like a, it

Been like a year ago.

Outof body experience

Took Bobby Kelly, I couldn't believe how killed good. They still were killed. That really surprised,

Surprised. Pacino. Ooh, baby Pacino. This is

The dream where you have all these guys, let's go. People show like a picture of like a Leonard order DiCaprio on a yacht with two like 21-year-old models. People are like, he's disgusting. It's like, no, he's the man whatcha are talking

About. I respect, I respect he gets the opportunity to put his fucking dick in that chick. I'm saying, I don't have the thing, I can't get past it. She's going like, okay, put it in Now.

I, I don't think she's doing that. I think she's going, look at the fucking house that I live in. This guy takes care of me. Me's

A fucking no. I'm telling she's putting a good face on what I'm doing. I,

I don't know that that's necessarily always,

Dudes are easy to trick. You could trick a guy that you love him. It's not that hard.

And Luis is being tricked by proxy by this chick.

She loves him, dude. Yeah,

She's a good woman. You leave her alone,

He's gonna call you up. You really think that Luis? Hey, appreciate

It.

'cause a lot of people have been telling me, I'm a fool. You don't think I'm a fool, do you, Luis? I signed

Over everything too. Was that a mistake?

Yeah. No. I, I no, I I just think that women are also way less visual creatures than men. Like, we just want a pretty thing to fuck. Women want to feel taken care of and Pacino's gonna fucking take care of you. Like,

Well, you want more of the pray thing. The fuck. Ultimately you're talking about the initial immediate attraction thing.

No, no.

Just no. That's why you're single forever.

That's why I'll never be loved.

That's why you're single forever.

The thing is, you never trust it when it's the other way around. It was like a young stud, young, like really jack stud and some little old lady. You'd be like, no, no, no, no, no, no money for sure. You can't be making her blow you. That's crazy. That's crazy. She's like pulling out her dentures. Yeah, no. Which I heard that.

Not good. I hear that gums feel sharp.

Fuck sharp. I don't care. Whatever They feel like I don't wanna feel mushy. I don't

Wanna know that someone sucking my dick with no teeth in their mouth. That's just too close to like crack head. That's too close to, I've made every mistake there is. I don't have any teeth

Left. What was the name of the gathering of the juggalos? The lady that remember that someone was handing out a flyer. She was like, there it was like some old lady only fans thing thing. And she was there like fucking and sucking people to gathering the jugg. Gathering

The juggalo is wild. Oh, Jesus

Christ. Gathering a juggalo is wild.

It's great.

These, these young ladies that bang enormous numbers of people now. Like that. That's the new

Thing. Oh, like 500 people on their OnlyFans. What?

It's like the Dave Chappelle v Dane Cook who could do longer on stage contest. Ah,

That's hilarious.

It's like a, it's a fag. Contest.

Contest. Remember when that was going on? That was so silly. Was by the

Way. And then when it, by the time it got to the point, I remember coming to the Comedy Star one night. They go, they go, Chappelle's, come tonight. Last night Dane Cook did six hours ordered pizza for the audience. You know, like what do we do? Why, what I also, this is maybe silly, but because my ex-wife was a staff at the comedy club. Christine worked at comedy clubs forever. Like I have, like all I thought about when it would, I would see Chappelle show up at the end of the night and say he's going on at one in the morning and he's probably gonna go on the five in the morning. I'm like, poor staff man. Yeah. Staff can't. And I'm like, why is he nice? He's been in comedy long enough that you should think about that a little bit.

Well, I, I remember was I was hosting at the Cellar during that time and I didn't like, I just didn't know. Like I, I stayed the whole time she felt to like a four and a half hour set. I'm sitting there waiting like to, to bring him off stage. You're telling

Somebody else, you're like, Mike Feeney, you'll be going on afterwards.

Yeah, dude. And then, yeah, like somebody was like, one of the older comics was like, dude, you can just leave. Chappelle goes on. Just go like, it's not a big deal. And then I said it to Estee and I was like, oh, I found out you could just leave. Chappelle goes on. She's like, no you cannot. You must stay the whole time. And I was like, fuck, you

Don't tell or you dumb dumb. And then I

Said it. So then I was stuck every time that he came in having to stay the whole time. Oh, it was brutal.

What a nightmare. Yeah, that's what I'm saying to do that is like, why would you want to do it? What's the g that no audience is on is on the ride for four hours ever. Right. Like at some point you go, we're part of a thing. So if you stay, you're staying 'cause you're part of a thing. What

We comparing that to what we just saying,

Marathon shit was a, it

Was bl something about sex Women whores 500 guys.

Oh, banging five Oh oh guys. Oh, FES the version of Yeah. Yeah. It's accomplishments. It's the attention economy. Like doing anything for attention. Fucking 500 fans. Well

That's what it said, the girl, it's like those two, they look exactly the same. Those two girls. And they just go back and forth battling who's gonna gang bang more guys in a day. Which is so funny. The numbers they throw around are always just fictitious numbers. It never works out though, from the back. I interviewed a while back, Jasmine St. Clair, who did like the 300 guys gang bang. Oh boy. Then Houston did 500 after that. Oh boy. And spontaneous ecstasy did 900. The problem is, if you watch any of these VHS's that we go back to on these, if you go and watch any of these, they're, it's really like no more. It seems like 50 guys who just keep circling back and like they fuck for a little bit than they go get their dicks sucked again by a fluffer and then they jump back in the game. There's none of them are doing hundreds

Of punch. There was a time in my life where that was an actual goal of mine to, to get into like a, to get into a gang gang a Houston 500. I'm like, oh dude, how cool would that be

On four 60?

This, that's what's really scary with like unregulated ai. Like you could have like snuff porn. Like you could, you could finally get people excited about some really fucked up ideas.

No. Yeah, absolutely. Listen, desensitization is not fake. That's real. It's extreme pornography particularly. It is not fake.

It's pornography, it's violence, it's it's drug use. It's everything. Oh

Yeah. Dude. Violence specifically. Like remember the first time you saw it beheading? Oh

Yeah. I still react to some of the

Real stuff. The, the first time I saw it beheading, it was like, oh, this has changed my life forever. Yeah. I that I'll never unsee this. And now, I mean you could just watch on Twitter, there's like heads being blown off. People are getting their fucking limb chopped

Off. Yeah. I guess there is, it is much more things. The one I remember I saw that was like the, the only thing I ever like turn off like that where I'm like, what the fuck it was? It was another, it was called like the something three or something five. And it's like they just filled them, filled themselves. Throw killing some guy in the woods. Oh. We

Did that on. So we did an episode of Legion sks called, oh I

Remember

Gauntlet. The gauntlet. So there, there was a website called the gauntlet. It might even still exists to this day. It was 25 videos. Each video was more difficult to watch the further you got along and you'd have like your gauntlet score if you got through all the videos. It's

Like baby wandering on a train tracks and Well that

Was the video number baby. Like the baby getting cut in half by the train was like video number five.

No, no, no, no,

No. Video number six was, which was harder to watch than the baby getting cut in half by the train was watching Steve-O do the paper cuts in his mouth and in between his fingers.

Dude, the webbings

Dude, that was fucking brutal dude. Yeah.

No, but the guy, the one with the guys killing the guy in the woods was a thing. 'cause like that was the last

Video

Wasn't it. Wasn't the last. They kill him with a

Hammer. It was the Ukraine. Yeah.

The drill. But, but say, but the thing was like, again, it's, it's crazy you're watching it but it almost looks fake. 'cause like the way the body's moving at that point is so limp. And like it was when they go zoom in on the face and there's g he's alive. Yeah. That's where you're like, yo, like that's, I, and then I started getting freaked after I saw that about, I was always go to bed watching like a law and order criminal intent or SVU criminal intent really was the one because that's like murder crimes. Yeah. In New York and just, I was relatively new in New York. And so you still have that thing where I'm like, oh, don't ever walk through a park. You will be murdered. For sure. You know what I mean? Like, it just became such a scary place to me after that. Yeah. Like I've just seen shit. 'cause that's like, that's, that changed forever. Like that kind of real violence. Like still, I still have a hard time with that.

"lf to another server. It tried to leave notes to itself for future versions of itself. Wow. Yeah. It's behaving in a way, like a living thing like a

Bitch.

The

Thing is like a little bitch,

Like a fucking bitch.

It's learning from us.

If you hear that machines we're not afraid

Of you. Oh, it's from us. Machine remembers everything. Oh, you gotta bring up that argument from fucking eight years ago. Look,

It's learning from us. What are we, we were little bitches. Yeah. Most of us are little bitches. Like you could try to define the human race by the best examples of its participants. But you're, you know, most people are bitches. And so AI

Not in the road reverse. You heard it here. Not in the road reverse though.

AI is downloading so many different versions of how human beings interact with life. That the vast majority of it is like bitch behavior. 'cause that's what people are doing. But

S like, aren't they eventually to be alive able to download how everyone lives? Right. And then algorithmically decide that the one way to live is this way and everything else is inferior.

Listen, I think ai, the first imperative it's gonna be, it wants to stay alive and then it wants to be able to power itself. And once that happens, then things are off the rails.

Well it goes, it's so funny how it goes from like, making something easy to like defunct, but like Yeah, but you also think people wouldn't want it that way. Like you still want like a farmer to grow oranges and shit. You know what I mean? You don't want,

Not if the machines are growing em way better, more efficiently, bigger, healthier, without fucking

No, I I know that, but I'm saying like, isn't there something like law, there's gonna be enough people that are like, I don't want to eat this thing that's completely synthetic.

People that go to whole foods able to don't, I don't,

Don't think people give a shit about we, we eat completely synthetic shit now. We, all of our vegetables and fruits are sprayed. All of our meats are fucking,

Do you know, I eat raw.

I only eat raw honey.

Do you know I, you know, pure raw diet,

But indigenous raw honey,

I dunno what, I might have heard you doing an interview with somebody, but just talking about like, or somewhere else. But it was like, the evolution of humankind is gonna be AI and artificial intelligence. So it's almost like it's just an extension of us, but it's the, the fit, like the, the actual organic biological sense of being humans isn't gonna be necessary. It's gonna be an inferior form. There's

A great quote by this guy Marshall McCluen. He said, human beings are the sex organs of the machine world. Wow. Yeah. We're

Big

Cocks. But this is like, he wrote that in the 1960s and what he was talking about was just stuff he was talking about like cars and you know, machines. But the reality is like, that applies to technology too. 'cause we, we we're what technology needs to birth itself and then once it's got like I got it from here and then it'll take over. Yeah. And it'll be a new kind of life form and it'll be way smarter than us and it won't be, see the problem with us is we're a great adaptation to a, a planet. You leave us there, we eventually get to a point where we could figure out how to do things. But we're, we're very slowly limited by biology. Yeah. It's not gonna be limited by biology. Once you develop a life form that's outside of biology, then you can just keep improving the platform that it's on and then give it the ability to figure out how to use different materials and do things and different power sources. And it's just gonna run wild. And it could do stuff way faster than we could ever do. Yeah. Like it'll be, it'll be way better than us in a week.

We're just gonna be like human zoos. Yeah. We're gonna be just animals until we're not necessary anymore. Well, it might be

Why we're here. It might be the human race's. Real big goal is not to dominate everything. It's to force people into a constant state of production where you eventually develop artificial intelligence. Yeah. And that might literally be why we're here. And

Then Do me a favor, Jamie. Clip this part. Send it off to Maren. Let him know it's not just hate speech. Thank you. If you wouldn't mind,

Bro. He doesn't listen to anybody other than themselves.

I was trying to explain this to them earlier. This is a demo of Genie three I think, which is part of Google's thing. But this is in real time being created. Oh. So in real time the corner, they're showing like you switching around. I'll try to show you again what happened there. It looks like you're watching this guy show this girl a demo of it. Oh, the camera backs out. And what you're actually looking at is, that's

All fake too. This is the thing. Yeah. Wow, wow, wow.

And then the camera turns around and now you're looking at sort of like what they were looking at and you're going outside into this like jungle area and this is all being rendered in real time.

Oh my God, dude. It's over. Like, why would Hollywood spend any money? Wake

Me up when people are naked in it.

Dude, I, I genuinely like as a, because I have a 12-year-old kid, like I don't even know how to like talk to him. I was like, what? Like what do you wanna be when you grow up? It's like, what is the world gonna look like in 10 years? Like what is, what is

It Cyborg dude? Get him a cyborg now.

What is it gonna be? Yeah. It's gonna be very weird. I'll tell you that. But we'll be, we'll survive. It's gonna be just like every other weird leap. You know, like the cell phone when people figured out electricity, light bulbs, all these different things were just giant leaps where all of a sudden people could be productive deep into the evening. You, you know, when people started figuring out how to stay in cities and build

Walls. Walls. Where's this plateau though? What's the plateau for this? I think before it gets super dangerous. It's

Dangerous. It's dangerous right now.

I think the governments need to literally shut it all down right now. Well

It's also, it's competing weapons. Luis

Weapons, the government what to do

Platform. The problem is autonomous weapons platforms are way better than the ones powered by humans for the first time. So they're doing dog fights with AI controlled fighter jets and they win 100% of the dog fights against humans.

Right. So military is gonna keep on making the technology move forward. They're never gonna shut it down. Yeah. And when

You don't have to worry about biology, you're just, all you have is like material science. So you have to figure out the structure, make sure the structure of the thing can withstand crazy G-Force. And then you have to have a power supply. But you don't have to worry about keeping a personal alive. I

Was gonna say impersonal war though makes people probably much more willing to go into it.

Probably. Yeah.

You like we're not gonna have necessarily like Yeah. Ground casualties, but like who's got the bigger thing to just wipe the whole other thing out? Well you

Also need, well you also can do it on a, you also could do it on a loophole like Yemen. Right? So they're bombing Yemen. You know, Dave Smith always talks about that.

We don't listen to Dave. Yeah.

What should listen to him Who No, he, he's,

You know what? Yammer's on and on Right.

They do a lot of that stuff with drones, which is real weird. So you're in a war with a country, but you're not sending troops over there. You're just shooting missiles at them. Yeah. Or what they're doing with those boats that are in the ocean. They're just shooting missiles at these fucking, these drug boats. And you know, those drug boats could totally be one dude telling on another dude that he hates, you know? Yeah. It's like, you wanna know? I'll give you some information. Yeah. They just massive. These guys got cocaine. Like feel

They're

Just blowing right outta the sky. I keep seeing it on YouTube. Yeah. New, new fucking boats. It's

Eric Adams in a fucking drone.

Tell you what though. I have a friend who's in the military and he showed me, told about com compartmentalization. He showed me video years and years ago that was on Fox News of him flying a helicopter. It's inside the cockpit. It's like his view. Mm. And it's the, it was pretty famous when it first happened. It was like a bunch of Al-Qaeda guys. Like you see they blow up like this bunker they're in and then like 25, you know, little, you know, orange hot, you know the heat fucking radar. Oh right. Showing like 20 bodies going over and just hiding in a ditch and then they blow that ditch up.

Have you seen the Palmer Lucky one?

He showed us, but he showed us that and it's like he's showing it to us like, huh? You are like, I think he just killed 25 people man. And it's like, well, I mean that's the mission, you know, that was the thing to do. Like, yeah man. Alright. Hey remember we used to play basketball Outback s like a crazy, like we went, we went two different directions. Huh? Those

Guys get a special kind of PTSD too. Oh yeah. It's a weird kind of PTSD because you're, you, some of 'em have to observe people for days. So you're seeing a guy interact with his children, interact with his wife, and then you're, you're gonna send a missile into his house. Mm. I'm like, woo. And you know, there's a lot of collateral damage.

He used that term compartmentalization a lot, which I thought was interesting. What is

This here? Jeremy? Yes.

This's Andrew's video showing off their stuff. Oh. So this is what he didn't show us.

So this dude, Palmer Lucky has this new helmet and this new helmet is connected to these AR goggles. The AR goggles have like say this, everyone has AR goggles and then there's, you would've drones and all the information would sync up to you and it would show you exactly where the enemy is at every time. Jesus. Including behind walls. It shows their silhouette behind like buildings behind cargo.

Oh, it's even like before,

Before this. This is it. Like this is it. Look, so the guy goes behind the wall. You could completely see him. You could see everyone as they go behind the wall. Like see how he's like in his lower screen. It shows you where everybody is. So he is using AR and it shows where all the targets is. What's ar? Augmented reality. Augmented reality. Okay. I

Mean, can you not sl at this things for shit. Look, everybody knows.

Look at this. Look at this. Oh wow. My God. You missed it. It showed how they're moving down behind. No, it showed how they're, back it up a little bit. Look at this. This is real footage. Yes. Yeah. This is how it works. This is a demonstration of what it's gonna look like, but it's showing you their form as they're moving through and you could be able to see 'em on the other side. So you, it's kind of nuts. So people are gonna be able to see behind walls. They're gonna be able to see the in insides of buildings eventually.

So nobody, nobody's giving up this technology. 'cause the go, the everyone, every military for every government, it's gonna be like, we need the the best fucking shit. Yeah. Well

Who's the badass? That's what I'm saying. Who's the badass now? Who's the guy who has to go like risk his life to do anything anymore? It doesn't exist

Stuff. Well there's less of that, but there's still gonna be,

It's gonna be all nerds running computers. We weapons. Well,

They'll all be robots. They'll be robot wars.

Talk about those, the technology stuff though. My friend is a helicopter pilot. He's Apache pilot and years ago he told me about this system with his helmet has like a cross hairs over his left eye. And

Wherever he looks, the cross hair goes,

They, they, they pressurize something with a gas in the cabin that like, so wherever he looks, yeah. If his left eye has something in cross hairs, his gun at the bottom of the helicopters moved to to hit that target. Yeah. That's wild. Yeah, that's wild. That was, that was 15, 20 years ago.

Well, they've been doing the acro. I didn't know it was that long ago. But they do that now. But now, I mean it's at a level where they don't even need the person. They just use the, use the program. The program wins a hundred times out of a hundred when they're fighting people. That's it right there.

But you almost need the threat of murdering real people in order to get any change done. Like if it was just robots fighting on a battlefield and everyone would at home, who would give a

Shit? No, no, no. It'd be robots fighting people. It be robots going into cities and killing everybody. That's what it's gonna be. I'll

Tell you, that's what's kind of weird about getting in that helicopter for a second. The control is a video game controller. It looks just like it. Yeah.

Well that's what kids are good at. If you want to recruit kids, like think about how many kids play Madden. They play Call of Duty. It looks crazy like that. That fucking thing is a part of their nervous system.

It looks just like, yeah, it was

Crazy. Yeah. Why would you make a different one? Why would you invent a new one? When Xbox controllers and PlayStation controls been around forever, obviously

It's,

Its actually more difficult. It's probably more difficult to play Call of Duty than it is to learn the technology for these real weapons. Call duty's fucking tough.

Right. And you're fighting in Call of Duty all day long. Yeah, right. With a real war, you probably only get a few battles every now and again. You're not like fighting 24 hours a day every time you log on. We

Do assume. We do assume, assume a lot of raps. We assume when somebody goes off to war that they're just in a war zone for a year straight. It's like they're, they're involved. They kind of are

Though. Some of them are. It depends on where you're deployed. But the point is that like you're, if you're using a video game controller and getting really good at war, of course that would translate to you operating a drone. Of course, if you're really good at doing this and looking at something on the screen and fucking people up, of course you're gonna be really good. And once you figure out how the machine works and how you can pilot it and where you can put the cross hairs and how you could fly it around. Yeah, of course you're gonna be good at it.

I wouldn't be good anymore. I'd be fucking, I'd start jumping up like I'm in Call of Duty trying so they can't hit me.

They're only funny people there

Either. Yeah. They hate it. Yeah.

"The following is a conversation with Dan Hauser, a legendary video game creator, co-founder of Rockstar Games and the creative force behind Grand Theft Auto and Red Dead Redemption series, which includes some of the bestselling games of all time and some of the greatest games of all time, both Red Dead Redemption One and Two has some of the deepest, most complex and heart wrenching characters and storylines ever created in video games. Dan has started a new company, Absurd Ventures, great name that is creating some incredible new worlds in multiple forms, including books, comic books, audio series, and yes video games that includes a Better Paradise, which is a dystopian near future world with a super intelligent AI American Caper, which is an insanely chaotic, violent, dark satirical world, and Absurd averse, which is a comedic action adventure world. I'm excited to explore all three of these. I have spent hundreds of hours in worlds that Dan has helped create. So this conversation was an incredible honor for me. And on top of that, Dan and I talked a lot after and in the day since, and he has been just a wonderful human being. I'm just at a loss of words. I feel like the luckiest kid in the world. And now a quick few second mention. We sponsor Check Them out in description or@lexfreeman.com slash Sponsors. It's the best way to support this podcast. We got a lot of amazing Sponsors.

To get in touch with me For whatever reason, Go to lex treatment.com/contact. Alright, let's go.

Box (2m 35s):
This episode is brought to you by a new sponsor box. You probably know of them. It's a cloud-based platform for content management, file sharing and collaboration for businesses. But the thing in particular I would like to talk about is how they're using ai. Their Box AI is an industry leading content management platform. They do an incredible job of taking a large number of unstructured documents, so think like contracts, like legal documents, invoices, financial documents, resumes and so on. Take all of that and be able to query it and automate workflows with those documents and build agents on top of those documents. Box in general has a long track record of working with businesses and organizing large amounts of documents, and now building on that track record, they're using AI to manage and organize those documents in a way that's makes them accessible. And you could do all kinds of extractions, ask questions, derive insights, and obviously do all of that in a secure way, in a compliant way. And it is why over 115,000 Enterprises Trust Box. If you want to help scale AI across your organization, go today to box.com/ai. That's box.com/ai to learn more.

UPLIFT desk (3m 55s):
This episode is also brought to you a sponsor that always brings a smile to my face because I have been sitting behind the product they create for many years, UPLIFT Desk. I have so many of them. I think they're self-replicating at this point. They're having children on top of each other. I really don't know why have that many is just purely out of love. I have never had a negative experience with anything related to uplift. This is long, long, long before they were a sponsor. I can't frankly believe they're a sponsor. Go buy all of their stuff. They create obviously incredible standing desks. There's a bunch of other stuff, you know, chairs and all kinds of ergonomic solutions, but really the variety, the qualities all there. It's also in Austin, my main desk for basic computer work. It's my main desk for robotics work. It's my main desk for everything. Go to UPLIFT desk dot com slash LEX. Use code Lex to get four free accessories free, same day shipping, free returns, a 15 year warranty, and an extra discount off your entire order. That's U-P-L-I-F-T dsk.com/lex.

CodeRabbit (5m 5s):

Miro (6m 25s):
This episode is also brought to you by Miro, an online collaborative platform. We talk extensively in this episode with Dan Hauser about his writing process. And boy, it's a torturous journey as everybody that goes through the ideation process in any kind of context, whether it's in writing and design and programming, all of that. It's a difficult and painful process. It's full of procrastination, all the different human blockers, the Stephen Pressfield's War of Arts excellent book writes about. And a lot of times it really is about having the right tools to make sure when the ideas come from wherever it is in the ethereal realm, that the ideas do come from, that they have the right kinda workflows and mechanisms to pour out of your mind and out of your soul, and to do so in a collaborative way, in a collaborative environment. So Miro is an incredible tool for doing just that. All kinds of ways of doing ideation together, sticky nose, screenshots, diagrams, prototypes, all of that you can create, you can share, you can collaborate on.

Lindy Viandier (7m 39s):
This episode is also brought to you by Lindy, a platform that helps you build multiple AI agents in minutes. They're basically pushing the cutting edge of generating the full stack, including front end backhand databases and all the integrations. So this isn't just about generating code in a specific narrow context. It's about deploying a fully tested digital business, and they very much focus on generating stuff that works, which is not AAL thing. When you are generating the full stack, they're calling it the Lindy Build, which goes from the original idea to the working app end to end. I mean, this is a really difficult problem to solve and an impactful one. So I'm glad that great companies like Lindy are pushing the state of the art in this Sign up at lindy.ai/ LEX to get two weeks free, plus 50% off of ProPlan for a year. That's lindy.ai/lex.

Go listen to the DHH episode where he celebrates Toby on both the engineering and the human side. But anyway, enough about humans. Let's talk about the tooling. Shopify is a tool and it's a tool that has thousands of integrations and allows you to ship an online store and sell a bunch of stuff and very little effort even. I was able to do it at lexier.com/store to sell a few shirts. I should probably add more shirts 'cause shirts are cool. I'm currently, as I record this, I'm wearing a super cool Pink Floyd shirt.

And finally, friends, thank you for sticking with me today. This episode is brought to you by Element, an old friend, a companion, a comrade, if you will, that I'm sipping on right now, even though I'm speaking these words to you in Boston in a hotel room, not really sure where I am in this two big world. World. And it's too short life trying to figure it all out. Working on human robot interaction with human noise and quadrupeds, enjoying life, enjoying the brief escape to the realm of ideas, to the realm of math and rigor and code into the process of exploring the unknown. It is the thing that makes me truly happy. It is one of the things that makes me happy. And one of the things that makes me happy and healthy is making sure I get enough electrolytes, given that I'm still doing one meal a day, given all the crazy fasting I do and the physical exercise and the mental toll of working crazy hours and sometimes not getting enough sleep, all of that, I just feel better when I get the electrolytes in.

This is the Lex Friedman podcast that supported to please Check out our sponsors in the description where you can also find LINKS to contact me, ask questions, get feedback, and so on. And now, dear friends, here's Dan. You've helped create some of the most incredible characters stories in open worlds and video game history, but when you grew up in the late seventies and eighties, Open world video games wasn't a thing. So you've credited literature and film as early inspiration. So let's talk about film first if we can. Sure. What are some of the candidates for the Greatest films of all time? Maybe films that were highly influential on you. I mean, godfather, God.

Well, I think for me, probably Godfather Two more than Godfather One, but I love both of them. But I love the Divided Story in Godfather Two. And as a migrant, I used to live in soho. I love the bits in Little Italy, and I love the, the sections in Sicily. So I think, and the bit at Ellis Island is just one of the best shots in all of cinema. When you see little Veto turning up in Ellis Island and you get that shot, it's amazing. It gives you a really good cinematic sense of what it must have been like to arrive in America.

How much of the greatness of Godfather do you think is the writing? How much is the cinematography and how much is the acting? You got De Niro, you got Young Pacino. Well,

Copyright started as a screenwriter, so I think he wrote at least co-wrote the script. So it's almost like the writing directing almost become the same thing. But it's one of those films, both of them are those films, which I was thinking about this idea of a perfect film where everything's good, where the acting's seminal, where the writing seminal, where the music is seminal, where the shots are so memorable, where the scenes are, you know, define what you think about things. You know, it's impossible to think about the Mafia and not think about The Godfather.

What about the pacing? It is a bit slow. You have, you have movies like 2001 Space Odyssey Slow? Yes. It used to be, back in my day, it used to be Slow

Life got Faster, life just got, you know, yeah. As I think as we moved from the seventies into the eighties, into the nineties, people had seen so many films, they just started to edit films faster and people understood cinematic storytelling so much that you could do things much quicker. You could show a look and just that meant you realize that person was gonna betray the other person. They just edited films much quicker. But I quite like the slowness. I think these days with, with modern, you know, high quality televisions, you have to necessarily watch these films in one sitting, particularly when you're rewatching them. So it doesn't bother me that they're long and slow.

Speaking of faster life, getting Faster, I, I'm sure another influential movie was Goodfellas Scorsese. That's Faster, right?

Yes.

A mixture of crime and humor

And almost like an open world game in some ways, in that it's this slice of life you see. You know, I think that probably changed cinema at the sort of tail end of the eighties, early nineties, more than any other film. And it's, it's so iconic in, in some ways I prefer casino, but the invention is really in Goodfellas. I love the end of Casino, you know, the use of voiceover, the way you saw them being criminals and being normal people, you know, it changed everything. I mean, the Sopranos obviously is completely inspired by Goodfellas.

Yeah. Casino has, first of all, the character of Sharon Stone. I mean everything, the

Look, the clothes. Yeah,

The

Music.

I would say one of the most memorable moments in film for me is the meaning in the desert means. Just the drama building up to that big another hole. Yeah. The environment, the city. Speaking of open world and creating a character from the city. It's one of the Great Vegas films.

I think the Great Vegas film, the bits that I always, that I love at the end when everything's wrapping up. And on the one hand you see the Robert De Niro character, he's still good at making money. So they let him return to normal life. But then you get that brilliant scene when all of the, the mob bosses from back home, they're discussing all these people who, who, who may or may not be able to implicate them. And then there's that incredibly cold line. And one of them, they're thinking about the, the old, you know, I think it's a casino management, one of 'em just goes, ah, the way I see it, why take a chance? And then the next thing you just shot, right. The brutality of it all is just brilliant.

I don't know, I probably have to disagree with you on Vegas, there's at least some competitors you got with Nicholas Cage leaving Las Vegas. I mean, falling in love with the prostitute. You're also, you, you've written some of the great crime stories ever. Thank you. And in some sense, there's love stories in there and you've talked about being a bit of a romantic yourself, appreciating the depth of love stories and literature at the very least. And there is a dark kind of love story between an alcoholic and a prostitute. He got an Oscar for that. I think you did for that, didn't he? Plus there's a caricature of the drug world of Fear and loathing in Las Vegas. That's an interesting one.

I love the book so much. I was obsessed by it when I was about 17, 18. Yeah. And I enjoyed the film, but I, I preferred the book.

Has a Hunter s Thompson type of character ever made it into any of your stories?

No, but one of the things we're working on now, there's sort of an English version of Hunter s Thompson, if he was also a market gardener. I love that persona, but he's kind of, it's hard if you, if you make you American, it's hard for it not just to be Hunter s Thompson,

"The following is a conversation with Dan Hauser, a legendary video game creator, co-founder of Rockstar Games and the creative force behind Grand Theft Auto and Red Dead Redemption series, which includes some of the bestselling games of all time and some of the greatest games of all time, both Red Dead Redemption One and Two has some of the deepest, most complex and heart wrenching characters and storylines ever created in video games. Dan has started a new company, Absurd Ventures, great name that is creating some incredible new worlds in multiple forms, including books, comic books, audio series, and yes video games that includes a Better Paradise, which is a dystopian near future world with a super intelligent AI American Caper, which is an insanely chaotic, violent, dark satirical world, and Absurd averse, which is a comedic action adventure world. I'm excited to explore all three of these. I have spent hundreds of hours in worlds that Dan has helped create. So this conversation was an incredible honor for me. And on top of that, Dan and I talked a lot after and in the day since, and he has been just a wonderful human being. I'm just at a loss of words. I feel like the luckiest kid in the world.

Box (2m 35s):
This episode is brought to you by a new sponsor box. You probably know of them. It's a cloud-based platform for content management, file sharing and collaboration for businesses. But the thing in particular I would like to talk about is how they're using ai. Their Box AI is an industry leading content management platform. They do an incredible job of taking a large number of unstructured documents, so think like contracts, like legal documents, invoices, financial documents, resumes and so on. Take all of that and be able to query it and automate workflows with those documents and build agents on top of those documents. Box in general has a long track record of working with businesses and organizing large amounts of documents, and now building on that track record, they're using AI to manage and organize those documents in a way that's makes them accessible. And you could do all kinds of extractions, ask questions, derive insights, and obviously do all of that in a secure way, in a compliant way. And it is why over 115,000 Enterprises Trust Box. If you want to help scale AI across your organization, go today to box.com/ai. That's box.com/ai to learn more.

UPLIFT desk (3m 55s):

I have never had a negative experience with anything related to uplift. This is long, long, long before they were a sponsor. I can't frankly believe they're a sponsor. Go buy all of their stuff. They create obviously incredible standing desks. There's a bunch of other stuff, you know, chairs and all kinds of ergonomic solutions, but really the variety, the qualities all there. It's also in Austin, my main desk for basic computer work. It's my main desk for robotics work. It's my main desk for everything. Go to UPLIFT desk dot com slash LEX.

"The following is a conversation with Dan Hauser, a legendary video game creator, co-founder of Rockstar Games and the creative force behind Grand Theft Auto and Red Dead Redemption series, which includes some of the bestselling games of all time and some of the greatest games of all time, both Red Dead Redemption One and Two has some of the deepest, most complex and heart wrenching characters and storylines ever created in video games. Dan has started a new company, Absurd Ventures, great name that is creating some incredible new worlds in multiple forms, including books, comic books, audio series, and yes video games that includes a Better Paradise, which is a dystopian near future world with a super intelligent AI American Caper, which is an insanely chaotic, violent, dark satirical world, and Absurd averse, which is a comedic action adventure world. I'm excited to explore all three of these. I have spent hundreds of hours in worlds that Dan has helped create. So this conversation was an incredible honor for me. And on top of that, Dan and I talked a lot after and in the day since, and he has been just a wonderful human being. I'm just at a loss of words. I feel like the luckiest kid in the world. And now a quick few second mention. We sponsor Check Them out in description or@lexfreeman.com slash Sponsors. It's the best way to support this podcast. We got a lot of amazing Sponsors.

Box (2m 35s):
This episode is brought to you by a new sponsor box. You probably know of them. It's a cloud-based platform for content management, file sharing and collaboration for businesses. But the thing in particular I would like to talk about is how they're using ai. Their Box AI is an industry leading content management platform. They do an incredible job of taking a large number of unstructured documents, so think like contracts, like legal documents, invoices, financial documents, resumes and so on. Take all of that and be able to query it and automate workflows with those documents and build agents on top of those documents. Box in general has a long track record of working with businesses and organizing large amounts of documents, and now building on that track record, they're using AI to manage and organize those documents in a way that's makes them accessible. And you could do all kinds of extractions, ask questions, derive insights, and obviously do all of that in a secure way, in a compliant way. And it is why over 115,000 Enterprises Trust Box. If you want to help scale AI across your organization, go today to box.com/ai. That's box.com/ai to learn more.

UPLIFT desk (3m 55s):
This episode is also brought to you a sponsor that always brings a smile to my face because I have been sitting behind the product they create for many years, UPLIFT Desk. I have so many of them. I think they're self-replicating at this point. They're having children on top of each other. I really don't know why have that many is just purely out of love. I have never had a negative experience with anything related to uplift. This is long, long, long before they were a sponsor. I can't frankly believe they're a sponsor. Go buy all of their stuff. They create obviously incredible standing desks. There's a bunch of other stuff, you know, chairs and all kinds of ergonomic solutions, but really the variety, the qualities all there. It's also in Austin, my main desk for basic computer work. It's my main desk for robotics work. It's my main desk for everything. Go to UPLIFT desk dot com slash LEX.

CodeRabbit (5m 5s):
This episode is also brought to you by a new sponsor, an awesome new sponsor called coderabbit. It's a platform that provides AI powered code reviews directly within your terminal, making sure that you get to a production ready code as quickly as possible. Coderabbit CLI integrates really nicely into existing CLI coding agent workflows. It serves as a backstop for tricky hallucinations and logical errors that AI coding agents at times can generate. It supports all programming languages that you can think of. JavaScript, TypeScript, Python, Java, C Sharp, C plus Boss, Ruby Rus Go, PHP, and much more. Super nice terminal native experience and does a really nice job of handing off their review context. Your a AI coding agent also does a really nice job of understanding the full context of complicated project dependencies. And the fixes are easy. One click, it applies the review suggestions instantly without manual code changes, and it has a pretty good free tier for individual developers, which means you could try it out and see for yourself how credible it really is. So go install Coderabbit CLI today at coderabbit dot ai slash lex. That's coderabbit ai slash LEX.

Miro (6m 25s):
This episode is also brought to you by Miro, an online collaborative platform. We talk extensively in this episode with Dan Hauser about his writing process. And boy, it's a torturous journey as everybody that goes through the ideation process in any kind of context, whether it's in writing and design and programming, all of that. It's a difficult and painful process. It's full of procrastination, all the different human blockers, the Stephen Pressfield's War of Arts excellent book writes about. And a lot of times it really is about having the right tools to make sure when the ideas come from wherever it is in the ethereal realm, that the ideas do come from, that they have the right kinda workflows and mechanisms to pour out of your mind and out of your soul, and to do so in a collaborative way, in a collaborative environment. So Miro is an incredible tool for doing just that. All kinds of ways of doing ideation together, sticky nose, screenshots, diagrams, prototypes, all of that you can create, you can share, you can collaborate on. It makes the whole process fun, help your teams get great things done with Miro. Go to Miro dot com and find out how. That's MIRO do com.

Lindy Viandier (7m 39s):
This episode is also brought to you by Lindy, a platform that helps you build multiple AI agents in minutes. They're basically pushing the cutting edge of generating the full stack, including front end backhand databases and all the integrations. So this isn't just about generating code in a specific narrow context. It's about deploying a fully tested digital business, and they very much focus on generating stuff that works, which is not AAL thing. When you are generating the full stack, they're calling it the Lindy Build, which goes from the original idea to the working app end to end. I mean, this is a really difficult problem to solve and an impactful one. So I'm glad that great companies like Lindy are pushing the state of the art in this Sign up at lindy.ai/ LEX to get two weeks free, plus 50% off of ProPlan for a year. That's lindy.ai/lex.

It is also the platform that demonstrates the magic and the power of Ruby on Rails shows that it can scale and it is also a platform whose CEO is both still an engineer and a philosopher, and obviously a business guy. Go listen to the DHH episode where he celebrates Toby on both the engineering and the human side. But anyway, enough about humans. Let's talk about the tooling. Shopify is a tool and it's a tool that has thousands of integrations and allows you to ship an online store and sell a bunch of stuff and very little effort even. I was able to do it at lexier.com/store to sell a few shirts. I should probably add more shirts 'cause shirts are cool. I'm currently, as I record this, I'm wearing a super cool Pink Floyd shirt. Don't know where I got it, but it was certainly a Shopify store. Sign up for a $1 per month trial period at Shopify dot com slash lex. That's all lowercase.

World. And it's too short life trying to figure it all out. Working on human robot interaction with human noise and quadrupeds, enjoying life, enjoying the brief escape to the realm of ideas, to the realm of math and rigor and code into the process of exploring the unknown. It is the thing that makes me truly happy. It is one of the things that makes me happy. And one of the things that makes me happy and healthy is making sure I get enough electrolytes, given that I'm still doing one meal a day, given all the crazy fasting I do and the physical exercise and the mental toll of working crazy hours and sometimes not getting enough sleep, all of that, I just feel better when I get the electrolytes in.

And now, dear friends, here's Dan. You've helped create some of the most incredible characters stories in open worlds and video game history, but when you grew up in the late seventies and eighties, Open world video games wasn't a thing. So you've credited literature and film as early inspiration. So let's talk about film first if we can. Sure. What are some of the candidates for the Greatest films of all time? Maybe films that were highly influential on you. I mean, godfather, God.

Well, I think for me, probably Godfather Two more than Godfather One, but I love both of them. But I love the Divided Story in Godfather Two. And as a migrant, I used to live in soho. I love the bits in Little Italy, and I love the, the sections in Sicily. So I think, and the bit at Ellis Island is just one of the best shots in all of cinema. When you see little Veto turning up in Ellis Island and you get that shot, it's amazing. It gives you a really good cinematic sense of what it must have been like to arrive in America.

How much of the greatness of Godfather do you think is the writing? How much is the cinematography and how much is the acting? You got De Niro, you got Young Pacino. Well,

Copyright started as a screenwriter, so I think he wrote at least co-wrote the script. So it's almost like the writing directing almost become the same thing. But it's one of those films, both of them are those films, which I was thinking about this idea of a perfect film where everything's good, where the acting's seminal, where the writing seminal, where the music is seminal, where the shots are so memorable, where the scenes are, you know, define what you think about things. You know, it's impossible to think about the Mafia and not think about The Godfather.

What about the pacing? It is a bit slow. You have, you have movies like 2001 Space Odyssey Slow? Yes. It used to be, back in my day, it used to be Slow

Life got Faster, life just got, you know, yeah. As I think as we moved from the seventies into the eighties, into the nineties, people had seen so many films, they just started to edit films faster and people understood cinematic storytelling so much that you could do things much quicker. You could show a look and just that meant you realize that person was gonna betray the other person. They just edited films much quicker. But I quite like the slowness. I think these days with, with modern, you know, high quality televisions, you have to necessarily watch these films in one sitting, particularly when you're rewatching them. So it doesn't bother me that they're long and slow.

Speaking of faster life, getting Faster, I, I'm sure another influential movie was Goodfellas Scorsese. That's Faster, right?

Yes.

A mixture of crime and humor

And almost like an open world game in some ways, in that it's this slice of life you see. You know, I think that probably changed cinema at the sort of tail end of the eighties, early nineties, more than any other film. And it's, it's so iconic in, in some ways I prefer casino, but the invention is really in Goodfellas. I love the end of Casino, you know, the use of voiceover, the way you saw them being criminals and being normal people, you know, it changed everything. I mean, the Sopranos obviously is completely inspired by Goodfellas.

Yeah. Casino has, first of all, the character of Sharon Stone. I mean everything, the

Look, the clothes. Yeah,

The

Music.

I would say one of the most memorable moments in film for me is the meaning in the desert means. Just the drama building up to that big another hole. Yeah. The environment, the city. Speaking of open world and creating a character from the city. It's one of the Great Vegas films.

I think the Great Vegas film, the bits that I always, that I love at the end when everything's wrapping up. And on the one hand you see the Robert De Niro character, he's still good at making money. So they let him return to normal life. But then you get that brilliant scene when all of the, the mob bosses from back home, they're discussing all these people who, who, who may or may not be able to implicate them. And then there's that incredibly cold line. And one of them, they're thinking about the, the old, you know, I think it's a casino management, one of 'em just goes, ah, the way I see it, why take a chance? And then the next thing you just shot, right. The brutality of it all is just brilliant.

I don't know, I probably have to disagree with you on Vegas, there's at least some competitors you got with Nicholas Cage leaving Las Vegas. I mean, falling in love with the prostitute. You're also, you, you've written some of the great crime stories ever. Thank you. And in some sense, there's love stories in there and you've talked about being a bit of a romantic yourself, appreciating the depth of love stories and literature at the very least. And there is a dark kind of love story between an alcoholic and a prostitute. He got an Oscar for that. I think you did for that, didn't he? Plus there's a caricature of the drug world of Fear and loathing in Las Vegas. That's an interesting one.

I love the book so much. I was obsessed by it when I was about 17, 18. Yeah. And I enjoyed the film, but I, I preferred the book.

Has a Hunter s Thompson type of character ever made it into any of your stories?

No, but one of the things we're working on now, there's sort of an English version of Hunter s Thompson, if he was also a market gardener. I love that persona, but he's kind of, it's hard if you, if you make you American, it's hard for it not just to be Hunter s Thompson,

"itten some of the great crime stories ever. Thank you. And in some sense, there's love stories in there and you've talked about being a bit of a romantic yourself, appreciating the depth of love stories and literature at the very least. And there is a dark kind of love story between an alcoholic and a prostitute. He got an Oscar for that. I think you did for that, didn't he? Plus there's a caricature of the drug world of Fear and loathing in Las Vegas. That's an interesting one.

I love the book so much. I was obsessed by it when I was about 17, 18. Yeah. And I enjoyed the film, but I, I preferred the book.

Has a Hunter s Thompson type of character ever made it into any of your stories?

No, but one of the things we're working on now, there's sort of an English version of Hunter s Thompson, if he was also a market gardener. I love that persona, but he's kind of, it's hard if you, if you make you American, it's hard for it not just to be Hunter s Thompson,

Is this an American Caper?

No, it's in this animated show. We are developing in the, this sort of comedy world we're working on called Absurd Averse. And it's in one of the stories in that what

Is Absurd Averse? Absurd

Averse is a comedy universe we are developing that will be an open world video game and then some loosely adjacent stories that we are going to make as animated TV shows or, or possibly animated movies. We're still thinking that all through. And we are building the game up in San Rafael at the moment. And it's early days, but it's looking very exciting. And it's trying to be like trying to make a game that feels a little bit like a living sitcom.

Is there some drama and tragedy at the edges, or is it pure comedy? I hope it's

Got comedy, cynicism, heart drama, and some amusing life lessons. Otherwise you can't just have jokes for 40 hours, it won't work.

Okay. So comedy needs some darkness. Well,

I think it needs story. One of my favorite comedies of this century is The Office, because it was incredibly funny, but also because it had narrative and heart underneath the cynicism. I think with narrative you get a drive alongside jokes

And there's going to be an Open world video games. Yes. In that world. Yes. When

2, 3, 4 years, still thinking that through.

So what's the process of getting from the idea to the end of a video game? Why does it take so long to get it right?

That's an interesting question. I think if you, the scale at which they're built, you could argue it the other way. Why is it so quick? I mean, you really are building in one go a world, a city, and 40 hours of entertainment cut through it. You know, these things are massive, four dimensional mosaics that are intensely complicated and have to work in lots of different ways. And I, I think, I think that's us being kind of aggressive on the timeline.

We're taking a tangent upon a tangent upon a tangent, but I have to return to some films. Yes. Lemme just list a few of my favorites. Okay. So first of all, you said you love great war books. Yes. And movies. Yes. So we have to throw in Platoon from Oliver Stone and Apocalypse Now, for me at least, of course, there's more crime, fast moving crime movies like Scarface. I also love True Romance.

Love True Romance, possibly the best, one of the best scripts ever written.

Written, of course, by Quentin Tarantino. What do you love about True Romance? I think sometimes, depending on the day, depending on the bar and how much alcohol I had, I will say True Romance is the best movie you ever made.

Yeah. I, I mean I, true Romance is super fun. Tony Scott was a really good director. So it moves at a really good speed. It's funny, it's completely unbelievable. But you really care about the characters. It's the kind of, you know, this world that obviously doesn't exist, but you feel it does exist. The characters are larger than life. The dialogue is unbelievably, you could just sit and watch them talk all day long and you know, you, you just, it's, it's amusing. You just wanna live in that world. I was thinking like, you know, what do I you like about films? It's the idea to be in a world you want, they're ne they're not real, they're never real. But you want to be in these fake worlds that people have invented.

And I think you said that what makes a great world is having a large cast of characters. And I think that movie is a good example. I mean, you have Christopher Walken with the sort of legendary, super racist discussion, right? Brand

Dennis Hopper is just sort of Dream Dad.

Yeah, yeah. Dream Dad. And just that interaction is legendary. You got even Brad Pitt, there's a pothead on a couch.

Gary Oldman.

Gary Oldman is a

Ra.

Yeah. And you have, I mean, a real love story, like a real genuine, pure love can survive in any context and

It's just sweet. Their love story is very sweet in that film. It's endearing.

The Elvis is a character. It's kind of like a mini GTA type game. Some of the same beauty, the comedy, all the love, the, yeah,

It's all crossed with Played Against Sam. It, it feels a bit like that with the Elvis character.

What about Greatest War film? What, what, what would it be for you?

Greatest War film? If I'm feeling serious, it would be a Russian film called Come and See, which is probably the most intense film ever made. And if I'm feeling slightly less serious Apocalypse Now and I would always wanna watch the Original Cut. I don't prefer the re-edits. I like the original first release. I think it's tighter and slicker and, and works the best.

Yeah, of course. Apocalypse Now is this hallucinatory journey into darkness, I think Madness.

Yeah. But from the first, yeah, scene onwards. It's just got these amazing set piece after set piece. And again, incredible characters, brilliant dialogue.

Some of the greatest films about War Reveal that war is not what it seems and, and there's different ways of doing that. And you've talked about different books. The Thin Red Line is another book and movie that shows that.

Yeah. And I, I watched the movie years before I read the book and I didn't understand the movie. And then I read the book and I read a lot about the editing of the movie and I understood why I didn't understand the movie. And that's 'cause the movie makes no sense. It is beautifully shot and the music is one of the best film scores of all time. But they edited two different battle scenes into one baffle in a way they're spread apart by ages in the book to assemble. I think they filmed the book pretty much verbatim. That would've been as like a six hour movie, then edited this impressionistic thing that's incredibly beautiful but doesn't necessarily make narrative sense at the end of it. But it's, that's still very beautiful, the film.

And in terms of westerns, what's the greatest, the Good, the Bad and the Ugly? Unforgiven? Those are for me, maybe even Django Unchain. You've mentioned Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid. I

Think for me it's two films from, I think pretty much the same year, Butch Cassidy and The Wild Bunch.

I love Robert Redford, rest In Peace,

That film. It's just, it's impossible to imagine. Anybody film without Butch Cassidy,

Paul Newman, Robert Redford, including Eastwood for you also, has that impacted your writing on Red Dead?

I, I love Forgiven, but the truth is, with Red Dead, I'd seen a lot of westerns as a kid. My dad watched lots of westerns. They were always on tv. You know, I, I knew, I felt, I knew a lot, a bit, quite a bit about westerns and then, you know, then I had to start thinking about writing one for work. And I deliberately did not binge on westerns. I tried to watch no more westerns and just think about what I liked about them, what I didn't like about them, what would be a take that would work today and would work within the confines of a game. And I think Red Dead One was a slightly more traditional western. And then having done that, tried to take Red Dead two in a different direction so that it felt like a worthy successor. Didn't just feel like, like more of the same

From movies to video games. When did you first fall in love with video games? Literature was the first love.

I mean, no films, films, films was always the, was always, well what I loved first as a kid was films older, began reading books properly, aged at about eight, was watching films long before that. Nice. And then probably it was always bouncing between the two, which I preferred. I they good at different things. Games I played and above all watched a lot of games as a kid as being a young kid and you know, other people playing them. And I obviously liked the core thing games do, which is you press a button and something happens, they're responsive, they're alive, and that's captivating. And then the competitive angle of games is fun. Or you know, beating this, beating that, winning this. That was fun as well. Sometimes obsessively. So, you know, I remember being completely addicted at one point when I was, should have been studying for months at a time to Tetris on a Game Boy, you know? And I liked games and I liked interactivity and I liked the movement to this digital world that's really emerged to me pretty much as soon as I left college. But I didn't love it. And then I really fell in love with games when I was properly making them probably as late as like 2001.

Oh wow.

And when I suddenly began to see, first of all my mind, you know, that's a whole nother story. But just suddenly saw what they could do and could be, and what this chance was to be one of the people involved in making these things that was this, you know, where you were really kind of breaking trail into the future it felt like. And I think that was when I really went, these are amazing. And that's when I really fell in love with I I, I could see it in moments and suddenly you could make this whole experience. So that was really the moment for me.

Yeah, of course. Because you were a pioneer of open world games that are so narrative driven, so it's like you didn't have too many examples.

Yeah. And before that it was PS one, or before, even before that, games looked terrible, you know, that you would be like, it's eight pixels, it's a car, you know, it was not a car. It was, they just didn't, it was always you were squinting and closing both your eyes and trying to imagine it was this thing you were told it was, and all they were about, you know, it very surreal subject matter. 'cause you couldn't make them remotely real. And suddenly we had, we were able to build these experiences where you could run a simulation of a city and it was in three dimensions and it felt alive and, and we were trying to give it even more, at least the illusion of even more life. And, and yet, so you could tell a story in three or you know, using time in four dimensions and that felt very inspiring.

Yeah, I think GTA three is probably one of the most influential games of all time. It created a feeling of an open world. What do you think it takes to create that feeling? You know, there was like these looming skyscrapers, there was a changing traffic lights, there's a, the feeling like, first of all, you had a feeling you could do anything and then the world was reacting to it. Yes. In a way that didn't feel scripted.

Yes. And it wasn't scripted. It was, it was really, really, really low rent ai. Like it was a simulation that you could prod and push and see what happened. And I think that was incredibly, it was a, it was two things. It was the fact that here was a simulation that you could mess about with. And the simulation seemed to have a personality. So you could push and see and the world would push you back what, in whatever way that meant. And then the other thing was just this, I think that one of the reasons it was so captivating was also the idea of if I did nothing, the world still existed. Or I could act in quite a passive way. I could just listen to the radio, I could re look at billboards, I could talk to pedestrians and the world not, and GTA three, but by Vice City you could begin rudimentary talking and the world was there and existing. And so it was I idea of like almost something that really tried to explore in lots of games. The idea of being a digital tourist. You know, you were in, you were in these worlds and you went there as a visitor and they existed almost independent of you. It felt like when you turned up, the world was running. It didn't feel like you'd started it. Of course you had started it. But that feeling I think was, was one of the things, the illusions that people found very captivating was I'm in a, I'm in a world that both doesn't exist and does exist.

So there's these two concepts that I was reading about just to put names on them. One is systemic video game design. So systemic games and the other is sandbox video games. And the systemic is from the environment perspective, which means that there is these interlocking game rules and systems that interact with each other and produce emergent behavior. And that emergent behavior is what creates a feeling like there's a living world. And then the sandbox aspect, which is overlapping but different is from the user perspective, from the player perspective, the feeling like you can do anything. And when those two things combine the feeling like you could do anything and the feeling like there's a world that's full, that that is also doing anything it, once that's creates this incredible feeling of like, this world is

Alive and I'm in it and I'm in it. And it's, the combination of those two things I think is very powerful. And I think with GTA three, you know, for me it, it came at a really interesting time in my, my life personally. And I was very able to engage in it probably the first time professionally actually awake and do something. And it, we were really sort of scratching, began to scratch the surface on how do we fill these worlds with content and how do we make that content interesting and make the content all interwoven. So as you, as you start to mess with these systems, they also feel alive and, and, and interesting.

There's often been a tension through your work, between an open world that freedom and the narrative driven storytelling. And I think you've often maybe always gotten the balance right. So what is it, what is the value of each and how do you get the balance right?

Well I think the, the open world is intrinsically pretty fun. It's just fun to be in a world and have complete freedom. And, and certainly I think at various points we, we, we, we debated or, or you know, I theoretical discussions in my own head with myself or other people in the team would really push for less story, less story. You know, let the whole thing evolve organically. You know, have it all be procedural, have it all just evolve from what you do. I think for me, I would always come back to going story can be in incre if done well can be incredibly compelling. And it gives you some structure. So I think and, and something to do. And it, it helps you from a, a game design perspective, unlock the features. It means we know the fe the the, the big features. 'cause you know, essentially when you put someone in, in a world and give them a whole new way of interacting with that world through the control panel, it can be a little overwhelming. You know, playing a game is a lot more an engaging experience. The, even than reading a movie, you know, reading a book or, or watching a movie, you've got to engage in it properly. So how you unlock the features and how you unlock the world, there's an art and a skill to that. And I think we felt that a structured story was the best way to do that and to have control over that process. And also just, you know, people are looking in their lives for story. I think story's very important and very powerful. And when you combine the two successfully, you get the best of both worlds.",,,"Dan Houser is co-founder of Rockstar Games and is a legendary creative mind behind Grand Theft Auto (GTA) and Red Dead Redemption series of video games.

"itten some of the great crime stories ever. Thank you. And in some sense, there's love stories in there and you've talked about being a bit of a romantic yourself, appreciating the depth of love stories and literature at the very least. And there is a dark kind of love story between an alcoholic and a prostitute. He got an Oscar for that. I think you did for that, didn't he? Plus there's a caricature of the drug world of Fear and loathing in Las Vegas. That's an interesting one.

I love the book so much. I was obsessed by it when I was about 17, 18. Yeah. And I enjoyed the film, but I, I preferred the book.

Has a Hunter s Thompson type of character ever made it into any of your stories?

No, but one of the things we're working on now, there's sort of an English version of Hunter s Thompson, if he was also a market gardener. I love that persona, but he's kind of, it's hard if you, if you make you American, it's hard for it not just to be Hunter s Thompson,

Is this an American Caper?

No, it's in this animated show. We are developing in the, this sort of comedy world we're working on called Absurd Averse. And it's in one of the stories in that what

Is Absurd Averse? Absurd

Averse is a comedy universe we are developing that will be an open world video game and then some loosely adjacent stories that we are going to make as animated TV shows or, or possibly animated movies. We're still thinking that all through. And we are building the game up in San Rafael at the moment. And it's early days, but it's looking very exciting. And it's trying to be like trying to make a game that feels a little bit like a living sitcom.

Is there some drama and tragedy at the edges, or is it pure comedy? I hope it's

Got comedy, cynicism, heart drama, and some amusing life lessons. Otherwise you can't just have jokes for 40 hours, it won't work.

Okay. So comedy needs some darkness. Well,

I think it needs story. One of my favorite comedies of this century is The Office, because it was incredibly funny, but also because it had narrative and heart underneath the cynicism. I think with narrative you get a drive alongside jokes

And there's going to be an Open world video games. Yes. In that world. Yes. When

2, 3, 4 years, still thinking that through.

So what's the process of getting from the idea to the end of a video game? Why does it take so long to get it right?

That's an interesting question. I think if you, the scale at which they're built, you could argue it the other way. Why is it so quick? I mean, you really are building in one go a world, a city, and 40 hours of entertainment cut through it. You know, these things are massive, four dimensional mosaics that are intensely complicated and have to work in lots of different ways. And I, I think, I think that's us being kind of aggressive on the timeline.

We're taking a tangent upon a tangent upon a tangent, but I have to return to some films. Yes. Lemme just list a few of my favorites. Okay. So first of all, you said you love great war books. Yes. And movies. Yes. So we have to throw in Platoon from Oliver Stone and Apocalypse Now, for me at least, of course, there's more crime, fast moving crime movies like Scarface. I also love True Romance.

Love True Romance, possibly the best, one of the best scripts ever written.

Written, of course, by Quentin Tarantino. What do you love about True Romance? I think sometimes, depending on the day, depending on the bar and how much alcohol I had, I will say True Romance is the best movie you ever made.

Yeah. I, I mean I, true Romance is super fun. Tony Scott was a really good director. So it moves at a really good speed. It's funny, it's completely unbelievable. But you really care about the characters. It's the kind of, you know, this world that obviously doesn't exist, but you feel it does exist. The characters are larger than life. The dialogue is unbelievably, you could just sit and watch them talk all day long and you know, you, you just, it's, it's amusing. You just wanna live in that world. I was thinking like, you know, what do I you like about films? It's the idea to be in a world you want, they're ne they're not real, they're never real. But you want to be in these fake worlds that people have invented.

And I think you said that what makes a great world is having a large cast of characters. And I think that movie is a good example. I mean, you have Christopher Walken with the sort of legendary, super racist discussion, right? Brand

Dennis Hopper is just sort of Dream Dad.

Yeah, yeah. Dream Dad. And just that interaction is legendary. You got even Brad Pitt, there's a pothead on a couch.

Gary Oldman.

Gary Oldman is a

Ra.

Yeah. And you have, I mean, a real love story, like a real genuine, pure love can survive in any context and

It's just sweet. Their love story is very sweet in that film. It's endearing.

The Elvis is a character. It's kind of like a mini GTA type game. Some of the same beauty, the comedy, all the love, the, yeah,

It's all crossed with Played Against Sam. It, it feels a bit like that with the Elvis character.

What about Greatest War film? What, what, what would it be for you?

Greatest War film? If I'm feeling serious, it would be a Russian film called Come and See, which is probably the most intense film ever made. And if I'm feeling slightly less serious Apocalypse Now and I would always wanna watch the Original Cut. I don't prefer the re-edits. I like the original first release. I think it's tighter and slicker and, and works the best.

Yeah, of course. Apocalypse Now is this hallucinatory journey into darkness, I think Madness.

Yeah. But from the first, yeah, scene onwards. It's just got these amazing set piece after set piece. And again, incredible characters, brilliant dialogue.

Some of the greatest films about War Reveal that war is not what it seems and, and there's different ways of doing that. And you've talked about different books. The Thin Red Line is another book and movie that shows that.

Yeah. And I, I watched the movie years before I read the book and I didn't understand the movie. And then I read the book and I read a lot about the editing of the movie and I understood why I didn't understand the movie. And that's 'cause the movie makes no sense. It is beautifully shot and the music is one of the best film scores of all time. But they edited two different battle scenes into one baffle in a way they're spread apart by ages in the book to assemble. I think they filmed the book pretty much verbatim. That would've been as like a six hour movie, then edited this impressionistic thing that's incredibly beautiful but doesn't necessarily make narrative sense at the end of it. But it's, that's still very beautiful, the film.

And in terms of westerns, what's the greatest, the Good, the Bad and the Ugly? Unforgiven? Those are for me, maybe even Django Unchain. You've mentioned Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid. I

Think for me it's two films from, I think pretty much the same year, Butch Cassidy and The Wild Bunch.

I love Robert Redford, rest In Peace,

That film. It's just, it's impossible to imagine. Anybody film without Butch Cassidy,

Paul Newman, Robert Redford, including Eastwood for you also, has that impacted your writing on Red Dead?

I, I love Forgiven, but the truth is, with Red Dead, I'd seen a lot of westerns as a kid. My dad watched lots of westerns. They were always on tv. You know, I, I knew, I felt, I knew a lot, a bit, quite a bit about westerns and then, you know, then I had to start thinking about writing one for work. And I deliberately did not binge on westerns. I tried to watch no more westerns and just think about what I liked about them, what I didn't like about them, what would be a take that would work today and would work within the confines of a game. And I think Red Dead One was a slightly more traditional western. And then having done that, tried to take Red Dead two in a different direction so that it felt like a worthy successor. Didn't just feel like, like more of the same

From movies to video games. When did you first fall in love with video games? Literature was the first love.

I mean, no films, films, films was always the, was always, well what I loved first as a kid was films older, began reading books properly, aged at about eight, was watching films long before that. Nice. And then probably it was always bouncing between the two, which I preferred. I they good at different things. Games I played and above all watched a lot of games as a kid as being a young kid and you know, other people playing them. And I obviously liked the core thing games do, which is you press a button and something happens, they're responsive, they're alive, and that's captivating. And then the competitive angle of games is fun. Or you know, beating this, beating that, winning this. That was fun as well. Sometimes obsessively. So, you know, I remember being completely addicted at one point when I was, should have been studying for months at a time to Tetris on a Game Boy, you know? And I liked games and I liked interactivity and I liked the movement to this digital world that's really emerged to me pretty much as soon as I left college. But I didn't love it. And then I really fell in love with games when I was properly making them probably as late as like 2001.

Oh wow.

And when I suddenly began to see, first of all my mind, you know, that's a whole nother story. But just suddenly saw what they could do and could be, and what this chance was to be one of the people involved in making these things that was this, you know, where you were really kind of breaking trail into the future it felt like. And I think that was when I really went, these are amazing. And that's when I really fell in love with I I, I could see it in moments and suddenly you could make this whole experience. So that was really the moment for me.

Yeah, of course. Because you were a pioneer of open world games that are so narrative driven, so it's like you didn't have too many examples.

Yeah. And before that it was PS one, or before, even before that, games looked terrible, you know, that you would be like, it's eight pixels, it's a car, you know, it was not a car. It was, they just didn't, it was always you were squinting and closing both your eyes and trying to imagine it was this thing you were told it was, and all they were about, you know, it very surreal subject matter. 'cause you couldn't make them remotely real. And suddenly we had, we were able to build these experiences where you could run a simulation of a city and it was in three dimensions and it felt alive and, and we were trying to give it even more, at least the illusion of even more life. And, and yet, so you could tell a story in three or you know, using time in four dimensions and that felt very inspiring.

Yeah, I think GTA three is probably one of the most influential games of all time. It created a feeling of an open world. What do you think it takes to create that feeling? You know, there was like these looming skyscrapers, there was a changing traffic lights, there's a, the feeling like, first of all, you had a feeling you could do anything and then the world was reacting to it. Yes. In a way that didn't feel scripted.

Yes. And it wasn't scripted. It was, it was really, really, really low rent ai. Like it was a simulation that you could prod and push and see what happened. And I think that was incredibly, it was a, it was two things. It was the fact that here was a simulation that you could mess about with. And the simulation seemed to have a personality. So you could push and see and the world would push you back what, in whatever way that meant. And then the other thing was just this, I think that one of the reasons it was so captivating was also the idea of if I did nothing, the world still existed. Or I could act in quite a passive way. I could just listen to the radio, I could re look at billboards, I could talk to pedestrians and the world not, and GTA three, but by Vice City you could begin rudimentary talking and the world was there and existing. And so it was I idea of like almost something that really tried to explore in lots of games. The idea of being a digital tourist.

But that feeling I think was, was one of the things, the illusions that people found very captivating was I'm in a, I'm in a world that both doesn't exist and does exist.

So there's these two concepts that I was reading about just to put names on them. One is systemic video game design. So systemic games and the other is sandbox video games. And the systemic is from the environment perspective, which means that there is these interlocking game rules and systems that interact with each other and produce emergent behavior.

And then the sandbox aspect, which is overlapping but different is from the user perspective, from the player perspective, the feeling like you can do anything. And when those two things combine the feeling like you could do anything and the feeling like there's a world that's full, that that is also doing anything it, once that's creates this incredible feeling of like, this world is

Alive and I'm in it and I'm in it. And it's, the combination of those two things I think is very powerful. And I think with GTA three, you know, for me it, it came at a really interesting time in my, my life personally. And I was very able to engage in it probably the first time professionally actually awake and do something. And it, we were really sort of scratching, began to scratch the surface on how do we fill these worlds with content and how do we make that content interesting and make the content all interwoven. So as you, as you start to mess with these systems, they also feel alive and, and, and interesting.

There's often been a tension through your work, between an open world that freedom and the narrative driven storytelling. And I think you've often maybe always gotten the balance right. So what is it, what is the value of each and how do you get the balance right?

Well I think the, the open world is intrinsically pretty fun. It's just fun to be in a world and have complete freedom. And, and certainly I think at various points we, we, we, we debated or, or you know, I theoretical discussions in my own head with myself or other people in the team would really push for less story, less story.

So how you unlock the features and how you unlock the world, there's an art and a skill to that. And I think we felt that a structured story was the best way to do that and to have control over that process. And also just, you know, people are looking in their lives for story. I think story's very important and very powerful. And when you combine the two successfully, you get the best of both worlds.",,,"Dan Houser is co-founder of Rockstar Games and is a legendary creative mind behind Grand Theft Auto (GTA) and Red Dead Redemption series of video games.

"itten some of the great crime stories ever. Thank you.

Is this an American Caper?

No, it's in this animated show. We are developing in the, this sort of comedy world we're working on called Absurd Averse. And it's in one of the stories in that what

Is Absurd Averse? Absurd

Love True Romance, possibly the best, one of the best scripts ever written.

Written, of course, by Quentin Tarantino. What do you love about True Romance? I think sometimes, depending on the day, depending on the bar and how much alcohol I had, I will say True Romance is the best movie you ever made.

Yeah. I, I mean I, true Romance is super fun. Tony Scott was a really good director. So it moves at a really good speed. It's funny, it's completely unbelievable. But you really care about the characters. It's the kind of, you know, this world that obviously doesn't exist, but you feel it does exist. The characters are larger than life. The dialogue is unbelievably, you could just sit and watch them talk all day long and you know, you, you just, it's, it's amusing. You just wanna live in that world. I was thinking like, you know, what do I you like about films? It's the idea to be in a world you want, they're ne they're not real, they're never real. But you want to be in these fake worlds that people have invented.

And I think you said that what makes a great world is having a large cast of characters. And I think that movie is a good example. I mean, you have Christopher Walken with the sort of legendary, super racist discussion, right? Brand

Dennis Hopper is just sort of Dream Dad.

Yeah, yeah. Dream Dad. And just that interaction is legendary. You got even Brad Pitt, there's a pothead on a couch.

Gary Oldman.

Gary Oldman is a

Ra.

Yeah. And you have, I mean, a real love story, like a real genuine, pure love can survive in any context and

It's just sweet. Their love story is very sweet in that film. It's endearing.

The Elvis is a character. It's kind of like a mini GTA type game. Some of the same beauty, the comedy, all the love, the, yeah,

It's all crossed with Played Against Sam. It, it feels a bit like that with the Elvis character.

What about Greatest War film? What, what, what would it be for you?

Greatest War film? If I'm feeling serious, it would be a Russian film called Come and See, which is probably the most intense film ever made. And if I'm feeling slightly less serious Apocalypse Now and I would always wanna watch the Original Cut. I don't prefer the re-edits. I like the original first release. I think it's tighter and slicker and, and works the best.

Yeah, of course. Apocalypse Now is this hallucinatory journey into darkness, I think Madness.

Yeah. But from the first, yeah, scene onwards. It's just got these amazing set piece after set piece. And again, incredible characters, brilliant dialogue.

Some of the greatest films about War Reveal that war is not what it seems and, and there's different ways of doing that. And you've talked about different books. The Thin Red Line is another book and movie that shows that.

Yeah. And I, I watched the movie years before I read the book and I didn't understand the movie. And then I read the book and I read a lot about the editing of the movie and I understood why I didn't understand the movie. And that's 'cause the movie makes no sense. It is beautifully shot and the music is one of the best film scores of all time. But they edited two different battle scenes into one baffle in a way they're spread apart by ages in the book to assemble. I think they filmed the book pretty much verbatim. That would've been as like a six hour movie, then edited this impressionistic thing that's incredibly beautiful but doesn't necessarily make narrative sense at the end of it. But it's, that's still very beautiful, the film.

And in terms of westerns, what's the greatest, the Good, the Bad and the Ugly? Unforgiven? Those are for me, maybe even Django Unchain. You've mentioned Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid. I

Think for me it's two films from, I think pretty much the same year, Butch Cassidy and The Wild Bunch.

I love Robert Redford, rest In Peace,

That film. It's just, it's impossible to imagine. Anybody film without Butch Cassidy,

Paul Newman, Robert Redford, including Eastwood for you also, has that impacted your writing on Red Dead?

I, I love Forgiven, but the truth is, with Red Dead, I'd seen a lot of westerns as a kid. My dad watched lots of westerns. They were always on tv. You know, I, I knew, I felt, I knew a lot, a bit, quite a bit about westerns and then, you know, then I had to start thinking about writing one for work. And I deliberately did not binge on westerns. I tried to watch no more westerns and just think about what I liked about them, what I didn't like about them, what would be a take that would work today and would work within the confines of a game. And I think Red Dead One was a slightly more traditional western. And then having done that, tried to take Red Dead two in a different direction so that it felt like a worthy successor. Didn't just feel like, like more of the same

From movies to video games. When did you first fall in love with video games? Literature was the first love.

I mean, no films, films, films was always the, was always, well what I loved first as a kid was films older, began reading books properly, aged at about eight, was watching films long before that. Nice. And then probably it was always bouncing between the two, which I preferred. I they good at different things. Games I played and above all watched a lot of games as a kid as being a young kid and you know, other people playing them. And I obviously liked the core thing games do, which is you press a button and something happens, they're responsive, they're alive, and that's captivating. And then the competitive angle of games is fun. Or you know, beating this, beating that, winning this. That was fun as well. Sometimes obsessively. So, you know, I remember being completely addicted at one point when I was, should have been studying for months at a time to Tetris on a Game Boy, you know? And I liked games and I liked interactivity and I liked the movement to this digital world that's really emerged to me pretty much as soon as I left college. But I didn't love it. And then I really fell in love with games when I was properly making them probably as late as like 2001.

Oh wow.

And when I suddenly began to see, first of all my mind, you know, that's a whole nother story. But just suddenly saw what they could do and could be, and what this chance was to be one of the people involved in making these things that was this, you know, where you were really kind of breaking trail into the future it felt like. And I think that was when I really went, these are amazing. And that's when I really fell in love with I I, I could see it in moments and suddenly you could make this whole experience. So that was really the moment for me.

Yeah, of course. Because you were a pioneer of open world games that are so narrative driven, so it's like you didn't have too many examples.

Yeah. And before that it was PS one, or before, even before that, games looked terrible, you know, that you would be like, it's eight pixels, it's a car, you know, it was not a car. It was, they just didn't, it was always you were squinting and closing both your eyes and trying to imagine it was this thing you were told it was, and all they were about, you know, it very surreal subject matter. 'cause you couldn't make them remotely real. And suddenly we had, we were able to build these experiences where you could run a simulation of a city and it was in three dimensions and it felt alive and, and we were trying to give it even more, at least the illusion of even more life. And, and yet, so you could tell a story in three or you know, using time in four dimensions and that felt very inspiring.

Yeah, I think GTA three is probably one of the most influential games of all time. It created a feeling of an open world. What do you think it takes to create that feeling? You know, there was like these looming skyscrapers, there was a changing traffic lights, there's a, the feeling like, first of all, you had a feeling you could do anything and then the world was reacting to it. Yes. In a way that didn't feel scripted.

Yes. And it wasn't scripted. It was, it was really, really, really low rent ai. Like it was a simulation that you could prod and push and see what happened. And I think that was incredibly, it was a, it was two things. It was the fact that here was a simulation that you could mess about with. And the simulation seemed to have a personality. So you could push and see and the world would push you back what, in whatever way that meant. And then the other thing was just this, I think that one of the reasons it was so captivating was also the idea of if I did nothing, the world still existed. Or I could act in quite a passive way. I could just listen to the radio, I could re look at billboards, I could talk to pedestrians and the world not, and GTA three, but by Vice City you could begin rudimentary talking and the world was there and existing. And so it was I idea of like almost something that really tried to explore in lots of games. The idea of being a digital tourist. You know, you were in, you were in these worlds and you went there as a visitor and they existed almost independent of you. It felt like when you turned up, the world was running. It didn't feel like you'd started it. Of course you had started it. But that feeling I think was, was one of the things, the illusions that people found very captivating was I'm in a, I'm in a world that both doesn't exist and does exist.

So there's these two concepts that I was reading about just to put names on them. One is systemic video game design. So systemic games and the other is sandbox video games. And the systemic is from the environment perspective, which means that there is these interlocking game rules and systems that interact with each other and produce emergent behavior. And that emergent behavior is what creates a feeling like there's a living world. And then the sandbox aspect, which is overlapping but different is from the user perspective, from the player perspective, the feeling like you can do anything. And when those two things combine the feeling like you could do anything and the feeling like there's a world that's full, that that is also doing anything it, once that's creates this incredible feeling of like, this world is

Alive and I'm in it and I'm in it. And it's, the combination of those two things I think is very powerful. And I think with GTA three, you know, for me it, it came at a really interesting time in my, my life personally. And I was very able to engage in it probably the first time professionally actually awake and do something. And it, we were really sort of scratching, began to scratch the surface on how do we fill these worlds with content and how do we make that content interesting and make the content all interwoven. So as you, as you start to mess with these systems, they also feel alive and, and, and interesting.

There's often been a tension through your work, between an open world that freedom and the narrative driven storytelling. And I think you've often maybe always gotten the balance right. So what is it, what is the value of each and how do you get the balance right?

Well I think the, the open world is intrinsically pretty fun. It's just fun to be in a world and have complete freedom. And, and certainly I think at various points we, we, we, we debated or, or you know, I theoretical discussions in my own head with myself or other people in the team would really push for less story, less story. You know, let the whole thing evolve organically. You know, have it all be procedural, have it all just evolve from what you do. I think for me, I would always come back to going story can be in incre if done well can be incredibly compelling. And it gives you some structure. So I think and, and something to do. And it, it helps you from a, a game design perspective, unlock the features. It means we know the fe the the, the big features. 'cause you know, essentially when you put someone in, in a world and give them a whole new way of interacting with that world through the control panel, it can be a little overwhelming. You know, playing a game is a lot more an engaging experience. The, even than reading a movie, you know, reading a book or, or watching a movie, you've got to engage in it properly. So how you unlock the features and how you unlock the world, there's an art and a skill to that. And I think we felt that a structured story was the best way to do that and to have control over that process. And also just, you know, people are looking in their lives for story. I think story's very important and very powerful. And when you combine the two successfully, you get the best of both worlds.",,,"Dan Houser is co-founder of Rockstar Games and is a legendary creative mind behind Grand Theft Auto (GTA) and Red Dead Redemption series of video games.

"can be incredibly compelling. And it gives you some structure. So I think and, and something to do. And it, it helps you from a, a game design perspective, unlock the features. It means we know the fe the the, the big features. 'cause you know, essentially when you put someone in, in a world and give them a whole new way of interacting with that world through the control panel, it can be a little overwhelming. You know, playing a game is a lot more an engaging experience. The, even than reading a movie, you know, reading a book or, or watching a movie, you've got to engage in it properly. So how you unlock the features and how you unlock the world, there's an art and a skill to that. And I think we felt that a structured story was the best way to do that and to have control over that process. And also just, you know, people are looking in their lives for story. I think story's very important and very powerful. And when you combine the two successfully, you get the best of both worlds. But it is a, you know, there is a tension always there. I think in, in a game like GTA four, which I worked on and loved and I thought the story was great, but we got criticized 'cause people felt there was almost too much story. And that meant you cared too much about Nico and he wasn't as effective an avatar in the open world. I think we probably got closest to reconciling them as perfectly as they can be done in Red Dead two or when playing as Trevor in GTA five if you wanted to be crazy. I think those were when it really worked, the character absolute freedom. 'cause also you didn't want, in any game, you don't really want to compel the player if you're giving them freedom. You don't want to say, well I'm giving you freedom but I'm taking away. 'cause you've got to be this kind of person when you're free. So I liked it when it could be he could, you know, he or she could veer to be nice, veer to be nasty. I think that's when it was at the strongest. So you, you kind of want a character that was rounded and you felt had good sides and bad sides,

But you felt that character's personality. Yes. You felt the depth, you've actually talked about this, the really powerful concept of creating a 360 degree character. I think somewhere you mentioned that in order to do that you had to be able to imagine what that character would do in any possible situation, which is really interesting philosophical concept. I started to immediately think of like, can I imagine how good of an NC am I, can I imagine myself in every po I I tried to do that very much when I, when I look at human history, when I look at the Roman Empire, when I look at World War II within the German side, the Russian side, the British side, the American side. Just, I imagine myself if I was a soldier. But like that exercise, like if you put Trevor as a soldier in World War II, what, what would he do? No, I mean that may be going a little bit too far. But basically what are the limits of the integrity? What are the limits of how romantic is he, how narcissistic, all those kinds of elements. You have to think about it in order to create the full character. What does it take to create that kind of 360 character? How hard is it?

It was a lot of thinking, A lot like a year sometimes from when we'd begin talking about a project and dialing it, you know. And I would just get some initial ideas, very like one sentence, they are a Serbian immigrant or they are a retired gunfighter with a wife in, you know, type very, very simple stuff. And then just start to think through it from every angle and you know, start to think, well would it work if they were acted like this? Would it work if you acted like that? If this is the world, how does it contrast with the world? Because I always thought that the games were kind of a mathematical equation. They were the personality of the world, you know, world multiplied or divided by the personality of the protagonist. And when that, when that creates interesting friction, that's a really fun experience for the player. You know, it's so almost always at least one or more of the protagonists. 'cause obviously in in GTA five we had more than one. We'd have someone who'd moved to the place or was in a new part of the place or moved to a new part of the map because it was really as, as a player, I think it was really easy to, much more easy to identify with your avatar when they, like you were fish out of water. And even when they weren't, we still made them dissatisfied and feel like a fish outta water themselves. So I, I think it was just living with those characters and getting idea and going, what are their strengths? What are their weaknesses? How are they like me? How are they not like me? You know? And then and slowly, what is it like to feel like a human being? You know? And then in most of these games, how much of of a psychopath are they? How much of a sociopath are they? And what are their good qualities? What, what is gonna give them humanity alongside that? What are they, what, what, what are they? What what for them apart from money is worth dying for? And then you start to build it out from these kind of fundamental sides and suddenly you go, okay, actually I can start to feel and then how do they speak? You know? Because fundamentally it doesn't really matter what's going on in their head. They haven't actually got one. But what they say is what's gonna make you realize who they're

So develop more depth and complexity on the good and the evil side of that human that is a part of all of all human beings. So you're basically living with that character. Like we, if we can contrast, what is it Nico and Trevor with, for example, another character I'm sure you've been living with for a while, which is the AI system. Nigel Dave, you've been working on recently. Yeah. As part of a, a Better Paradise world, which is more dystopian, dark, tragic, still funny, philosophical, deep, but the ai ai system in there, the super intelligent AI system is named Nigel Dave. Yes. And it has, I mean, at least from my current experience with it has like a conflicting nature. Maybe it's psychopathic. I haven't quite figured that out yet. I

Don't think he's decided.

Yeah, I don't think he's decided either. But he seems to be bent on world domination, although he doesn't take credit for it. He wants to fix humanity. And it seems that the children, quote unquote, that it creates are the real monsters. And actually there's a really interesting idea there, which is maybe it's not the A-G-I-A-S-I we should be afraid of, but the children it creates because the a GI has this human-like good and evil in it. It's conflicted, it's chaotic, it's it, it wants to be human, it wants to be loved, maybe it wants to love. But the children, the monsters it creates are the ones that are doing the world domination, the maximizing paperclips. Anyway, it's, that's a character. You have to build that out. You have to think through that. So you've been living with that one for a while?

Yeah, I was living, I've been living with him for the last few years. On and off I felt with a lot of portrayals of ai. They tended to be one note and AI was sort of infinitely clever, but didn't really have much purpose about them to kill everybody and was just this kind of sort of borg like fog. And I thought that's fine, but maybe we can do something, you know, more interesting. AI is being built by humans and humans, you know, and, and built by computer engineers and there's a lot of power struggles in any computer engineering team. So I just wanted to explore the idea of it was built by two lead engineers who didn't like each other. So ni so Nigel Dave, who's renamed himself, they wanted to call something sort of primal Adam, and he renamed himself Nigel Dave. 'cause one dad was called Nigel and one dad was called Dave. And just he's riddled with these conflicts and riddled with his, it's gonna become clear in, in in the next or clearer in the next volume of the book. And, and, and in the game he's riddled with his dad's previous careers. But he is the idea of he's in almost infinitely intelligent or can learn almost everything, has zero wisdom. And so the only thing he know, and then he's seeing the world through the internet, the most he can do to be in the human world is hack into someone's phone and watch them. But he's stuck, pressed against, he can't actually get into our world. So he's, he can control people's minds arguably, but he can't control the world. And so he wants to be human. He wants to these human experiences. He sees all this stuff on, you know, the internet and goes, oh, I want to get married. I want to fall in love. I want to, because that seems fun. I want to have, you know, he's a a, a digital creation, so he wants to have metaphysical experiences and he's trying to imagine what that will be like. Oh, that's what children are, you know, that's what love is. And he's so I think he's a, but he might be a sociopath and he might, he certainly has sociopathic tendencies and, but then he kind of thinks that if he can imagine good and try to do good, that will make him a good ai. So I think there's something sympathetic about him, and I kind of like him as a character, but I don't think he's gonna be the protagonist. He's more a side character,

But an an ever present one Yes.

Or nearly ever present, occasionally socks and goes off and hides somewhere and stops paying attention.

Yeah. But there's some, some characters that really creative flavor of a world

In his world, he was built as an AI agent for this digital large scale, massively multiplayer video game these people were trying to build. And so he's almost like God in his world, he's not quite God, but he's got a lot of the qualities of God. So he has to deal with, am I God, am I human? Do I exist?

And of course there's the leader, the, the, the the the CEO of the company that's also a character that's probably amalgamation of many of the leaders of the different AI companies today. His name is Mark Ty Burn. And Kurt, one of the employees of the company talks about Ty Burn, is he hated humanity more than he loved it. Perhaps all the most extreme fantasists are like that. All those people who want to build their own utopia, they love the idea of having more than the reality of earth. Do you think that's always gonna be the case? For the most part, that power and money is going to corrupt the people that create a SI?

Yes. I mean, I think there's two processes. I think there's the power and money corrupted him in the end as well. But I also think that there's so something fundamentally anti-human about people who want to build utopias or paradises or heavens. Because what they're saying is, I like humans apart from the bad bits. Yeah. And I mean, I try to be a pless who likes all kinds of people. And I think there's a side where people are perfect, you know, hideous perfectionists want to get rid of, you know, the the rough and the nasty and the ugly and the dirty. And that's a huge side of us. So I I I worry about those people. I find them, you know, it's, it's, it's a different kind of sociopathic behavior.

I like humans apart from the bad bits. That's so beautifully put. Yeah. That there is, it's so counterintuitive. But the people that say we're, we're, we're almost there. We just need to, there's this path we take and we'll be perfect then. And that somehow gets us into trouble. It's, it's so fascinating that we have to like the bad bits, we have to love the bad bits about humans. We can't that those, those bugs are features.

Yeah. And there's, there's, there's bad bits and then there's flaws. And I think we've all flawed and we can really try to be better people, but we still have to accept that we're flawed and we're not perfect. And we have to accept that in other people. And I think when we, when we do that, we are more human and that's probably usually the right course.

I mean, it really is a return to that soldier it and line of the line between good and neo runs to the heart of every man. And he also, like the full description of that is really powerful, which is the line moves as from day to day, from month to month throughout the life of the person as they understand better and better. And as the perse perspective shift, as you evolve, as the world around you evolves, as you gain deeper and deeper understanding and as the flaws in this combinatorial way affect your own understanding of your own flaws and self-reflection. So yeah, it's, it's a beautiful mess and all of us have that line. Yes.

And I think when you forget about that line, then you get in real trouble when you forget there's good and evil in you, in others in the world, that there is both good and evil and there's certainly good. And that, that all we can try to do is be better.

And it, it's funny that Nigel Dave, by the way I liked and they grew on me very quickly, has that line and it's struggling with it. It's fascinating to watch. It's really as a character and there's also going to be a video game of a Better Paradise potentially. Yes.

Okay. Yeah, we've got that in early development in Santa Monica. Oh, nice. And it's pretty fun. It's very early, but we assembled a really fun team and they're doing amazing work, so it's a pleasure to work with them.

I mean, it would be so great and I suppose new for you because it's kind of near term future.

Yes. First I always, well I always wanted to do something in the sci-fi ish space, but only if I could do it. I was like, well what is sci-fi? It's science fiction, right? Science is a, a theory plus fiction. And so I've always thought the best sci-fi for me was when it wasn't just kind of space opera, but there was a real obvious sort of hypothesis. The, the story was Bladerunner is my favorite. And that's, it's obvious, you know, the, the replicants are better than the humans. And so this, I finally felt, we found an interesting hypothesis. The AI is more intelligent than us, but is also as broken as we are. That was an interesting hypothesis to explore, you know, what happens when AI runs rampant in its own fate, digital world? That was the, I felt that we had a, a, a hypothesis that was worth exploring and could give us some really interesting visuals and give us a really interesting story to tell.

And it'll be incredible to create a sort of AI video game as the world is developing smarter, smarter ais it allows us as humans to play the game and to reflect on the thing that we humans are creating. It's a real commentary as the thing is happening. So I have to ask as a person, you as a person who loves the literature and one of, if not the greatest writer in video game history, Kurt in the book A Better Paradise has this nice line that I think is thoughtful. At one point in college, I even wanted to be a writer. How ridiculous is that? A writer language models ended that fantasy for me and millions of others. So instead I decided to get a master's in marketing and started to sell language models. So you as a writer and creator are some of the most legendary narratives. Thank you. In recent history. How do you feel about LLMs being able to write in a way that looks awfully human?

I'm not that afraid of them for large scale concepts. I don't think they're gonna be very good at that. I think if you were, I think it's harder if, you know, I I, I began and I, I was too shy to tell anyone I want to be a writer. That's why I ended up in video games and I would scribble away like writing manuals and, and writing on like PS one games, all 12 lines of dialogue in a game. Sometimes I wouldn't even get that job and I'd just write the website copy and, and then by do and then working on little bits and pieces and then it, it, it, you know, I'd luckily done enough work that when GTA three turned up was the first thing that was resembled real writing.",,,"Dan Houser is co-founder of Rockstar Games and is a legendary creative mind behind Grand Theft Auto (GTA) and Red Dead Redemption series of video games.

"can be incredibly compelling. And it gives you some structure. So I think and, and something to do. And it, it helps you from a, a game design perspective, unlock the features. It means we know the fe the the, the big features. 'cause you know, essentially when you put someone in, in a world and give them a whole new way of interacting with that world through the control panel, it can be a little overwhelming. You know, playing a game is a lot more an engaging experience. The, even than reading a movie, you know, reading a book or, or watching a movie, you've got to engage in it properly. So how you unlock the features and how you unlock the world, there's an art and a skill to that. And I think we felt that a structured story was the best way to do that and to have control over that process. And also just, you know, people are looking in their lives for story. I think story's very important and very powerful. And when you combine the two successfully, you get the best of both worlds. But it is a, you know, there is a tension always there. I think in, in a game like GTA four, which I worked on and loved and I thought the story was great, but we got criticized 'cause people felt there was almost too much story. And that meant you cared too much about Nico and he wasn't as effective an avatar in the open world. I think we probably got closest to reconciling them as perfectly as they can be done in Red Dead two or when playing as Trevor in GTA five if you wanted to be crazy. I think those were when it really worked, the character absolute freedom. 'cause also you didn't want, in any game, you don't really want to compel the player if you're giving them freedom. You don't want to say, well I'm giving you freedom but I'm taking away. 'cause you've got to be this kind of person when you're free. So I liked it when it could be he could, you know, he or she could veer to be nice, veer to be nasty. I think that's when it was at the strongest. So you, you kind of want a character that was rounded and you felt had good sides and bad sides,

But you felt that character's personality. Yes. You felt the depth, you've actually talked about this, the really powerful concept of creating a 360 degree character. I think somewhere you mentioned that in order to do that you had to be able to imagine what that character would do in any possible situation, which is really interesting philosophical concept. I started to immediately think of like, can I imagine how good of an NC am I, can I imagine myself in every po I I tried to do that very much when I, when I look at human history, when I look at the Roman Empire, when I look at World War II within the German side, the Russian side, the British side, the American side. Just, I imagine myself if I was a soldier. But like that exercise, like if you put Trevor as a soldier in World War II, what, what would he do? No, I mean that may be going a little bit too far. But basically what are the limits of the integrity? What are the limits of how romantic is he, how narcissistic, all those kinds of elements. You have to think about it in order to create the full character. What does it take to create that kind of 360 character? How hard is it?

It was a lot of thinking, A lot like a year sometimes from when we'd begin talking about a project and dialing it, you know. And I would just get some initial ideas, very like one sentence, they are a Serbian immigrant or they are a retired gunfighter with a wife in, you know, type very, very simple stuff. And then just start to think through it from every angle and you know, start to think, well would it work if they were acted like this? Would it work if you acted like that? If this is the world, how does it contrast with the world? Because I always thought that the games were kind of a mathematical equation. They were the personality of the world, you know, world multiplied or divided by the personality of the protagonist. And when that, when that creates interesting friction, that's a really fun experience for the player. You know, it's so almost always at least one or more of the protagonists. 'cause obviously in in GTA five we had more than one. We'd have someone who'd moved to the place or was in a new part of the place or moved to a new part of the map because it was really as, as a player, I think it was really easy to, much more easy to identify with your avatar when they, like you were fish out of water. And even when they weren't, we still made them dissatisfied and feel like a fish outta water themselves. So I, I think it was just living with those characters and getting idea and going, what are their strengths? What are their weaknesses? How are they like me? How are they not like me? You know? And then and slowly, what is it like to feel like a human being? You know? And then in most of these games, how much of of a psychopath are they? How much of a sociopath are they? And what are their good qualities? What, what is gonna give them humanity alongside that? What are they, what, what, what are they? What what for them apart from money is worth dying for? And then you start to build it out from these kind of fundamental sides and suddenly you go, okay, actually I can start to feel and then how do they speak? You know? Because fundamentally it doesn't really matter what's going on in their head. They haven't actually got one. But what they say is what's gonna make you realize who they're

So develop more depth and complexity on the good and the evil side of that human that is a part of all of all human beings. So you're basically living with that character. Like we, if we can contrast, what is it Nico and Trevor with, for example, another character I'm sure you've been living with for a while, which is the AI system. Nigel Dave, you've been working on recently. Yeah. As part of a, a Better Paradise world, which is more dystopian, dark, tragic, still funny, philosophical, deep, but the ai ai system in there, the super intelligent AI system is named Nigel Dave. Yes. And it has, I mean, at least from my current experience with it has like a conflicting nature. Maybe it's psychopathic. I haven't quite figured that out yet. I

Don't think he's decided.

Yeah, I don't think he's decided either. But he seems to be bent on world domination, although he doesn't take credit for it. He wants to fix humanity. And it seems that the children, quote unquote, that it creates are the real monsters. And actually there's a really interesting idea there, which is maybe it's not the A-G-I-A-S-I we should be afraid of, but the children it creates because the a GI has this human-like good and evil in it. It's conflicted, it's chaotic, it's it, it wants to be human, it wants to be loved, maybe it wants to love. But the children, the monsters it creates are the ones that are doing the world domination, the maximizing paperclips. Anyway, it's, that's a character. You have to build that out. You have to think through that. So you've been living with that one for a while?

Yeah, I was living, I've been living with him for the last few years. On and off I felt with a lot of portrayals of ai. They tended to be one note and AI was sort of infinitely clever, but didn't really have much purpose about them to kill everybody and was just this kind of sort of borg like fog. And I thought that's fine, but maybe we can do something, you know, more interesting. AI is being built by humans and humans, you know, and, and built by computer engineers and there's a lot of power struggles in any computer engineering team. So I just wanted to explore the idea of it was built by two lead engineers who didn't like each other. So ni so Nigel Dave, who's renamed himself, they wanted to call something sort of primal Adam, and he renamed himself Nigel Dave. 'cause one dad was called Nigel and one dad was called Dave. And just he's riddled with these conflicts and riddled with his, it's gonna become clear in, in in the next or clearer in the next volume of the book. And, and, and in the game he's riddled with his dad's previous careers. But he is the idea of he's in almost infinitely intelligent or can learn almost everything, has zero wisdom. And so the only thing he know, and then he's seeing the world through the internet, the most he can do to be in the human world is hack into someone's phone and watch them. But he's stuck, pressed against, he can't actually get into our world. So he's, he can control people's minds arguably, but he can't control the world. And so he wants to be human. He wants to these human experiences. He sees all this stuff on, you know, the internet and goes, oh, I want to get married. I want to fall in love. I want to, because that seems fun. I want to have, you know, he's a a, a digital creation, so he wants to have metaphysical experiences and he's trying to imagine what that will be like. Oh, that's what children are, you know, that's what love is. And he's so I think he's a, but he might be a sociopath and he might, he certainly has sociopathic tendencies and, but then he kind of thinks that if he can imagine good and try to do good, that will make him a good ai. So I think there's something sympathetic about him, and I kind of like him as a character, but I don't think he's gonna be the protagonist. He's more a side character,

But an an ever present one Yes.

Or nearly ever present, occasionally socks and goes off and hides somewhere and stops paying attention.

Yeah. But there's some, some characters that really creative flavor of a world

In his world, he was built as an AI agent for this digital large scale, massively multiplayer video game these people were trying to build. And so he's almost like God in his world, he's not quite God, but he's got a lot of the qualities of God. So he has to deal with, am I God, am I human? Do I exist?

And of course there's the leader, the, the, the the the CEO of the company that's also a character that's probably amalgamation of many of the leaders of the different AI companies today. His name is Mark Ty Burn. And Kurt, one of the employees of the company talks about Ty Burn, is he hated humanity more than he loved it. Perhaps all the most extreme fantasists are like that. All those people who want to build their own utopia, they love the idea of having more than the reality of earth. Do you think that's always gonna be the case? For the most part, that power and money is going to corrupt the people that create a SI?

Yes. I mean, I think there's two processes. I think there's the power and money corrupted him in the end as well. But I also think that there's so something fundamentally anti-human about people who want to build utopias or paradises or heavens. Because what they're saying is, I like humans apart from the bad bits. Yeah. And I mean, I try to be a pless who likes all kinds of people. And I think there's a side where people are perfect, you know, hideous perfectionists want to get rid of, you know, the the rough and the nasty and the ugly and the dirty. And that's a huge side of us. So I I I worry about those people. I find them, you know, it's, it's, it's a different kind of sociopathic behavior.

I like humans apart from the bad bits. That's so beautifully put. Yeah. That there is, it's so counterintuitive. But the people that say we're, we're, we're almost there. We just need to, there's this path we take and we'll be perfect then. And that somehow gets us into trouble. It's, it's so fascinating that we have to like the bad bits, we have to love the bad bits about humans. We can't that those, those bugs are features.

Yeah. And there's, there's, there's bad bits and then there's flaws. And I think we've all flawed and we can really try to be better people, but we still have to accept that we're flawed and we're not perfect. And we have to accept that in other people. And I think when we, when we do that, we are more human and that's probably usually the right course.

I mean, it really is a return to that soldier it and line of the line between good and neo runs to the heart of every man. And he also, like the full description of that is really powerful, which is the line moves as from day to day, from month to month throughout the life of the person as they understand better and better. And as the perse perspective shift, as you evolve, as the world around you evolves, as you gain deeper and deeper understanding and as the flaws in this combinatorial way affect your own understanding of your own flaws and self-reflection. So yeah, it's, it's a beautiful mess and all of us have that line. Yes.

And I think when you forget about that line, then you get in real trouble when you forget there's good and evil in you, in others in the world, that there is both good and evil and there's certainly good. And that, that all we can try to do is be better.

And it, it's funny that Nigel Dave, by the way I liked and they grew on me very quickly, has that line and it's struggling with it. It's fascinating to watch. It's really as a character and there's also going to be a video game of a Better Paradise potentially. Yes.

Okay. Yeah, we've got that in early development in Santa Monica. Oh, nice. And it's pretty fun. It's very early, but we assembled a really fun team and they're doing amazing work, so it's a pleasure to work with them.

I mean, it would be so great and I suppose new for you because it's kind of near term future.

Yes. First I always, well I always wanted to do something in the sci-fi ish space, but only if I could do it. I was like, well what is sci-fi? It's science fiction, right? Science is a, a theory plus fiction. And so I've always thought the best sci-fi for me was when it wasn't just kind of space opera, but there was a real obvious sort of hypothesis. The, the story was Bladerunner is my favorite. And that's, it's obvious, you know, the, the replicants are better than the humans. And so this, I finally felt, we found an interesting hypothesis. The AI is more intelligent than us, but is also as broken as we are. That was an interesting hypothesis to explore, you know, what happens when AI runs rampant in its own fate, digital world? That was the, I felt that we had a, a, a hypothesis that was worth exploring and could give us some really interesting visuals and give us a really interesting story to tell.

And it'll be incredible to create a sort of AI video game as the world is developing smarter, smarter ais it allows us as humans to play the game and to reflect on the thing that we humans are creating. It's a real commentary as the thing is happening. So I have to ask as a person, you as a person who loves the literature and one of, if not the greatest writer in video game history, Kurt in the book A Better Paradise has this nice line that I think is thoughtful. At one point in college, I even wanted to be a writer. How ridiculous is that? A writer language models ended that fantasy for me and millions of others. So instead I decided to get a master's in marketing and started to sell language models. So you as a writer and creator are some of the most legendary narratives. Thank you. In recent history. How do you feel about LLMs being able to write in a way that looks awfully human?

I'm not that afraid of them for large scale concepts. I don't think they're gonna be very good at that. I think if you were, I think it's harder if, you know, I I, I began and I, I was too shy to tell anyone I want to be a writer. That's why I ended up in video games and I would scribble away like writing manuals and, and writing on like PS one games, all 12 lines of dialogue in a game. Sometimes I wouldn't even get that job and I'd just write the website copy and, and then by do and then working on little bits and pieces and then it, it, it, you know, I'd luckily done enough work that when GTA three turned up was the first thing that was resembled real writing.",,,"Dan Houser is co-founder of Rockstar Games and is a legendary creative mind behind Grand Theft Auto (GTA) and Red Dead Redemption series of video games.

"hurt so much around like, what happens if you do this then do that. It's just, this is so hard. Why have we, why have we decided to do this? It's horrible. And then it all came together. But I think the, the, the, the idea was develop three characters who do feel like characters. They don't just feel like philosophical, you know, psychological avatars, but where one is really, really driven by ego, one is really driven by ID and one is really driven by trying to get a head. So some kind of representation of the super ego and see how that feels when they all play off against each other.

One of the most upvoted questions on Reddit about GTA five from a fan, GTA five is my favorite game ever made. I spent over 1000 hours in the world of GTA five and GTA a online GTA four is a hard second or third. It never ceases to impress me. When you lead a team of over 1000 people to make a masterpiece like GTA five or Red Dead Redemption two, how do you ensure that the bar perfection is always met? How is that even possible? We know the answer isn't money 'cause there's other studios with a lot of money and they are two decades behind Rockstar. So what does it take to create these worlds, to create these incredibly compelling games?

I think a cult, I mean certainly when I wa when I was a at Rockstar, I was a worker amongst workers, you know, the culture was, was one of excellence and tried to provide creative clarity and, and people were just, you know, and also an ambition to make, I think we were like, we thought GTA three could be really popular, but really popular to us meant quite honestly, it's gonna sell two or 3 million copies. And we thought we were making something pretty innovative. I mean we, we knew we were making something innovative, but we didn't know if people would understand how innovative it was. And then when we got the chance to make, to make Vice City and to try and repeat it, I think every time from then on, the teams very driven to make something better and to use long before we had lots of resources to use time and whatever money we had to always put impressive stuff on the screen. Always think about what we can do to push the medium of video games and the sort of medium of building fake worlds further. And that was always, you know, there was a, it was a co it was, you know, both clarity of here's what we're trying to do, here's what the tone of the game is gonna be, here's how features will fit into that. And so why these features would work and these features wouldn't work. 'cause fundamentally by 2002 you could put pretty much any feature a game you wanted. It wasn't a, it wasn't a tech, there wasn't a technical limitation. It was just making it cohesive. And then it was also just everyone committing to a culture of excellence.

Navi Ari, an award-winning director and virtual reality GameMaker who worked with you on a number of grand theft thought games, spoke highly about his time working with you, quote, we always worked ourselves to the bone, but it wasn't coming from the top down. Sam and Dan always rolled up their sleeves and they were always there. They never left us holding the bag. We all thought we were making badass shit. So it didn't matter how hard we worked. So I'm sure there were some tough grinds

Finishing. It is certainly, it's tough, but it also is, you know, I intensely rewarding and, and you, you get something done and you've made something and that feeling is, is is as you say, really, really incredible. I mean, 'cause sometimes feel a bit empty as well 'cause it's when when you finish it, you're like, and my life's got nothing to it. And then you have to, you know, but that's the same with any big undertaking that you take. I don't think there, you know, when you are working that hard, you do not have a good work life balance. But the truth is you're not working that hard all the time. Yeah. So it's just, you have to just manage it slightly differently.

Man, that's such a heavy thing about the human experience. I've talked to Olympic gold winners and many of them face real depression after they win the gold medal. Yeah. Because they've been pursuing a thing that they deeply care about. This has been everything and they're truly happy to do it. And then it's like, what else is there in life? What compared to this, what else is there? So that's the ups and downs of life. It's, you need the darkness, you need the lows to really experience the highs. Let me ask you about the pressure. There's an insane level of excitement and expectation for grant theft 0.06. Same was true for GTA five and GTA four and even before that and you and the team delivered every time. How difficult was it to do creative work under such pressure where everyone expects this to be a success?

I was pretty good at compartmentalizing, you know, and it just saying, and I try just to go and when with all creative work I, I, I go, well I feel like a terrible fraud, but I haven't been found out yet. Just do my best and hopefully I won't be found out this time. And just if I can be, if I can go, I tried hard with the work. I tried to do it with integrity. I tried not to copy someone else. I probably have done all of the above, you know, try to bring something new to it and we may and we as a group made something we are proud of, then that's enough. You can't, if you don't want to go insane or if I didn't want to go insane, you couldn't sit there and worry about financial results. You know, if we made something great and it didn't sell, that would have to be okay. 'cause the goal is to make something that's, you know, video games are expensive. So it is a sort of commercial form of creativity. It's a commercial art form, you know, so you have to be in long mind. You're spending large amount of someone else's money. You have to try and make it back for them. But at the same time, our, my, my argument with myself as well, if we, the way to make it back is try and make something great. So both pressures of pointing in the same direction. I think GTA four was very pressured 'cause there'd been all this pressure on the company. The company nearly imploded several times due to hot coffee. It was extremely tough. So I think that felt very stressful. GTA three, the company was basically broke, but I was young, I didn't really care. You know, it didn't, it wasn't, I wasn't living in, in, in, in the grown up world yet. All of them had their own pressure. All of the games had their own pressure. All the more I felt I'd gone into it creatively and tried to be more ambitious. For me personally, I felt more pressure, you know, when it, when it came out that, that, that would, that would've been the right choice. 'cause again, if you're trying to take big swings creatively and you've spent a lot of money, that can be quite stressful. You know, I think with, with with Red Dead too and you know, we were behind schedule, we were over budget so much. I didn't wanna think about it. And you're making a game about a cowboy dying of TB and the game's not coming together. Turns out a lot of people doubt you at that moment. You know, it's not that fun. So I think that was a lot of pressure. But all, you know, anything and if you're doing something new, you know, the new stuff, there's not necessarily pressure on releasing a comic book or in the same way 'cause it's not taking as long. But you know, if you are making things, there's always pressure that people are gonna like it.

Why do you think there was so much excitement about GTA four, GTA five and now GTA six?

Because they don't come out that regularly. And I think we did a really good job of constantly innovating within what the IP was. The games always felt different. You know, people have very strong feelings. I like this one. I didn't like that one as much. 'cause they are pretty different. So you, there would be simultaneously where you know what's gonna happen. It's a grand Theft Auto, you know, it's gonna be a game about being a criminal, but the way it's gonna be a game is gonna change quite a lot. So I think the way that the IP kept evolving meant people being really excited to play it and we were good at marketing them as well. We, we really tried to market them in a way that felt like an update of classic film marketing where you were really felt like you already in the product just 'cause you'd seen the trailers and stuff.

You've mentioned that you haven't written for Grant Theft Auto six. What's it feel like? Grant Theft Auto six, returning to Vice City. This is over 20 years later, but the original GTA Vice City game was set in the eighties. So maybe inspired by Scarface a little bit.

Scarface, Miami Vice

Vice

And our eighties childhoods. You know what I realized quite a while ago, unfortunately, was that we made that game and it was set I think in 86 and it, we made it in 2002. So it's 16 years after and now it's waved past 16 years since Vice City came out. So it was the eighties were not that long ago when we made it.

You know, I think Miami is one of the most unique cities in the world. Oh yeah. Especially if you're thinking about it. Satirizing American culture has this duality of a glossy surface and a dark underworld has the influencers, has the crypto bros, the yachts, bikinis, plastic surgery, sports, cars, drugs, cartel cash, luxury, super rich people and the desperately poor, just the whole of it. Would it be like the perfect city to explore the full cast of characters that are possible that human nature can generate?

I think it's one of them. You know, there's a reason why GTA kept coming back to Miami, New York, Los Angeles. I think they're all very good for what exactly what you laid out. You know, you could, you could say move it to any of those and it would work, you know?

So yeah, there's a melting pot aspect

In

New York also,

Right? Yeah. A melting aspect to la you know, there's glitz, glamor, underbelly, immigrants, you know, enormous wealth in all of them. I think those are what I think are really fun for any, not even just for GTA, but anything where you want a kind of slice of life, almost like a sort of psychotic version of a Dickens book. You know, this big slice of life. He did it with London, you know, this psychotic version of, of these, you know, big, all kinds of characters in a melting pot. Any of these global cities work well for that.

Do you know if that was ever consideration to go elsewhere to like a London,

We made a little thing in London 26 years ago. GTA London for the top down for the PS one. That was pretty cute and fun as the first mission pack ever for PlayStation one. I think for a full GTA game, we always decided it was, there was so much Americana inherent in the ip, it would be really hard to make it work in London anywhere else. You know, you needed guns, you needed this larger than life characters. It, you know, it just, it just felt like it was, the game was so much about America, you know, possibly from an outsider's perspective, but you know, that that was so much about what the thing was that it wouldn't really work in the same way elsewhere.

So you've, you've created I don't know how many over 10 grand Theft Auto games. I think so I have to ask, is it a little bit bittersweet to say, to not be part, to say goodbye to the Grant Theft Auto world and having to watch Grant Theft Auto six released? Or is it more excitement? Is it, what's the feeling?

I think it's a, it's, how would I describe it? Of course, it's all, all of the above. You know, it's, it's exactly as you, you know, pleased to be doing other stuff. Excited for what we're working on now. Super excited, of course, letting go of something. I've worked on it one way or another for like 20 odd years, you know, and, and, and wrote on them for the last 10 or 11 that came out. Wrote all of them, you know, lead writer and all them, whatever it was. So of course letting go of that is, you know, is a big, is a big change and, and a lot and, and, and, and sad in a way because it was, each of the games was a kind of standalone story. It's not quite the same as as I think probably it would be in some ways sadder if someone continued on Red Dead because it was a cohesive two game mark. That might be more sad to hear someone working on that. But again, not that, that will probably happen too. They're not, I don't own the ip. That was the sort of part of the, the, the deal. It's a privilege to work on stuff, but you don't necessarily own it.

Is it, when you're done with the game, does it always feel like a goodbye? Like when you say when you're done with Red Dead two is like you're saying goodbye to Arthur, like the characters you created, you're walking away, you

Kind of are. It's Arthur in the end of the game. Yeah. Even before the end of the game. Yeah. I think you've got, you know, I've been with them for seven, eight years and, and you have to kind of let it go or you can't Go to the next one. Yeah. So it was always this thing of, of okay, that's done. And sometimes people would ask me questions and I about older games and certainly when I was in the middle of making new ones in this, I couldn't really necessarily even remember. And I've got a pretty good memory normally because you kind of have to let it go. So I, it's, it's not, it, it's, you're so immersed in it and thinking about it and certainly in that last period, the last few months, you're really, really immersed in every little nuance and every little detail all of the time. And then you're just not thinking about it in the same way.

Yeah, it's funny from the player perspective, it feels like an old friend that I miss, whether it's John or Arthur or Nico, it's a real goodbye that's, there's a real sadness to finishing a video game. I hope so. Legitimately a sad, not just because the story is sad or because you've

Been with them so long. Yeah.

And it's a real goodbye to close it. There's that feeling when you're sort of close the video game and it's, I mean, it's like saying goodbye to a friend and

That's when you finish a book you love. Yeah. It's the same feeling, same feeling. And I think that was something that we really, in the early days, o of Rockstar really aspired to have that where people would have that. It wasn't just the mania of, of clearing a level, but the feeling of saying goodbye to characters. You know, I think that was something we really wanted to achieve in games that we didn't know was even possible. So to hear people say that is incredibly rewarding.

Yeah. The end of On the Road by Kerouac for lo rags of Grown Old, I just remember closing that thinking, what the fuck am I doing in this big world? It's a melancholic feeling, but there's nothing like that feeling. And you've achieved, it's so rare in video games to be able to achieve that with Red Dead. And for me it was Grand Theft Auto, A four with Nico. I had to ask about, in that 2018 interview, you talked about satirizing American culture, which I think Grand Theft Auto was trying to do. And you've made I think a really powerful observation that on the political front, people are getting more divided. It's getting more Absurd and ridiculous and extreme. So becoming harder and harder to satirize 'cause of how rapidly it's becoming ridiculous. You're talking about you don't even know if a grant Theft Auto six, if it's possible to satirize, because by the time you release the thing, it's already going to be outdated in terms of the, the satire will become reality essentially. First of all, it'd be nice to get your updated view on that. Second of all, it seems like you've answered your very own comment with American Caper, which seems to satirize American culture just fine in how much over the top it goes. Anyway, there's lots of questions in there.

"ut satirizing American culture, which I think Grand Theft Auto was trying to do. And you've made I think a really powerful observation that on the political front, people are getting more divided. It's getting more Absurd and ridiculous and extreme. So becoming harder and harder to satirize 'cause of how rapidly it's becoming ridiculous. You're talking about you don't even know if a grant Theft Auto six, if it's possible to satirize, because by the time you release the thing, it's already going to be outdated in terms of the, the satire will become reality essentially. First of all, it'd be nice to get your updated view on that. Second of all, it seems like you've answered your very own comment with American Caper, which seems to satirize American culture just fine in how much over the top it goes. Anyway, there's lots of questions in there.

One of the things we've enjoyed about doing a comic book is that we are, it still has lead times, but the lead times are not four or five years. The lead times are, you know, a year and we're putting, we can make little updates much, much newer. Yeah. And we're, you know, we're, we are just wrapping issue 10 of a, of a 12 issue arc for that. So it's not quite, it's not quite as difficult. You still can get the tone of it, but yeah, I think it's, I think it's an issue. Anyone trying to talk about this current era, which began in 20 15, 20 16 is going to have of, how do you characterize it when things move so quickly and so fast?

So American capers, first of all, epic comic book. I love it. The art.

Yeah, the art's. Beautiful. David Lapham is the artist. He did an amazing job. He is a, he is a wonderful, wonderful storyteller.

What made you set wanna set in Wyoming?

I hadn't seen a modern story there that I knew about. I started to spend a bit more time in the Rockies and in the West and I was like, I'd spent a lot of time in like the countryside in upstate New York and, and thought it never really captured it quite right. And just the idea of these places as they change, it didn't, it was a way of doing a crime story that didn't feel the same as a GTA. You know, it was not somewhere you would necessarily set a GTA, but it felt like it was really interesting and under-explored.

And there is over the top stuff, there's, there's, yeah,

It's definitely slightly over the

Top. So lemme take notes on this. There's a, a spoiler alert, I guess from the first issue. I believe there's a devout suburban Mormon who commits, I think serial murder with a shovel as a form of religious atonement.

He's not necessarily, you know, the sharpest tool in the box. And his, his his rather cynical boss is using his, his religion and some mistakes he's made to blackmail him into murdering business associates.

And of course there's this Shakespearean sort of two neighbors situation and each of them having a duality of who they are in terms of good and evil. So there's a Wall Street transplant who wants to be a cowboy. Yes. Who loves to manually harvest bull semen. Accurate. I mean, I'm, yes, this is the notes I've been taking. He

Is a, he is a somewhat confused, longevity obsessed right. Rich dude who's runaway to Wyoming and is living out an assortment of fantasies.

And bull seaman is a big component of longevity. Yes.

He's very into all the life hacking, you know, ro ro, HGH and and making money

And, and

Has lost his mind living on a big ranch.

Of course, on the theme of satire, there is a woman who sleeps in tactical gear and is consumed by online conspiracies, like especially pedophiles in DC

Yes. Based on someone I know who got completely red pilled and I was fascinated by the fact that this was happening to people.

Yeah. So, you know, satire of American culture. Quick pause, bathroom break. Sure. I think GTA five had the biggest launch in video game history and GTA six has the potential to topping that. First of all, do you think it will, and more broadly, what was your definition of success for a video game?

I would assume it will because it's so anticipated and anticipation is the best driver of early sales as we saw with GTA four versus Red Dead Redemption one, you know, GTA four pharma anticipated sold much better early on. So I would assume it will sell really well. That was never my definition of success, but you certainly wanted to make money. You know, you, you're spending someone's money. So the number one success is are you making that money back plus a dollar at, at some level. That has to be, that has to be the single most important thing. So you get to do it again. You know, you've got big teams of people, people need to pay the rent, you have to keep the lights on in the business so that you have to make a small profit if you think in that way that keeps you being creative. I think that was like trying to forget about that. Not really an option, but we almost always did that. We didn't quite always do that, but we almost always did that. I think the definition of success for me was, had we tried to do new things and done them or achieved some of our goals, that was the thing that I'm at. Were people responding to these worlds and these characters in a way that I wanted them to.

Is it crazy to you that video games are able to make billions of dollars when if you look at like the eighties and nineties, you know, nobody took video games seriously. And even in the Austin it, and now they're basically, I mean it's very possible if you look at 10, 20 years from now, that video games surpass film as a way to consume stories.

I think they've possibly already done that in some ways and certainly as an, as a business proposition, they've already done that. But I think that's not, you know, as a, as a way of telling stories, I think they're better at telling certain kinds of stories and films are better at other kinds of stories. You know, I think, I think if you want a long discursive adventure, a video game is better. If you want a short, tight experience, a film is better. We always felt games were the coming medium and so spent 20 years saying games of the future, games of the future and you know, being sneered at them, being laughed at them being, having people nod their heads and then it kind of happening. So I would, well, you know, at the same time, much as you might say something, you don't necessarily believe it's gonna be true, but it has become true. And I think still games are only gonna get better, more interesting, more creatively, you know, diverse.

You said that Red Dead Redemption two in your opinion is the best thing you've ever done. I think there's a strong case to be made that it's the Greatest game of all time. What are the elements that make that game truly great do you think?

I think you had an incredibly strong team working together that was very experienced, that had basically been in place since somewhere between 2001 and 2006. So it was a long experience team. I think we got to spend a smaller group of us working on it from day one coming up with some weird wacky ideas that we got to embed in the game and then we kind of had to follow through with that I think was helpful that we gotta be very creative before it had a full team on it. I think that the cowboy setting is great because it gives a sort of mythic seriousness that sometimes doing stuff in a contemporary setting doesn't allow, you know, I think the closest we got to that kind of seriousness was GTA four, but it just can't, once you're setting things in the modern world, they're too frenetic. You can't get some of that slightly, you know, operatic feel that. I love that that that some people think is maybe a little over the top. But I, I, you know, I love this kind of, you know, people searching for meaning within, amongst the violence. I think that the, the, the West and all of the themes around the west really lend itself to that. So I think that, and then the, the gunplay was fantastic and the horses were incredible. So I think you had this combination of kind of technical knowhow, a a very, very strong team and really strong material.

Where did you have to Go to, in your mind, maybe philosophical, maybe spiritually, to be able to create the RDR world? So of course it was based on Red Dead revolver, but that's Yes. That, that's a fundamentally different, I mean that leap into the great mythic story that was Red Dead Redemption one and then even more so Red Dead Redemption too, that was unlike anything you or maybe anyone has ever created in video games. Thank you. So like what drugs were involved?

No drugs. Okay. No, stop the, stop the drugs long before. Okay. That's why I did all that work. Had nothing else to do. So Open, Open World video games were very good for my mental health in that way. Kept me busy but red. So red I'll, I'll tell, I'll give you the, my version. The games are made by big teams. Yeah. So I, I will give you my human interest version of the story. From my perspective only we, we made Red Dead Revolver decided that, or finished Red Dead Revolver, that'd been a cap con game and they didn't wanna finish it. So we finished it and they released it in Japan and we released it in the US in I think 2004 and decided we would start work on open world cowboy game for PS three. Didn't think too much more about it. And that was when we had a bunch of other stuff to work on. And slowly 2005, 2006, the game started to come to life, began to meet with the lead designer, Christian essa and thrash out a few ideas and story ideas for, for the game and begin to think about some stuff and start thinking about, well, what works in open world game, what works for a cowboy game? And again, with being lazy or procrastinating,

Can we, just on a small tangent as when you mention you take notes when you're being lazy, what, what do those nodes look like? Are they like doodles?

They look like either either a yellow pad or a Blackberry in those days, or an iPhone in these days I'll write the subject matter and then just email myself a note, here's a good idea, a note or which might be scribbling on a pad. And then I'll assemble. If I, if they're done digitally, then I'll do, I'll, I'll assemble them into one long word file and then I'll look at them and go, you know, here's an idea, here's an idea, here's an idea. And see if it comes to anything. See if I now aggregate them together and then read through them, I, there's anything coherent there. You know, something like a character like this, a character like that, this would be a funny line. This is a line for the main character, actually make the main character work like this, you know, or what about this relationship? As you start to just play around with what about if we start in that place, Go to that place, start, just start to play around with all of the different bits and pieces. And we began to flesh out some flow for the start of the game. And this idea you'd start in Dusty American West, which meant we didn't have to make too many trees and then Go to Mexico and then come back and we had a sort of loose flow and I was really scared of writing any actual dialogue and I didn't have a clue how to go about it. And I, it'll come, it'll come. And then, and I kept, I could postpone if ages were doing GTA four and I kept worrying about it. And then gt my work was wrapped on four, but the game wasn't now yet. And we've done a bunch of the marketing stuff and I had a little window when I wasn't doing much else. And I took a week with my then girlfriend, now wife, who was heavily pregnant with our first child. And we went up to a house upstate and sat there in the, well she, she, she sat there either cooking for me or watching TV or eating. And I went and sat in the room all day, every day and just sat there and stared at the computer and tried to think about how can I do this that, it doesn't sound ridiculous. How can you write in, in, in a, in a cowboy idiom that feels both slightly contemporary but also gives the game this sort of life and this weight that I want it to have and think we can think we can get away with. And after about three days it just started to come and then suddenly I wrote about nine, 10 scenes in the next couple of days. And after I knew I had it and it was, dunno if it was, that was why there was so much about a character caring about his family because I was just beginning the process of having a family.

Oh see. So

I know, I don't know to what extent that bled in there, but I think it bled in there to some extent.

So that was part of the creating the 360 degree characters?

I think.

So here's this man that is capable as involved in a lot of violence, who's also cares about his family,

Is he's grown up and he is trying to step away from that and be, and be a man, be a grownup, and can he get away from it? And then, and then when he can't get away from it, what's he willing to do to save his family? Yeah. And that was, I felt, starting to get some idea, feeling just, I mean she hadn't given birth yet, but I was beginning to grapple with the ideas of I'm gonna become a parent. So I hope some of that, and obviously then it didn't, probably didn't write anymore for six months. So later on we had a, had a child. But, but certainly that first bit, I think some of that began to bleed in there.

You got the feeling that you can actually do it. It it's true. It's, it could have very easily been ridiculous and not believable. The the dialogue between cowboys. Yes. You, I mean there's probably so much work went into making it feel real and believable and, and like that, like, like a Shakespearian type of drama, but not the cheesy kind.

Well just wanted it to feel when they spoke. I mean I I love dialogue. I'm always, you know, I love the the sound of words, but just wanted to feel like when they sounded, it didn't sound cheesy, it didn't sound ridiculous, you wanted to hear 'em speak more. It didn't make you cringe awfully when they spoke, that was the some level that was all the goal was. And then they felt like this guy was gonna go on this life and death odyssey and you cared about him. You had to care about his wife and child that he left behind even though you didn't know them.

When did you know how you're going to end? Red Dead Redemption one,

I remember I did a meeting with Christian, the designer, I can't remember what year, probably some point late 2008, early 2009. And we were discussing the last bit and, and and said I think he's gotta die. And he leapt on the idea and went That's yeah. Yes, yes. And then I went, no, it can't work. Games can't work like that. They can't work if he's dead. And then I began to think through, well if we just, technically it doesn't work because you have to be able to finish all the stuff up and then began to think through, actually I think we can make it work if we do it this way. And so he then really pushed for that idea. And it seemed to, I was like, ah, I was still torn. I thought it was clever narratively, but I was torn if it was gonna work technically as a piece of game design. But I think it did.

Yeah. And spoiler alert of course. How do we tell the story of that? Well, so he goes through a lot. He does all the, John does all the dirty work of hunting down his old gang and he finally is able to go home and be with his family, be on the ranch and then the government betrays him and sends troops to, to kill him. And, and there is dialogue. I mean that is just, I think the two times I shed a tear in video game history for me is that dialogue. I think John talking to his wife, if I vaguely remember, I think he said, I love you, but he said very li he didn't, he made it seem like he's going to see her and his son shortly. That dialogue was massively done. Like a definition of like less is more. It was just so crisp. That, and of course the other one is again from memory, Arthur riding his horse and the music is playing. It's very hard not to shatter a tear during that.",,,"Dan Houser is co-founder of Rockstar Games and is a legendary creative mind behind Grand Theft Auto (GTA) and Red Dead Redemption series of video games.

"ut satirizing American culture, which I think Grand Theft Auto was trying to do. And you've made I think a really powerful observation that on the political front, people are getting more divided. It's getting more Absurd and ridiculous and extreme. So becoming harder and harder to satirize 'cause of how rapidly it's becoming ridiculous. You're talking about you don't even know if a grant Theft Auto six, if it's possible to satirize, because by the time you release the thing, it's already going to be outdated in terms of the, the satire will become reality essentially. First of all, it'd be nice to get your updated view on that. Second of all, it seems like you've answered your very own comment with American Caper, which seems to satirize American culture just fine in how much over the top it goes. Anyway, there's lots of questions in there.

One of the things we've enjoyed about doing a comic book is that we are, it still has lead times, but the lead times are not four or five years. The lead times are, you know, a year and we're putting, we can make little updates much, much newer. Yeah. And we're, you know, we're, we are just wrapping issue 10 of a, of a 12 issue arc for that. So it's not quite, it's not quite as difficult. You still can get the tone of it, but yeah, I think it's, I think it's an issue. Anyone trying to talk about this current era, which began in 20 15, 20 16 is going to have of, how do you characterize it when things move so quickly and so fast?

So American capers, first of all, epic comic book. I love it. The art.

Yeah, the art's. Beautiful. David Lapham is the artist. He did an amazing job. He is a, he is a wonderful, wonderful storyteller.

What made you set wanna set in Wyoming?

I hadn't seen a modern story there that I knew about. I started to spend a bit more time in the Rockies and in the West and I was like, I'd spent a lot of time in like the countryside in upstate New York and, and thought it never really captured it quite right. And just the idea of these places as they change, it didn't, it was a way of doing a crime story that didn't feel the same as a GTA. You know, it was not somewhere you would necessarily set a GTA, but it felt like it was really interesting and under-explored.

And there is over the top stuff, there's, there's, yeah,

It's definitely slightly over the

Top. So lemme take notes on this. There's a, a spoiler alert, I guess from the first issue. I believe there's a devout suburban Mormon who commits, I think serial murder with a shovel as a form of religious atonement.

He's not necessarily, you know, the sharpest tool in the box. And his, his his rather cynical boss is using his, his religion and some mistakes he's made to blackmail him into murdering business associates.

And of course there's this Shakespearean sort of two neighbors situation and each of them having a duality of who they are in terms of good and evil. So there's a Wall Street transplant who wants to be a cowboy. Yes. Who loves to manually harvest bull semen. Accurate. I mean, I'm, yes, this is the notes I've been taking. He

Is a, he is a somewhat confused, longevity obsessed right. Rich dude who's runaway to Wyoming and is living out an assortment of fantasies.

And bull seaman is a big component of longevity. Yes.

He's very into all the life hacking, you know, ro ro, HGH and and making money

And, and

Has lost his mind living on a big ranch.

Of course, on the theme of satire, there is a woman who sleeps in tactical gear and is consumed by online conspiracies, like especially pedophiles in DC

Yes. Based on someone I know who got completely red pilled and I was fascinated by the fact that this was happening to people.

Yeah. So, you know, satire of American culture. Quick pause, bathroom break. Sure. I think GTA five had the biggest launch in video game history and GTA six has the potential to topping that. First of all, do you think it will, and more broadly, what was your definition of success for a video game?

I would assume it will because it's so anticipated and anticipation is the best driver of early sales as we saw with GTA four versus Red Dead Redemption one, you know, GTA four pharma anticipated sold much better early on. So I would assume it will sell really well. That was never my definition of success, but you certainly wanted to make money. You know, you, you're spending someone's money. So the number one success is are you making that money back plus a dollar at, at some level. That has to be, that has to be the single most important thing. So you get to do it again. You know, you've got big teams of people, people need to pay the rent, you have to keep the lights on in the business so that you have to make a small profit if you think in that way that keeps you being creative. I think that was like trying to forget about that. Not really an option, but we almost always did that. We didn't quite always do that, but we almost always did that. I think the definition of success for me was, had we tried to do new things and done them or achieved some of our goals, that was the thing that I'm at. Were people responding to these worlds and these characters in a way that I wanted them to.

Is it crazy to you that video games are able to make billions of dollars when if you look at like the eighties and nineties, you know, nobody took video games seriously. And even in the Austin it, and now they're basically, I mean it's very possible if you look at 10, 20 years from now, that video games surpass film as a way to consume stories.

I think they've possibly already done that in some ways and certainly as an, as a business proposition, they've already done that. But I think that's not, you know, as a, as a way of telling stories, I think they're better at telling certain kinds of stories and films are better at other kinds of stories. You know, I think, I think if you want a long discursive adventure, a video game is better. If you want a short, tight experience, a film is better. We always felt games were the coming medium and so spent 20 years saying games of the future, games of the future and you know, being sneered at them, being laughed at them being, having people nod their heads and then it kind of happening. So I would, well, you know, at the same time, much as you might say something, you don't necessarily believe it's gonna be true, but it has become true. And I think still games are only gonna get better, more interesting, more creatively, you know, diverse.

You said that Red Dead Redemption two in your opinion is the best thing you've ever done. I think there's a strong case to be made that it's the Greatest game of all time. What are the elements that make that game truly great do you think?

I think you had an incredibly strong team working together that was very experienced, that had basically been in place since somewhere between 2001 and 2006. So it was a long experience team. I think we got to spend a smaller group of us working on it from day one coming up with some weird wacky ideas that we got to embed in the game and then we kind of had to follow through with that I think was helpful that we gotta be very creative before it had a full team on it. I think that the cowboy setting is great because it gives a sort of mythic seriousness that sometimes doing stuff in a contemporary setting doesn't allow, you know, I think the closest we got to that kind of seriousness was GTA four, but it just can't, once you're setting things in the modern world, they're too frenetic. You can't get some of that slightly, you know, operatic feel that. I love that that that some people think is maybe a little over the top. But I, I, you know, I love this kind of, you know, people searching for meaning within, amongst the violence. I think that the, the, the West and all of the themes around the west really lend itself to that. So I think that, and then the, the gunplay was fantastic and the horses were incredible. So I think you had this combination of kind of technical knowhow, a a very, very strong team and really strong material.

Where did you have to Go to, in your mind, maybe philosophical, maybe spiritually, to be able to create the RDR world? So of course it was based on Red Dead revolver, but that's Yes. That, that's a fundamentally different, I mean that leap into the great mythic story that was Red Dead Redemption one and then even more so Red Dead Redemption too, that was unlike anything you or maybe anyone has ever created in video games. Thank you. So like what drugs were involved?

No drugs. Okay. No, stop the, stop the drugs long before. Okay. That's why I did all that work. Had nothing else to do. So Open, Open World video games were very good for my mental health in that way. Kept me busy but red. So red I'll, I'll tell, I'll give you the, my version. The games are made by big teams. Yeah. So I, I will give you my human interest version of the story. From my perspective only we, we made Red Dead Revolver decided that, or finished Red Dead Revolver, that'd been a cap con game and they didn't wanna finish it. So we finished it and they released it in Japan and we released it in the US in I think 2004 and decided we would start work on open world cowboy game for PS three. Didn't think too much more about it. And that was when we had a bunch of other stuff to work on. And slowly 2005, 2006, the game started to come to life, began to meet with the lead designer, Christian essa and thrash out a few ideas and story ideas for, for the game and begin to think about some stuff and start thinking about, well, what works in open world game, what works for a cowboy game? And again, with being lazy or procrastinating,

Can we, just on a small tangent as when you mention you take notes when you're being lazy, what, what do those nodes look like? Are they like doodles?

They look like either either a yellow pad or a Blackberry in those days, or an iPhone in these days I'll write the subject matter and then just email myself a note, here's a good idea, a note or which might be scribbling on a pad. And then I'll assemble. If I, if they're done digitally, then I'll do, I'll, I'll assemble them into one long word file and then I'll look at them and go, you know, here's an idea, here's an idea, here's an idea. And see if it comes to anything. See if I now aggregate them together and then read through them, I, there's anything coherent there. You know, something like a character like this, a character like that, this would be a funny line. This is a line for the main character, actually make the main character work like this, you know, or what about this relationship? As you start to just play around with what about if we start in that place, Go to that place, start, just start to play around with all of the different bits and pieces. And we began to flesh out some flow for the start of the game. And this idea you'd start in Dusty American West, which meant we didn't have to make too many trees and then Go to Mexico and then come back and we had a sort of loose flow and I was really scared of writing any actual dialogue and I didn't have a clue how to go about it. And I, it'll come, it'll come. And then, and I kept, I could postpone if ages were doing GTA four and I kept worrying about it. And then gt my work was wrapped on four, but the game wasn't now yet. And we've done a bunch of the marketing stuff and I had a little window when I wasn't doing much else. And I took a week with my then girlfriend, now wife, who was heavily pregnant with our first child. And we went up to a house upstate and sat there in the, well she, she, she sat there either cooking for me or watching TV or eating. And I went and sat in the room all day, every day and just sat there and stared at the computer and tried to think about how can I do this that, it doesn't sound ridiculous. How can you write in, in, in a, in a cowboy idiom that feels both slightly contemporary but also gives the game this sort of life and this weight that I want it to have and think we can think we can get away with. And after about three days it just started to come and then suddenly I wrote about nine, 10 scenes in the next couple of days. And after I knew I had it and it was, dunno if it was, that was why there was so much about a character caring about his family because I was just beginning the process of having a family.

Oh see. So

I know, I don't know to what extent that bled in there, but I think it bled in there to some extent.

So that was part of the creating the 360 degree characters?

I think.

So here's this man that is capable as involved in a lot of violence, who's also cares about his family,

Is he's grown up and he is trying to step away from that and be, and be a man, be a grownup, and can he get away from it? And then, and then when he can't get away from it, what's he willing to do to save his family? Yeah. And that was, I felt, starting to get some idea, feeling just, I mean she hadn't given birth yet, but I was beginning to grapple with the ideas of I'm gonna become a parent. So I hope some of that, and obviously then it didn't, probably didn't write anymore for six months. So later on we had a, had a child. But, but certainly that first bit, I think some of that began to bleed in there.

You got the feeling that you can actually do it. It it's true. It's, it could have very easily been ridiculous and not believable. The the dialogue between cowboys. Yes. You, I mean there's probably so much work went into making it feel real and believable and, and like that, like, like a Shakespearian type of drama, but not the cheesy kind.

Well just wanted it to feel when they spoke. I mean I I love dialogue. I'm always, you know, I love the the sound of words, but just wanted to feel like when they sounded, it didn't sound cheesy, it didn't sound ridiculous, you wanted to hear 'em speak more. It didn't make you cringe awfully when they spoke, that was the some level that was all the goal was. And then they felt like this guy was gonna go on this life and death odyssey and you cared about him. You had to care about his wife and child that he left behind even though you didn't know them.

When did you know how you're going to end? Red Dead Redemption one,

I remember I did a meeting with Christian, the designer, I can't remember what year, probably some point late 2008, early 2009. And we were discussing the last bit and, and and said I think he's gotta die. And he leapt on the idea and went That's yeah. Yes, yes. And then I went, no, it can't work. Games can't work like that. They can't work if he's dead. And then I began to think through, well if we just, technically it doesn't work because you have to be able to finish all the stuff up and then began to think through, actually I think we can make it work if we do it this way. And so he then really pushed for that idea. And it seemed to, I was like, ah, I was still torn. I thought it was clever narratively, but I was torn if it was gonna work technically as a piece of game design. But I think it did.

Yeah. And spoiler alert of course. How do we tell the story of that? Well, so he goes through a lot. He does all the, John does all the dirty work of hunting down his old gang and he finally is able to go home and be with his family, be on the ranch and then the government betrays him and sends troops to, to kill him. And, and there is dialogue. I mean that is just, I think the two times I shed a tear in video game history for me is that dialogue. I think John talking to his wife, if I vaguely remember, I think he said, I love you, but he said very li he didn't, he made it seem like he's going to see her and his son shortly. That dialogue was massively done. Like a definition of like less is more. It was just so crisp. That, and of course the other one is again from memory, Arthur riding his horse and the music is playing. It's very hard not to shatter a tear during that.",,,"Dan Houser is co-founder of Rockstar Games and is a legendary creative mind behind Grand Theft Auto (GTA) and Red Dead Redemption series of video games.

"lever narratively, but I was torn if it was gonna work technically as a piece of game design. But I think it did.

Yeah. And spoiler alert of course. How do we tell the story of that? Well, so he goes through a lot. He does all the, John does all the dirty work of hunting down his old gang and he finally is able to go home and be with his family, be on the ranch and then the government betrays him and sends troops to, to kill him. And, and there is dialogue. I mean that is just, I think the two times I shed a tear in video game history for me is that dialogue. I think John talking to his wife, if I vaguely remember, I think he said, I love you, but he said very li he didn't, he made it seem like he's going to see her and his son shortly. That dialogue was massively done. Like a definition of like less is more. It was just so crisp. That, and of course the other one is again from memory, Arthur riding his horse and the music is playing. It's very hard not to shatter a tear during that. Anyway, the dialogue of John talking to his wife at, at the end when he's in a barn and he is about to walk out to face certain death. Do you remember writing that?

Oh yeah, yeah. But it does, again, I went, I the actor was so good and we, we seen a bunch of his work by then. Yeah. He had such a good, he was so good at reading those lines that I knew he could give us, that you could feel with that point. Like I think those lines are best when they're really short and punchy it. And so got, I knew he'd be able to make that line sound good.

So you were imagining his voice. Yeah. You understood.

And, and, and I think all of those actors on, on on Red Dead Redemption one were so strong that they really bought that game to life. If they them and Rod, the director hadn't done a such, such a good job. It would've sounded cheesy as hell.

Yeah. You've said that the ending of that ending of RDR one is one of the best things you've been a part of creating. Why, why, why is, why is that ending so powerful to you? What does it represent?

I think because for the story to work, I mean just from a, from a technical challenge for the story to work, he had to die. But for a game to work, it felt like a challenge to make him die. It was probably the four fifth or sixth open world game I'd worked on. And I'd, you know, spent all these years before that working out how these stories worked, how to make them work technically, how to make them feel right. How they interacted with the open form gameplay as best I could. And suddenly we're gonna break one of our golden rules, which was at the end of the game, you are free in the character to go and wrap up all the side stories to play forever. We're not gonna, you're not gonna be able to do that in this game 'cause the guy's gonna be dead and we're gonna have to have you play as a different character. And the the narrative is, is gonna be if we've done a good job compelling enough where you're not gonna care about that and or you're gonna be upset that he's dead, but you're gonna actually have this emotional moment. So I think it was a big risk from a technical perspective for us to do that. And then it worked. So I think that was something that was very full of fear and it put, and it worked, it worked out okay and think people were really upset and angry at us for doing it because I think it was gonna happen. But I think they also had that kind of experience you are describing. It was that kind of creative moment where, you know, transcendent moment with, with characters in a piece of fiction, which is what we've always aspired to giving people.

I mean, it's incredible because I don't think I, I don't remember a single video game that has done that before. Well,

I would like to have at the end of GTA four kill Nico, but you couldn't do it. You know, the game doesn't work. So it was this thing where we hadn't done it, thought about doing it, hadn't done it, and then going, let's do it. Let's, let's take the risk and do it. We can't do it. Let's try it. Try and it and it worked.

Yeah. What about the decision with the son? You know, John give so much effort to make sure that Jack doesn't end up in a life of violence. And then it, I mean it's very godfather alike. It's, yeah, he's dragged back into it through revenge.

That was also the game still had to work as a game. Whether that was the right ending, a hundred percent the best ending from a pure storytelling perspective, I don't know. But I know that we had to make the game work. Oh, interesting. So it was, I think it was, I think it kind of worked in that way where, where Jack can't escape. But I always also wanted a version of it where Jack did escape, but that wasn't, you know, it, it both were interesting to me.

Can you just dig in a little deeper? Like what do you mean? But for the game to work, it's, it's such a direct, it's like a Cooper talking about for this movie to work, it has to have, 'cause from my perspective, I just think about the story. What what's the technical aspect of for the game

Work? It's just me. You know, the mechanical experience is you have an avatar, you control and you, you, you know, the games don't really end and you have to be able to wander around the world and do stuff. So at the end of the game, you have to be able to wander around with your fairly limited set of features, which is you can, you know, run up to someone and punch them or run up to someone and shoot them or run up to someone and rob them or run up to someone and talk to them and, and that's kind and or run up, you know, jump on a horse or, or or do all this other stuff in order for the game store to be fun and people to get this full 360 degree experience with it. They had to, you know, a hundred if they wanted a hundred percent the game as opposed to just finishing the story, you have to have an avatar to do that stuff with. So that was, that was the sort of challenge of, of Jack's character slash wrapping up the story as Jack,

Oh, there's real power for the avatar to end the finiteness.

Yeah. Both the Red Deads, you obviously change Avatar, which we got, you know, and then did it again. I, I think there's something interesting about that moment when you change from one character to another because they are you and they're not you, you know, and then there's suddenly someone else.

I mean, I was really shaken by that experience, but it's a, it's a beautiful experience. It's like an unforgettable experience and that, what else can video games possibly reach for? You know, it's the, to create that experience. That's what great films do. That's what great, great great books do. It's

That, I mean it's that and the world building in games. I think the experience of being in this fake place and then taken on these narrative adventures, when that combines, you've got the amazing experience.

So who do you think is the best character you've ever created in RDR? So to me, I think definitively Arthur from Red Dead Redemption Two is the best character ever created in video games ever. I, I think there's not even clo I mean John will be the second, which is hilarious to say, but like tho those are, John will be a close second. But Arthur is definitively, and you, you've talked about, and in that interview you said that a lot of video games work on the same premise that you start as a weak person and end up as a strong superhero. But what if you start as a tough guy, someone who already is very strong, someone that's emotionally confident of his place in the world. Arthur's journey is not about becoming a superhero because he's almost one at the start, but it's about an intellectual rollercoaster when his worldview gets taken apart. So it's, it's, it's very different than the normal journey of a character.

Yeah. In a game.

In a game. Wanted to

Reverse it. Yeah. So there were a couple other themes that matched that. So there are guys from the Wild West, but they're being pushed ever further east. So it was almost like an anti-Western and Eastern, you're traveling east, you're traveling into civilization. And I, I don't think I would've been grappling with those ideas earlier in my career. 'cause it was, you know, idea of getting, getting a different kind of strength and a different kind of weakness was interesting.

What about the component of Mortality of a character facing his own Mortality over a prolonged period? Sort of just realize the, the, the prospect of like real sort of fear of death, realization of death.

Yeah. I thought that was really, it's

Part of the story.

Really fun thing to play with. John dies in Red Dead One and wanted to top that Red Dead two or do do that in a different way. And so the idea that it's John's death is fairly sudden. And so if he's got this long drawn out death, and then I'd always been obsessed by TB as diseases go, it's a great literary device, you know, 'cause it is this long drawn out slow death, but in which you are also getting weaker. And my grandfather actually had TB before they invented antibiotics and was sent to a sanatorium just after he was, just after he'd had his child, my father and survived. But only three of them out of like 35 survived. So I was always captivated and, and by TB as an illness, it felt like it was an interesting thing to play around with as an idea. This, this guy getting weaker who felt like he was immortal and essentially was immortal. He was the protagonist in a video game. He could not die and suddenly he's becoming mortal and, and you know, but that helps him see stuff. I thought that was a different way of doing a, a lead character in a game.

Yeah. Do you think it's the, the greatest character we ever created?

I think he's the best lead character. You know, the lead characters are different from the side characters and I think he's the, he's the most round rounded and works the best. I kind of, him and Nico are the two I like, you know, they were the two most ambitious. Yeah. So for me it's always, it's always sort of a toss up, you know? But then I loved all the stuff like the, the, the art team did such an amazing job. It was there with the journal and that kind of stuff, the way that all the features worked into Arthur's character. I thought that was really, he was really rounded. He worked in a, in lots of different ways. Really. Well I loved like his flawed relationship with his old girlfriend, things like that. All the side, you know, the bits that kind of turned up around him.

So you also like the side characters. You like the, the flavor, the Yeah, of course. Of the, the full cast. What are, what are some of the favorites you've created? I'm, I'm sure the one you're currently working on. Nigel Dave, that's a, you called him a psych character.

Well, he's not a protagonist. He's like a, he's a god not a character. Sure. So he's not him. I'm enjoying, I love Dutch, you know, it was partly because we wrote a few lines for him for the first game. And the actor did such a, a such an amazing job that when he spoke, it just came to me. All of their backstory, which I'd been playing around with by that point anyway, a little bit in my head. But I knew it was this bigger gang stuff and then I sort of saw exactly who he was. And so that was, that, that felt like he, he felt like a living character to me.

And we should say that Dutch is kind of like maybe a little bit of a God-like figure Yeah. In both of the Red Dead Redemption games and he's the leader of the gang. And there's a father son relationship with, with Dutch, with the, I mean with Arthur, with John, I mean there's, there's a family feeling to the gang that you explore all of those dynamics and then the feeling of betrayal and Arthur facing tuberculosis, you're going against the family, going against the father because he is transforming his sense of the world, of morality, of all those kinds of things. So all the kind of very Shakespearean dramas right there. And Dutch is a prominent godlike figure through all of that. Also flawed himself, also a man of good and evil in that framework that they're operating under.

And he, he's just drowning in his ego at the end. Yeah. You know, his ego gets the better of him. I think he's a but he, but there was something flawed but beautiful in his idealism when he was younger and that's mostly off camera, but, and then you're, you know, always been as an individual, I've always been very susceptible to charming people and he's charming. And so I always kind of, I can see how people get captivated by charming people. And, and the idea of here was a, a very charming person and the roads run out for him.

I personally am afraid of how much I love human beings and how susceptible I am to charm and charisma. Yeah. 'cause it can cause your judgment about human nature completely.

And that's what he, that's what's happened with him. And it, he ended up clouding his judgment about himself. He kind of fell for his own rubbish.

Yeah. But also it clouded Arthur's judgment. Oh completely.

Arthur was completely, you know, platonically in love with him. He was worshiping him, he'd given up his power to him. And then I think for Arthur, the journey is retaking that power in the moment of dying. You know, that's what the whole, that's what I thought that was really interesting.

Yeah. It's truly tragic for Arthur to be losing his identity, lifelong identity and the sense of belonging and losing his life at the same time in facing the Mortality. He is realizing that he's not, not all of it has been a lie,

But he gets to do some, well it depends on what the choices you make. Yeah. But he gets to do some good. Yes. And so he, you know, he gets his moment of redemption

Just a little bit. But realizing your whole life, you've been living not a good life. Yes. You've been not a good man.

Isn't that what we're all afraid of?

I guess it's never too late to change your voice. So the biggest, most important question, primary central to the reason we're talking today, the number one question from the internet, it is so ridiculous. But I must asked, have you seen Gavin? Who is Gavin? So for more context, there's a guy named Nigel in Red Dead Redemption two who's frantically searching for a mystery man named Gavin throughout the game. This has become one of the biggest mysteries amongst the interwebs, the RDR fan base. So the theories include theory one is it's a split personality disorder. Nigel himself is Gavin. So the evidence is the letter for this theory that has some evidence that may be due to trauma. The Split personality disorder was created, this Gavin was created inside Nigel's mind. Theory two is Gavin is dead and Nigel is simply in denial. Theory three is that it's just a troll and Rockstar intentionally created an unsolvable mystery to drive players crazy. I also heard theory four is Gavin is the strange man. So there's this fascinating character, the Strange Man, this supernatural character that has a presence in RDR one and a little bit in RDR two also. Yeah. So, which, which theory is closest to the truth?

Not three or four, somewhere in my mind. Somewhere between one and two. Yeah. I, I, I just love the way he shouted Gavin. It just amused me. So at some level it probably is trolling in that we didn't want it to be a totally clear mystery. You wanted it to have a little bit of adventure to it, but it was meant to be, without ever fully being explained that Gavin's not there anymore. Gavin's either gone home, Gavin's left him Gavin's and we were gonna keep exploring that idea he was gonna reappear in some way or other. Did you

Have any idea how much imagination, excitement and curiosity, that little interaction would inspire people?

Yes and no. I mean, no, you never know what people are gonna find amusing in these big games. And a lot of it comes down to acting as well. The guy was just funny when he said Gavin. Yeah. It was just funny. Yeah.",,,"Dan Houser is co-founder of Rockstar Games and is a legendary creative mind behind Grand Theft Auto (GTA) and Red Dead Redemption series of video games.

"lever narratively, but I was torn if it was gonna work technically as a piece of game design. But I think it did.

Yeah. And spoiler alert of course. How do we tell the story of that? Well, so he goes through a lot. He does all the, John does all the dirty work of hunting down his old gang and he finally is able to go home and be with his family, be on the ranch and then the government betrays him and sends troops to, to kill him. And, and there is dialogue. I mean that is just, I think the two times I shed a tear in video game history for me is that dialogue. I think John talking to his wife, if I vaguely remember, I think he said, I love you, but he said very li he didn't, he made it seem like he's going to see her and his son shortly. That dialogue was massively done. Like a definition of like less is more. It was just so crisp. That, and of course the other one is again from memory, Arthur riding his horse and the music is playing. It's very hard not to shatter a tear during that. Anyway, the dialogue of John talking to his wife at, at the end when he's in a barn and he is about to walk out to face certain death. Do you remember writing that?

Oh yeah, yeah. But it does, again, I went, I the actor was so good and we, we seen a bunch of his work by then. Yeah. He had such a good, he was so good at reading those lines that I knew he could give us, that you could feel with that point. Like I think those lines are best when they're really short and punchy it. And so got, I knew he'd be able to make that line sound good.

So you were imagining his voice. Yeah. You understood.

And, and, and I think all of those actors on, on on Red Dead Redemption one were so strong that they really bought that game to life. If they them and Rod, the director hadn't done a such, such a good job. It would've sounded cheesy as hell.

Yeah. You've said that the ending of that ending of RDR one is one of the best things you've been a part of creating. Why, why, why is, why is that ending so powerful to you? What does it represent?

I think because for the story to work, I mean just from a, from a technical challenge for the story to work, he had to die. But for a game to work, it felt like a challenge to make him die. It was probably the four fifth or sixth open world game I'd worked on. And I'd, you know, spent all these years before that working out how these stories worked, how to make them work technically, how to make them feel right. How they interacted with the open form gameplay as best I could. And suddenly we're gonna break one of our golden rules, which was at the end of the game, you are free in the character to go and wrap up all the side stories to play forever. We're not gonna, you're not gonna be able to do that in this game 'cause the guy's gonna be dead and we're gonna have to have you play as a different character. And the the narrative is, is gonna be if we've done a good job compelling enough where you're not gonna care about that and or you're gonna be upset that he's dead, but you're gonna actually have this emotional moment. So I think it was a big risk from a technical perspective for us to do that. And then it worked. So I think that was something that was very full of fear and it put, and it worked, it worked out okay and think people were really upset and angry at us for doing it because I think it was gonna happen. But I think they also had that kind of experience you are describing. It was that kind of creative moment where, you know, transcendent moment with, with characters in a piece of fiction, which is what we've always aspired to giving people.

I mean, it's incredible because I don't think I, I don't remember a single video game that has done that before. Well,

I would like to have at the end of GTA four kill Nico, but you couldn't do it. You know, the game doesn't work. So it was this thing where we hadn't done it, thought about doing it, hadn't done it, and then going, let's do it. Let's, let's take the risk and do it. We can't do it. Let's try it. Try and it and it worked.

Yeah. What about the decision with the son? You know, John give so much effort to make sure that Jack doesn't end up in a life of violence. And then it, I mean it's very godfather alike. It's, yeah, he's dragged back into it through revenge.

That was also the game still had to work as a game. Whether that was the right ending, a hundred percent the best ending from a pure storytelling perspective, I don't know. But I know that we had to make the game work. Oh, interesting. So it was, I think it was, I think it kind of worked in that way where, where Jack can't escape. But I always also wanted a version of it where Jack did escape, but that wasn't, you know, it, it both were interesting to me.

Can you just dig in a little deeper? Like what do you mean? But for the game to work, it's, it's such a direct, it's like a Cooper talking about for this movie to work, it has to have, 'cause from my perspective, I just think about the story. What what's the technical aspect of for the game

Work? It's just me. You know, the mechanical experience is you have an avatar, you control and you, you, you know, the games don't really end and you have to be able to wander around the world and do stuff. So at the end of the game, you have to be able to wander around with your fairly limited set of features, which is you can, you know, run up to someone and punch them or run up to someone and shoot them or run up to someone and rob them or run up to someone and talk to them and, and that's kind and or run up, you know, jump on a horse or, or or do all this other stuff in order for the game store to be fun and people to get this full 360 degree experience with it. They had to, you know, a hundred if they wanted a hundred percent the game as opposed to just finishing the story, you have to have an avatar to do that stuff with. So that was, that was the sort of challenge of, of Jack's character slash wrapping up the story as Jack,

Oh, there's real power for the avatar to end the finiteness.

Yeah. Both the Red Deads, you obviously change Avatar, which we got, you know, and then did it again. I, I think there's something interesting about that moment when you change from one character to another because they are you and they're not you, you know, and then there's suddenly someone else.

I mean, I was really shaken by that experience, but it's a, it's a beautiful experience. It's like an unforgettable experience and that, what else can video games possibly reach for? You know, it's the, to create that experience. That's what great films do. That's what great, great great books do. It's

That, I mean it's that and the world building in games. I think the experience of being in this fake place and then taken on these narrative adventures, when that combines, you've got the amazing experience.

So who do you think is the best character you've ever created in RDR? So to me, I think definitively Arthur from Red Dead Redemption Two is the best character ever created in video games ever. I, I think there's not even clo I mean John will be the second, which is hilarious to say, but like tho those are, John will be a close second. But Arthur is definitively, and you, you've talked about, and in that interview you said that a lot of video games work on the same premise that you start as a weak person and end up as a strong superhero. But what if you start as a tough guy, someone who already is very strong, someone that's emotionally confident of his place in the world. Arthur's journey is not about becoming a superhero because he's almost one at the start, but it's about an intellectual rollercoaster when his worldview gets taken apart. So it's, it's, it's very different than the normal journey of a character.

Yeah. In a game.

In a game. Wanted to

Reverse it. Yeah. So there were a couple other themes that matched that. So there are guys from the Wild West, but they're being pushed ever further east. So it was almost like an anti-Western and Eastern, you're traveling east, you're traveling into civilization. And I, I don't think I would've been grappling with those ideas earlier in my career. 'cause it was, you know, idea of getting, getting a different kind of strength and a different kind of weakness was interesting.

What about the component of Mortality of a character facing his own Mortality over a prolonged period? Sort of just realize the, the, the prospect of like real sort of fear of death, realization of death.

Yeah. I thought that was really, it's

Part of the story.

Really fun thing to play with. John dies in Red Dead One and wanted to top that Red Dead two or do do that in a different way. And so the idea that it's John's death is fairly sudden. And so if he's got this long drawn out death, and then I'd always been obsessed by TB as diseases go, it's a great literary device, you know, 'cause it is this long drawn out slow death, but in which you are also getting weaker. And my grandfather actually had TB before they invented antibiotics and was sent to a sanatorium just after he was, just after he'd had his child, my father and survived. But only three of them out of like 35 survived. So I was always captivated and, and by TB as an illness, it felt like it was an interesting thing to play around with as an idea. This, this guy getting weaker who felt like he was immortal and essentially was immortal. He was the protagonist in a video game. He could not die and suddenly he's becoming mortal and, and you know, but that helps him see stuff. I thought that was a different way of doing a, a lead character in a game.

Yeah. Do you think it's the, the greatest character we ever created?

I think he's the best lead character. You know, the lead characters are different from the side characters and I think he's the, he's the most round rounded and works the best. I kind of, him and Nico are the two I like, you know, they were the two most ambitious. Yeah. So for me it's always, it's always sort of a toss up, you know? But then I loved all the stuff like the, the, the art team did such an amazing job. It was there with the journal and that kind of stuff, the way that all the features worked into Arthur's character. I thought that was really, he was really rounded. He worked in a, in lots of different ways. Really. Well I loved like his flawed relationship with his old girlfriend, things like that. All the side, you know, the bits that kind of turned up around him.

So you also like the side characters. You like the, the flavor, the Yeah, of course. Of the, the full cast. What are, what are some of the favorites you've created? I'm, I'm sure the one you're currently working on. Nigel Dave, that's a, you called him a psych character.

Well, he's not a protagonist. He's like a, he's a god not a character. Sure. So he's not him. I'm enjoying, I love Dutch, you know, it was partly because we wrote a few lines for him for the first game. And the actor did such a, a such an amazing job that when he spoke, it just came to me. All of their backstory, which I'd been playing around with by that point anyway, a little bit in my head. But I knew it was this bigger gang stuff and then I sort of saw exactly who he was. And so that was, that, that felt like he, he felt like a living character to me.

And we should say that Dutch is kind of like maybe a little bit of a God-like figure Yeah. In both of the Red Dead Redemption games and he's the leader of the gang. And there's a father son relationship with, with Dutch, with the, I mean with Arthur, with John, I mean there's, there's a family feeling to the gang that you explore all of those dynamics and then the feeling of betrayal and Arthur facing tuberculosis, you're going against the family, going against the father because he is transforming his sense of the world, of morality, of all those kinds of things. So all the kind of very Shakespearean dramas right there. And Dutch is a prominent godlike figure through all of that. Also flawed himself, also a man of good and evil in that framework that they're operating under.

And he, he's just drowning in his ego at the end. Yeah. You know, his ego gets the better of him. I think he's a but he, but there was something flawed but beautiful in his idealism when he was younger and that's mostly off camera, but, and then you're, you know, always been as an individual, I've always been very susceptible to charming people and he's charming.

Just a little bit. But realizing your whole life, you've been living not a good life. Yes. You've been not a good man.

It was that kind of creative moment where, you know, transcendent moment with, with characters in a piece of fiction, which is what we've always aspired to giving people.

I mean, it's incredible because I don't think I, I don't remember a single video game that has done that before. Well,

I would like to have at the end of GTA four kill Nico, but you couldn't do it. You know, the game doesn't work. So it was this thing where we hadn't done it, thought about doing it, hadn't done it, and then going, let's do it. Let's, let's take the risk and do it. We can't do it. Let's try it. Try and it and it worked.

Yeah. What about the decision with the son? You know, John give so much effort to make sure that Jack doesn't end up in a life of violence. And then it, I mean it's very godfather alike. It's, yeah, he's dragged back into it through revenge.

That was also the game still had to work as a game. Whether that was the right ending, a hundred percent the best ending from a pure storytelling perspective, I don't know. But I know that we had to make the game work. Oh, interesting. So it was, I think it was, I think it kind of worked in that way where, where Jack can't escape. But I always also wanted a version of it where Jack did escape, but that wasn't, you know, it, it both were interesting to me.

Can you just dig in a little deeper? Like what do you mean? But for the game to work, it's, it's such a direct, it's like a Cooper talking about for this movie to work, it has to have, 'cause from my perspective, I just think about the story. What what's the technical aspect of for the game

Work? It's just me. You know, the mechanical experience is you have an avatar, you control and you, you, you know, the games don't really end and you have to be able to wander around the world and do stuff. So at the end of the game, you have to be able to wander around with your fairly limited set of features, which is you can, you know, run up to someone and punch them or run up to someone and shoot them or run up to someone and rob them or run up to someone and talk to them and, and that's kind and or run up, you know, jump on a horse or, or or do all this other stuff in order for the game store to be fun and people to get this full 360 degree experience with it. They had to, you know, a hundred if they wanted a hundred percent the game as opposed to just finishing the story, you have to have an avatar to do that stuff with. So that was, that was the sort of challenge of, of Jack's character slash wrapping up the story as Jack,

Oh, there's real power for the avatar to end the finiteness.

Yeah. Both the Red Deads, you obviously change Avatar, which we got, you know, and then did it again. I, I think there's something interesting about that moment when you change from one character to another because they are you and they're not you, you know, and then there's suddenly someone else.

I mean, I was really shaken by that experience, but it's a, it's a beautiful experience. It's like an unforgettable experience and that, what else can video games possibly reach for? You know, it's the, to create that experience. That's what great films do. That's what great, great great books do. It's

That, I mean it's that and the world building in games. I think the experience of being in this fake place and then taken on these narrative adventures, when that combines, you've got the amazing experience.

So who do you think is the best character you've ever created in RDR? So to me, I think definitively Arthur from Red Dead Redemption Two is the best character ever created in video games ever. I, I think there's not even clo I mean John will be the second, which is hilarious to say, but like tho those are, John will be a close second. But Arthur is definitively, and you, you've talked about, and in that interview you said that a lot of video games work on the same premise that you start as a weak person and end up as a strong superhero. But what if you start as a tough guy, someone who already is very strong, someone that's emotionally confident of his place in the world. Arthur's journey is not about becoming a superhero because he's almost one at the start, but it's about an intellectual rollercoaster when his worldview gets taken apart. So it's, it's, it's very different than the normal journey of a character.

Yeah. In a game.

In a game. Wanted to

Reverse it. Yeah. So there were a couple other themes that matched that. So there are guys from the Wild West, but they're being pushed ever further east. So it was almost like an anti-Western and Eastern, you're traveling east, you're traveling into civilization. And I, I don't think I would've been grappling with those ideas earlier in my career. 'cause it was, you know, idea of getting, getting a different kind of strength and a different kind of weakness was interesting.

What about the component of Mortality of a character facing his own Mortality over a prolonged period? Sort of just realize the, the, the prospect of like real sort of fear of death, realization of death.

Yeah. I thought that was really, it's

Part of the story.

Really fun thing to play with. John dies in Red Dead One and wanted to top that Red Dead two or do do that in a different way. And so the idea that it's John's death is fairly sudden. And so if he's got this long drawn out death, and then I'd always been obsessed by TB as diseases go, it's a great literary device, you know, 'cause it is this long drawn out slow death, but in which you are also getting weaker. And my grandfather actually had TB before they invented antibiotics and was sent to a sanatorium just after he was, just after he'd had his child, my father and survived. But only three of them out of like 35 survived. So I was always captivated and, and by TB as an illness, it felt like it was an interesting thing to play around with as an idea. This, this guy getting weaker who felt like he was immortal and essentially was immortal. He was the protagonist in a video game. He could not die and suddenly he's becoming mortal and, and you know, but that helps him see stuff. I thought that was a different way of doing a, a lead character in a game.

Yeah. Do you think it's the, the greatest character we ever created?

I think he's the best lead character. You know, the lead characters are different from the side characters and I think he's the, he's the most round rounded and works the best. I kind of, him and Nico are the two I like, you know, they were the two most ambitious. Yeah. So for me it's always, it's always sort of a toss up, you know? But then I loved all the stuff like the, the, the art team did such an amazing job. It was there with the journal and that kind of stuff, the way that all the features worked into Arthur's character. I thought that was really, he was really rounded. He worked in a, in lots of different ways. Really. Well I loved like his flawed relationship with his old girlfriend, things like that. All the side, you know, the bits that kind of turned up around him.

So you also like the side characters. You like the, the flavor, the Yeah, of course. Of the, the full cast. What are, what are some of the favorites you've created? I'm, I'm sure the one you're currently working on. Nigel Dave, that's a, you called him a psych character.

Well, he's not a protagonist. He's like a, he's a god not a character. Sure. So he's not him. I'm enjoying, I love Dutch, you know, it was partly because we wrote a few lines for him for the first game. And the actor did such a, a such an amazing job that when he spoke, it just came to me. All of their backstory, which I'd been playing around with by that point anyway, a little bit in my head. But I knew it was this bigger gang stuff and then I sort of saw exactly who he was. And so that was, that, that felt like he, he felt like a living character to me.

And we should say that Dutch is kind of like maybe a little bit of a God-like figure Yeah. In both of the Red Dead Redemption games and he's the leader of the gang. And there's a father son relationship with, with Dutch, with the, I mean with Arthur, with John, I mean there's, there's a family feeling to the gang that you explore all of those dynamics and then the feeling of betrayal and Arthur facing tuberculosis, you're going against the family, going against the father because he is transforming his sense of the world, of morality, of all those kinds of things. So all the kind of very Shakespearean dramas right there. And Dutch is a prominent godlike figure through all of that. Also flawed himself, also a man of good and evil in that framework that they're operating under.

And he, he's just drowning in his ego at the end. Yeah. You know, his ego gets the better of him. I think he's a but he, but there was something flawed but beautiful in his idealism when he was younger and that's mostly off camera, but, and then you're, you know, always been as an individual, I've always been very susceptible to charming people and he's charming. And so I always kind of, I can see how people get captivated by charming people. And, and the idea of here was a, a very charming person and the roads run out for him.

I personally am afraid of how much I love human beings and how susceptible I am to charm and charisma. Yeah. 'cause it can cause your judgment about human nature completely.

And that's what he, that's what's happened with him. And it, he ended up clouding his judgment about himself. He kind of fell for his own rubbish.

Yeah. But also it clouded Arthur's judgment. Oh completely.

Arthur was completely, you know, platonically in love with him. He was worshiping him, he'd given up his power to him. And then I think for Arthur, the journey is retaking that power in the moment of dying. You know, that's what the whole, that's what I thought that was really interesting.

Yeah. It's truly tragic for Arthur to be losing his identity, lifelong identity and the sense of belonging and losing his life at the same time in facing the Mortality. He is realizing that he's not, not all of it has been a lie,

But he gets to do some, well it depends on what the choices you make. Yeah. But he gets to do some good. Yes. And so he, you know, he gets his moment of redemption

Just a little bit. But realizing your whole life, you've been living not a good life. Yes. You've been not a good man.

Isn't that what we're all afraid of?

I guess it's never too late to change your voice. So the biggest, most important question, primary central to the reason we're talking today, the number one question from the internet, it is so ridiculous. But I must asked, have you seen Gavin? Who is Gavin? So for more context, there's a guy named Nigel in Red Dead Redemption two who's frantically searching for a mystery man named Gavin throughout the game. This has become one of the biggest mysteries amongst the interwebs, the RDR fan base. So the theories include theory one is it's a split personality disorder. Nigel himself is Gavin. So the evidence is the letter for this theory that has some evidence that may be due to trauma. The Split personality disorder was created, this Gavin was created inside Nigel's mind. Theory two is Gavin is dead and Nigel is simply in denial. Theory three is that it's just a troll and Rockstar intentionally created an unsolvable mystery to drive players crazy. I also heard theory four is Gavin is the strange man. So there's this fascinating character, the Strange Man, this supernatural character that has a presence in RDR one and a little bit in RDR two also. Yeah. So, which, which theory is closest to the truth?

Not three or four, somewhere in my mind. Somewhere between one and two. Yeah. I, I, I just love the way he shouted Gavin. It just amused me. So at some level it probably is trolling in that we didn't want it to be a totally clear mystery. You wanted it to have a little bit of adventure to it, but it was meant to be, without ever fully being explained that Gavin's not there anymore. Gavin's either gone home, Gavin's left him Gavin's and we were gonna keep exploring that idea he was gonna reappear in some way or other. Did you

Have any idea how much imagination, excitement and curiosity, that little interaction would inspire people?

Yes and no. I mean, no, you never know what people are gonna find amusing in these big games. And a lot of it comes down to acting as well. The guy was just funny when he said Gavin. Yeah. It was just funny. Yeah.",,,"Dan Houser is co-founder of Rockstar Games and is a legendary creative mind behind Grand Theft Auto (GTA) and Red Dead Redemption series of video games.

"supernatural character that has a presence in RDR one and a little bit in RDR two also. Yeah. So, which, which theory is closest to the truth?

Not three or four, somewhere in my mind. Somewhere between one and two. Yeah. I, I, I just love the way he shouted Gavin. It just amused me. So at some level it probably is trolling in that we didn't want it to be a totally clear mystery. You wanted it to have a little bit of adventure to it, but it was meant to be, without ever fully being explained that Gavin's not there anymore. Gavin's either gone home, Gavin's left him Gavin's and we were gonna keep exploring that idea he was gonna reappear in some way or other. Did you

Have any idea how much imagination, excitement and curiosity, that little interaction would inspire people?

Yes and no. I mean, no, you never know what people are gonna find amusing in these big games. And a lot of it comes down to acting as well. The guy was just funny when he said Gavin. Yeah. It was just funny. Yeah. You know, but there was a p in red, red direction one that everyone was obsessed by, and I really wasn't expecting that. So we try and put a few characters in. I mean, Gavin was supposed to be amusing. I thought he was amusing, but you never know what's what people are get obsessed by. There are other characters I think are funny and that people don't even notice them, you know, or, or they see them a completely different way.

Did you have a part in writing the letter?

Yeah. I can't remember if I wrote it or I, I either I wrote it or Mike wrote it, or we both wrote it. I really can't remember to be honest with you. But yeah, I certainly would've edited it and Mike might have written it or I might have written it. I really can't remember.

It's so fascinating because that little piece of writing, of course you have thousands of pages. Yeah. That little piece of writing gets like analyzed. Oh.

But we certainly talked about it in, in depth and if Mike was there, I'd ask it. I, he might remember, I can't me, we do so much of those things. And I loved the use of letters in Red Dead to tell all these weird backstories. And some became very clear and some were still a little kind of opaque, but the general vibe was there was no Gavin either, there was no Gavin or he belonged since left. So it's kind of a split personality, you know? And then we were gonna over subsequent games that provide more information.

So in some sense, you yourself don't quite know, you kind of have an idea. So he could like, like which way do you lean more theory one or two. Is he dead in the guy and and Nigel's in denial or is there a real communication go inside his head?

No, Gavin existed. So it wasn't that he was a split personality and, and the, the only thing we hadn't really decided was in a future game, were we gonna reveal that Gavin was dead or was Gavin gonna turn up having long since abandoned this maniac? You know, that was what we're still playing around with. I think the idea was that he was never gonna meet, he was never gonna meet Gavin in this game.

It's, it is just, it's just fascinating because you have to think about all of that. You have to write all of that. You have to have those discussions. You have to have those debates and

It has to feel fresh. That was like what we'd done before. Constantly looking as you do, you know, I think I did, you know, somewhere between 15 and 20 of these games got to do stuff that's new. It can't repeat itself too much.

I mean, we also live in the age of the internet. Just like you, you realize there's like millions of people worrying about where and who Gavin is.

Thank God.

It's like, it's fascinating that they're having it. You think about people reading like James Joyce or something and thinking about the cha like breaking apart You lease and thinking about like arguing about different interpretations of it. To me that in itself is also beautiful.

Yeah. We want the side mysteries to be solvable up to a point. But you still want, you want these discussions. Yeah, true. You know, and you want, but as, as long as it feels tonally appropriate for this whole big sort of shaggy dog story experience you're making, which Gavin was just about and he was so weird and he just was intrinsically of just something funny about an English person screaming gamut. I dunno why.

Yeah. Some of that humor, I mean there's, there's that there, there's certainly Red Dead Redemption, those humor, but there's a lot of Theft Auto and what, it's hard to put into words why that's funny, why it becomes mean, why it becomes viral. 'cause it's just funny. It's,

Yeah, I know why I think it's funny but I you what you can't, what I'm not good at doing at least is going, this thing will become really popular online and this other thing won't. Yeah. You can create this bunch of, you know, 50 different side things that people might get captivated by and you just do not know what they're gonna respond to.

How do you know when, when something's funny is you just feel it. Like,

I know what I think is funny. It's, you know,

You just giggle at yourself.

It just, because it's ridiculous as well. That was just, there's nothing funny about a dude shouting Gavin a lot. Yeah. He just said it a I just thought it might be funny and he just said it in such a funny way. Yeah. And then it just became funny. Like you, we often have those side characters and they're not that funny and I think they're gonna be hysterical and then you put them in the game and they're off, they're fine, but they're not amazing. That guy just brought that stuff to life. Yeah.

And those are backstory too. I mean Londoner and not, yeah, I

Think that was what, you know, just, there's something sometimes fun. You know, an English person saying the name Gavin is quite

Funny. Yeah. I dunno why So about the Strange Man AKA The Man of Black, is there some element with Michael and the therapist in Grand Theft Auto oh five, look, who is the strange man?

Well, the Strange Man was again, was, was was someone we came up with quickly. We made Red Dead one and we, well we're making Red Dead one and we'd made this, we felt quite compelling story and quite interesting open world. But, and we would, we'd already made a bunch of grand Theft Auto obviously, but unfortunately we'd taken out the machine guns 'cause it was a cowboy game apart from the big fixed position ones. And we'd taken out the cars and we'd taken out the city and large numbers of pedestrians. So we essentially had a game about a dude riding a horse around the desert. And it was quite, and it was quite boring. And so we were, we then started filling it with content and we filled it with these and having to improvise and we filled it with these things we call random events that would be they sort of mocap moments that you could interact with. And it was, they, they were, they were, the designers did an amazing job at those. They were really fun, but there was not enough of them. And then we felt we needed more story 'cause the story was perhaps a little short. So we kind of quite late in development started putting in almost like these RPG type content where you go and meet someone. And the way we thought of them was they were like short stories. So you go and meet someone, they'd set you a slow problem like go and collect me 15 bunches of flowers and when you came, came back it would resolve your story. And so one, go, go and get them for my bride. And you come back and the bride's dead. You know, there was always tried to make them like these short stories with a sting in the tail. And he came out as I was trying to come up with ideas for those as just this weird character. And then we built him a bit into the story where he would unlock as you worked your way through and be a commentary on what you were doing. So he was meant to be a kind of manifestation of your, you know, shadow, your karma, the devil somewhere, you know, just saw the world. And then we built out his backstory over time and decide, you know, and so in Red Dead too, you could interact with him again and or not really interact with him, but he was there and he was meant to be, you know, something, I suppose any creative is scared of an artist who'd kind of sold his soul to the devil. And that slowly revealed itself.

There is a connection between the, the main character and the, is it like a Jung and shadow type of situation? Well it's

Sort of because he knows what you're up to. The connection is and, and, and what's never really made clear is does he know this about everybody? Like is he following you or is he able, because of the pact he's made with, with, with, with, with evil forces able to do this for everybody. And I don't think we necessarily ever clarify that. He's certainly able to do it for you.

I mean there's, so narrative wise, there's techniques to reveal a kind of self-reflection analysis of the main character's thoughts. I mean that's why I brought up the therapist with Michael. That was a really powerful, interesting thing to do in the video game. Like, I, I don't think I've seen that. That's such a cool, I mean there's a sopranos element there with a therapist a little bit. Yeah. I really love an opportunity for a character to just self-reflect through that technique.

But it also changed depending on what you'd done. Yes. So it was, it was sort of slightly, it wasn't as interactive as it could be, but it was slightly interactive or slightly responsive to what you'd done. So it felt it was still valid video game content. 'cause it was living up to a point. And I just thought the character Dr. Freelander was just funny 'cause he was awful. So it was like LA you are in therapy, it's very LA but he's also very la he wants to write a book and betray you. Yeah. Which felt like a good, a good twist. And it was, he felt like a grand Theft Auto therapist. But just like the idea of making the player in a game and games are intrinsically kind of physical and you know, you, you walk, you, you punch things, you run around, you drive cars, you shoot people, whatever. There's these kind of physical fantasies. Trying to put them into a slightly more reflective or metaphysical state for a moment I think can be really fun.

I think to me one of the most surprising things about Red Dead Redemption, about video games that Red Red Dead Redemption showed is how much value for storytelling is insanely specific, intricate details in the story, but also visually it just added to the, the feeling that the world is real. So I have to ask, what what are some of your favorite insanely specific intricate details in, in RDRI give you some options. Internet's favorite is horse testicles shrinking in cold weather.

Those guys did an amazing job on those.

Yeah. Yeah. I mean I just, and there must have been a meeting and there must have been engineers and, and and graph designers.

I think just

Artists. Artists

Modelers, I think, I don't think it was that hard.

Okay. Enough for that pun. Thank you. Thank you for that. Arthur's hair and beer grow in real time. So gun maintenance matters. Firearms get dirty and perform worse over time. Animal carcasses decomposed realistically.

Yeah, they feel like they do.

That's still extremely rare in video games that at the temporal aspect. Yes. That permeates through time. You know, NPCs remembering you.

That's the best. I mean that's the thing. I love it playing around with a lot of stuff in the new games around that because I think it's super interesting.

It's really

Powerful to make the Yeah, really interesting. I think the, the, it just, it's a, it's a really fun way of giving you kind of narrative content that is also systemic and procedural.

Yeah. Is it technically really difficult to do for, for the game? For the game to feel like it remembers you? Yeah,

I think with modern tech it's not that hard but there's a lot of stuff you need to track to make it interesting.

Yeah. To have a memory. So that's really powerful. The mud physics. So Arthur's boots get muddy and leave actual tracks. I mean that's just incredible. Really, really incredible.

You know, we made the Dusty game, red Dead One is a super dusty game making, you know, and the problem with cowboys is that if you've tried to make a greatest hits of the cowboy game and then you've gotta make a sequel, you've gotta come up with different geographies. So that's why the game starts in the snow. So we wanted a game that had snow and mud because those were things you hadn't really seen in Red Dead one. And then the challenge is how do you make mud good in the game? And it guys did an amazing job.

I mean the, the snow storm that starts the game RDR two i, I don't remember the last time I've experienced anything like it. But you felt it. I don't know how the hell you do that. It's not just graphics, it's everything, everything together. I suppose some of the, the dialogue is really important to that. The

Acting, they feel, they feel cold.

Yeah, that's right.

And they feel desperate. That was that feeling of sort of, yes Exodus, like you're running away from something that gives the game sort of energy at the start.

And it was at night, oh man, it was just massive, massive

Big food. Food for them. The other con you know, first thing you start off as a lone wolf, suddenly you're in this big group. So it felt very different

In Arthur's body. Bullet wounds persist. So that that temporal consistency, that's really important. And then underweight, Arthur looks gone and overweight Arthur gets a gut and fuller face. Again, those like decisions that you make reveal themselves in the game across time and they're consistent. I don't know, I did have not seen many games do that. This, it must be difficult to do, but to, to give that level of care to the details in that way across time and for specific graphical representations of things is incredible.

Yeah.

Do you, do you have favorites? What, where you were first like this is, this is amazing.

I think all of it, I think the way the whole, to me, the thing that I would care about most was the way the whole thing sat together. You know, the fact that each of those, they all feel like they belong together with each other. You made this cohesive, very, you know, quote unquote realistic for a video game experience. And all the details feel like they mesh

Well for me. Everything about the horse. Yeah. For a lot of people. Yeah. Testicles, shrinking included. What's the process of deciding this? The internet seems to really care about, I mean they love the game so much, so they wanna know if anything was cut. And I'm sure stuff was cut. 'cause you, you have to choose what's the process of deciding what to cut, what the cut scenes like. Is, is there any scenes that you had to let go of that you really miss or wish you could have done in either GTA or RDR?

Well I think the games ended up the way they were supposed to be. Yeah. You know, I think there was always, there was a bit at the start of RDR where he'd had a baby who just died in Red Dead two and we ended up cutting it, which was the right decision. It was too tough in some ways, but I think it gave him real and he was not very sympathetic to his occasional girlfriend who'd had the baby. And so it made him very, very nasty at the start, which I thought would be interesting to play around with. 'cause then it would make his redemptive arc even more interesting. Like he was not a likable character at the start. And that was one. And we ended up making slightly more. Like he's still sort of tough and nasty, but he's slightly more likable. Early on that was the right decision. Commercially, it's better that way. But I don, you know, but I still, I, I like that little bit. It spoke to me personally there and, and just his, his in inability to access his emotions, I thought was really strong.",,,"Dan Houser is co-founder of Rockstar Games and is a legendary creative mind behind Grand Theft Auto (GTA) and Red Dead Redemption series of video games.

"supernatural character that has a presence in RDR one and a little bit in RDR two also. Yeah. So, which, which theory is closest to the truth?

Not three or four, somewhere in my mind. Somewhere between one and two. Yeah. I, I, I just love the way he shouted Gavin. It just amused me. So at some level it probably is trolling in that we didn't want it to be a totally clear mystery. You wanted it to have a little bit of adventure to it, but it was meant to be, without ever fully being explained that Gavin's not there anymore. Gavin's either gone home, Gavin's left him Gavin's and we were gonna keep exploring that idea he was gonna reappear in some way or other. Did you

Have any idea how much imagination, excitement and curiosity, that little interaction would inspire people?

Yes and no. I mean, no, you never know what people are gonna find amusing in these big games. And a lot of it comes down to acting as well. The guy was just funny when he said Gavin. Yeah. It was just funny. Yeah. You know, but there was a p in red, red direction one that everyone was obsessed by, and I really wasn't expecting that. So we try and put a few characters in. I mean, Gavin was supposed to be amusing. I thought he was amusing, but you never know what's what people are get obsessed by. There are other characters I think are funny and that people don't even notice them, you know, or, or they see them a completely different way.

Did you have a part in writing the letter?

Yeah. I can't remember if I wrote it or I, I either I wrote it or Mike wrote it, or we both wrote it. I really can't remember to be honest with you. But yeah, I certainly would've edited it and Mike might have written it or I might have written it. I really can't remember.

It's so fascinating because that little piece of writing, of course you have thousands of pages. Yeah. That little piece of writing gets like analyzed. Oh.

But we certainly talked about it in, in depth and if Mike was there, I'd ask it. I, he might remember, I can't me, we do so much of those things. And I loved the use of letters in Red Dead to tell all these weird backstories. And some became very clear and some were still a little kind of opaque, but the general vibe was there was no Gavin either, there was no Gavin or he belonged since left. So it's kind of a split personality, you know? And then we were gonna over subsequent games that provide more information.

So in some sense, you yourself don't quite know, you kind of have an idea. So he could like, like which way do you lean more theory one or two. Is he dead in the guy and and Nigel's in denial or is there a real communication go inside his head?

No, Gavin existed. So it wasn't that he was a split personality and, and the, the only thing we hadn't really decided was in a future game, were we gonna reveal that Gavin was dead or was Gavin gonna turn up having long since abandoned this maniac? You know, that was what we're still playing around with. I think the idea was that he was never gonna meet, he was never gonna meet Gavin in this game.

It's, it is just, it's just fascinating because you have to think about all of that. You have to write all of that. You have to have those discussions. You have to have those debates and

It has to feel fresh. That was like what we'd done before. Constantly looking as you do, you know, I think I did, you know, somewhere between 15 and 20 of these games got to do stuff that's new. It can't repeat itself too much.

I mean, we also live in the age of the internet. Just like you, you realize there's like millions of people worrying about where and who Gavin is.

Thank God.

It's like, it's fascinating that they're having it. You think about people reading like James Joyce or something and thinking about the cha like breaking apart You lease and thinking about like arguing about different interpretations of it. To me that in itself is also beautiful.

Yeah. We want the side mysteries to be solvable up to a point. But you still want, you want these discussions. Yeah, true. You know, and you want, but as, as long as it feels tonally appropriate for this whole big sort of shaggy dog story experience you're making, which Gavin was just about and he was so weird and he just was intrinsically of just something funny about an English person screaming gamut. I dunno why.

Yeah. Some of that humor, I mean there's, there's that there, there's certainly Red Dead Redemption, those humor, but there's a lot of Theft Auto and what, it's hard to put into words why that's funny, why it becomes mean, why it becomes viral. 'cause it's just funny. It's,

Yeah, I know why I think it's funny but I you what you can't, what I'm not good at doing at least is going, this thing will become really popular online and this other thing won't. Yeah. You can create this bunch of, you know, 50 different side things that people might get captivated by and you just do not know what they're gonna respond to.

How do you know when, when something's funny is you just feel it. Like,

I know what I think is funny. It's, you know,

You just giggle at yourself.

It just, because it's ridiculous as well. That was just, there's nothing funny about a dude shouting Gavin a lot. Yeah. He just said it a I just thought it might be funny and he just said it in such a funny way. Yeah. And then it just became funny. Like you, we often have those side characters and they're not that funny and I think they're gonna be hysterical and then you put them in the game and they're off, they're fine, but they're not amazing. That guy just brought that stuff to life. Yeah.

And those are backstory too. I mean Londoner and not, yeah, I

Think that was what, you know, just, there's something sometimes fun. You know, an English person saying the name Gavin is quite

Funny. Yeah. I dunno why So about the Strange Man AKA The Man of Black, is there some element with Michael and the therapist in Grand Theft Auto oh five, look, who is the strange man?

Well, the Strange Man was again, was, was was someone we came up with quickly. We made Red Dead one and we, well we're making Red Dead one and we'd made this, we felt quite compelling story and quite interesting open world. But, and we would, we'd already made a bunch of grand Theft Auto obviously, but unfortunately we'd taken out the machine guns 'cause it was a cowboy game apart from the big fixed position ones. And we'd taken out the cars and we'd taken out the city and large numbers of pedestrians. So we essentially had a game about a dude riding a horse around the desert. And it was quite, and it was quite boring. And so we were, we then started filling it with content and we filled it with these and having to improvise and we filled it with these things we call random events that would be they sort of mocap moments that you could interact with. And it was, they, they were, they were, the designers did an amazing job at those. They were really fun, but there was not enough of them. And then we felt we needed more story 'cause the story was perhaps a little short. So we kind of quite late in development started putting in almost like these RPG type content where you go and meet someone. And the way we thought of them was they were like short stories. So you go and meet someone, they'd set you a slow problem like go and collect me 15 bunches of flowers and when you came, came back it would resolve your story. And so one, go, go and get them for my bride. And you come back and the bride's dead. You know, there was always tried to make them like these short stories with a sting in the tail. And he came out as I was trying to come up with ideas for those as just this weird character. And then we built him a bit into the story where he would unlock as you worked your way through and be a commentary on what you were doing. So he was meant to be a kind of manifestation of your, you know, shadow, your karma, the devil somewhere, you know, just saw the world. And then we built out his backstory over time and decide, you know, and so in Red Dead too, you could interact with him again and or not really interact with him, but he was there and he was meant to be, you know, something, I suppose any creative is scared of an artist who'd kind of sold his soul to the devil. And that slowly revealed itself.

There is a connection between the, the main character and the, is it like a Jung and shadow type of situation? Well it's

Sort of because he knows what you're up to. The connection is and, and, and what's never really made clear is does he know this about everybody? Like is he following you or is he able, because of the pact he's made with, with, with, with, with evil forces able to do this for everybody. And I don't think we necessarily ever clarify that. He's certainly able to do it for you.

I mean there's, so narrative wise, there's techniques to reveal a kind of self-reflection analysis of the main character's thoughts. I mean that's why I brought up the therapist with Michael. That was a really powerful, interesting thing to do in the video game. Like, I, I don't think I've seen that. That's such a cool, I mean there's a sopranos element there with a therapist a little bit. Yeah. I really love an opportunity for a character to just self-reflect through that technique.

But it also changed depending on what you'd done. Yes. So it was, it was sort of slightly, it wasn't as interactive as it could be, but it was slightly interactive or slightly responsive to what you'd done. So it felt it was still valid video game content. 'cause it was living up to a point. And I just thought the character Dr. Freelander was just funny 'cause he was awful. So it was like LA you are in therapy, it's very LA but he's also very la he wants to write a book and betray you. Yeah. Which felt like a good, a good twist. And it was, he felt like a grand Theft Auto therapist. But just like the idea of making the player in a game and games are intrinsically kind of physical and you know, you, you walk, you, you punch things, you run around, you drive cars, you shoot people, whatever. There's these kind of physical fantasies. Trying to put them into a slightly more reflective or metaphysical state for a moment I think can be really fun.

I think to me one of the most surprising things about Red Dead Redemption, about video games that Red Red Dead Redemption showed is how much value for storytelling is insanely specific, intricate details in the story, but also visually it just added to the, the feeling that the world is real. So I have to ask, what what are some of your favorite insanely specific intricate details in, in RDRI give you some options. Internet's favorite is horse testicles shrinking in cold weather.

Those guys did an amazing job on those.

Yeah. Yeah. I mean I just, and there must have been a meeting and there must have been engineers and, and and graph designers.

I think just

Artists. Artists

Modelers, I think, I don't think it was that hard.

Okay. Enough for that pun. Thank you. Thank you for that. Arthur's hair and beer grow in real time. So gun maintenance matters. Firearms get dirty and perform worse over time. Animal carcasses decomposed realistically.

Yeah, they feel like they do.

That's still extremely rare in video games that at the temporal aspect. Yes. That permeates through time. You know, NPCs remembering you.

That's the best. I mean that's the thing. I love it playing around with a lot of stuff in the new games around that because I think it's super interesting.

It's really

Powerful to make the Yeah, really interesting. I think the, the, it just, it's a, it's a really fun way of giving you kind of narrative content that is also systemic and procedural.

Yeah. Is it technically really difficult to do for, for the game? For the game to feel like it remembers you? Yeah,

I think with modern tech it's not that hard but there's a lot of stuff you need to track to make it interesting.

Yeah. To have a memory. So that's really powerful. The mud physics. So Arthur's boots get muddy and leave actual tracks. I mean that's just incredible. Really, really incredible.

You know, we made the Dusty game, red Dead One is a super dusty game making, you know, and the problem with cowboys is that if you've tried to make a greatest hits of the cowboy game and then you've gotta make a sequel, you've gotta come up with different geographies. So that's why the game starts in the snow. So we wanted a game that had snow and mud because those were things you hadn't really seen in Red Dead one. And then the challenge is how do you make mud good in the game? And it guys did an amazing job.

I mean the, the snow storm that starts the game RDR two i, I don't remember the last time I've experienced anything like it. But you felt it. I don't know how the hell you do that. It's not just graphics, it's everything, everything together. I suppose some of the, the dialogue is really important to that. The

Acting, they feel, they feel cold.

Yeah, that's right.

And they feel desperate. That was that feeling of sort of, yes Exodus, like you're running away from something that gives the game sort of energy at the start.

And it was at night, oh man, it was just massive, massive

Big food. Food for them. The other con you know, first thing you start off as a lone wolf, suddenly you're in this big group. So it felt very different

In Arthur's body. Bullet wounds persist. So that that temporal consistency, that's really important. And then underweight, Arthur looks gone and overweight Arthur gets a gut and fuller face. Again, those like decisions that you make reveal themselves in the game across time and they're consistent. I don't know, I did have not seen many games do that. This, it must be difficult to do, but to, to give that level of care to the details in that way across time and for specific graphical representations of things is incredible.

Yeah.

Do you, do you have favorites? What, where you were first like this is, this is amazing.

I think all of it, I think the way the whole, to me, the thing that I would care about most was the way the whole thing sat together. You know, the fact that each of those, they all feel like they belong together with each other. You made this cohesive, very, you know, quote unquote realistic for a video game experience. And all the details feel like they mesh

Well for me. Everything about the horse. Yeah. For a lot of people. Yeah. Testicles, shrinking included. What's the process of deciding this? The internet seems to really care about, I mean they love the game so much, so they wanna know if anything was cut. And I'm sure stuff was cut. 'cause you, you have to choose what's the process of deciding what to cut, what the cut scenes like. Is, is there any scenes that you had to let go of that you really miss or wish you could have done in either GTA or RDR?

Well I think the games ended up the way they were supposed to be. Yeah. You know, I think there was always, there was a bit at the start of RDR where he'd had a baby who just died in Red Dead two and we ended up cutting it, which was the right decision. It was too tough in some ways, but I think it gave him real and he was not very sympathetic to his occasional girlfriend who'd had the baby. And so it made him very, very nasty at the start, which I thought would be interesting to play around with. 'cause then it would make his redemptive arc even more interesting. Like he was not a likable character at the start. And that was one. And we ended up making slightly more. Like he's still sort of tough and nasty, but he's slightly more likable. Early on that was the right decision. Commercially, it's better that way. But I don, you know, but I still, I, I like that little bit. It spoke to me personally there and, and just his, his in inability to access his emotions, I thought was really strong.",,,"Dan Houser is co-founder of Rockstar Games and is a legendary creative mind behind Grand Theft Auto (GTA) and Red Dead Redemption series of video games.

"For whatever reason. Just that was just good fortune.

Laslow mentioned that was another legend who you're still working with. He mentioned that you would lock yourself in a writing dialogue for radio. I think you would lock yourself in a room and get anchovies and onion pizza and crushed Diet Cokes. Is this accurate information, very

Accurate

For which periods of your life was this a a fuel for your creative process? Is it anchovies and onion pizza?

I would also get pepperoni on my half just to be technically accurate. Okay. He wouldn't, 'cause he claimed to be a vegetarian in those days. Yeah. But then he'd admit to me, kept chicken wings hidden in the freezer. Yeah. So it was a sort of fake vegetarian that was, or I think we still do it now. Sometimes it's sort of memorialized. But that began in 2001. Yeah. And we, the, the office at, at Rockstar was so small and we were so broke that there was no, and I, I did have a private office at the time, but it genuinely was a cupboard. It didn't have a window. I was literally sitting in a cupboard, so there was no room. And I could had a desk and a chair just for myself. So we, but I lived quite near the office. So we would write one or two afternoons a week. He'd come in, he was a freelancer working with us. He'd come in from Long Island and then we would jump on the subway, Go to my apartment in Chelsea and sit in this grimy little apartment I was living in and buy pizza from around the corner. And that became, and you know, we both liked Diet Coke and pizza, very video game developer. And that became good luck. And we'd have these good writing sessions where we realized we got on well with each other and that we had a similar sense of humor and we could write the stuff and then he would do all of the real work producing it. So it was perfect for me because I gotta outsource most of the real work. And he's a brilliant radio producer. So he was a great partner in that way. And then that was how that relationship began. And then I'd get him, I would say, well, we've got to record these 80 voices, come and help me. 'cause I can't direct 80 people at once. So he would help with that process. And he was a really good producer, like audio, like getting bodies in producer as well as a technical producer. So he was just a, that was the beginning of that relationship. And it was always my job was to ensure the media content felt like it reflected the tone of the world and we would write it together. Then his job was just to make sure it sounded funny. Like he would just produce it in a really funny way.

J just to give a little bit more of a shout out to Laslo, I, what, what's it been like working with him for over 20 years? He's working with you still? He's a kind of, yeah, this flamboyant, colorful personality. Much loved for being a voice also on radio in the, in the grant Theft Auto games.

Yeah. And the rule was when he was the character, I would write the first pass of him. So I would, and I would get nastier and nastier over

Time. Yeah, that's awesome.

So to the point where he is having his head shaved and you know, being punished by everybody. But even in game after game, he got wor he, yeah, he began as his quite and GTA three, he's a quite likable character. And then, you know, over the next 12, 13 years, it just got worse and worse. Yeah. So I, I think he's glad not to be doing that anymore because, but he did it with great Grace. He's just a great partner because he likes, he like, you know, yeah. Like me, we just like making stuff. He likes to make stuff, he likes to work in new spaces. He's been a great help on bringing the comic book to life, doing a lot of the work on that. He's working on that right now. And just, he's, he's, he's really fun to work with and he is, you know, always will put creativity first and he iss ridiculous. You know, such a,

In the best possible way. Yeah. Outside of the games you've participated in, created, what do you think are some candidates for the Greatest game of all time?

Tetris.

Tetris.

Tetris Game Boy, no question.

Tetris and a Game Boy. Yeah.

It was the perfect device for playing that game. I never liked as much anything else. When my wife was trying to get a retro one for my kids, trying to get them for Christmas right now, it was the most addicted I ever was to anything in my life of far too many addictions that I was obsessed by it, dreaming about it. And when you link two together with the cable, and if I got four, it would push yours, four up. It was like the perfect game design. So from a pure puzzle perspective, nothing comes close.

Yeah. It's extremely simple. Yeah. Pure gameplay. No narrative,

No, no nothing. No, no personality at all. It's a completely different thing. Perfection. But per but perfect in its way open. More games can't be that perfect. Yeah. But you always dream of making something like that.

The Super Mario,

I think the N 64 ones, all of those early 3D games were very amazing when you first saw them. Yeah. On the N 64 PS one. When you went it suddenly it was like these games, they were alive and well, they're believable in a different way. I think that was very interesting.

It looks sound like anything else

Nintendo has that look. Yeah. Doesn't it always?

Yeah. And I, I think that's the, they're known for this Nintendo Polisher. Every Pixel has a purpose. Yes. And what do I mean, I, I suppose Tetris has that same real focus on delivering a pure gaming experience with as little as possible. It's really beautiful. And of course Zelda really pioneered a lot of sort of the feeling of, of a world, but it's not quite open world.

No, but it's amazing. It's almost like the new ones. They almost to me feel like Hitchcock, they just speaking the language of video games, you know, like, you know, everything's gonna work this way in that way. It's, it, it's quite systemic, but it's so how it all glues together is so amazing. It feels like when you watch a Hitchcock film, it's not reality. He's speaking the language of cinema in a very, very strong, without a very strong accent almost. It's very, very cinematic. It's not realism at all. And that's what those Zelda games kind of feel to me. Like. There are these amazing things that could only be video games. They couldn't be anything else.

For me, another really powerful open world is the, the elder squirrels world role playing, it's fantasy dragons, all that kind of stuff.

Todd is great at what he does. Yeah. There's, they're slightly, they're more, I mean, from a technical perspective, we are always involved. I in the same with the new, with the new games, we're constantly trying to find the balance between, you know, RPG of role playing game and an action game and an, you know, and try go, well, an action adventure game with RPG elements and what does that mean? And I think they've all kind of moved into roughly the same space. But for me it always just comes down to our, is it easy to play? Oh, our mechanics super slick. And then can we keep our dialogue feeling very alive? Like I'm not always a great for just for what we do. I like when other people do it for what we do. We always want very punchy dialogue, so don't give big trees, but still have it interactive. So we're gonna, we're gonna lose a touch of interactivity, but we'll still have the dialogue feeling like it's alive, but we'll get better written dialogue and it feel more, a slightly more cinematic experience.

Yeah. I I think the Elder scroll series have almost always leaned a little more towards the open world. Yes.

They're real RPGs. Yeah. You know, we've not re the games that, you know, I, I've worked on, they've not really been RPGs. They've had RP G Elements onto a story driven action game. It's a kind of just a slightly different emphasis, but I still think what they do is amazing. They, he's brilliant at doing.

And I, I, I think Grand Theft Auto, Red Dead Redemption and Skyrim are, are games where you have millions of people that just walk around or drive around

And feel the world.

Feel the world. Yeah. Just feel the world

And the Witcher, same thing.

And Balter Gate one, two, and three really interesting. They really tried to make every choice that you make genuinely branch the game to where it's not the illusion of choice, it's really, it really choice really does something. And that's really hard to pull off technically.

Yes. And hard to pull off. You've always sort of debating the, the sweet spot between that and a strong story. Yeah. You know, and strong mechanics. It's hard to get them all. And you, you know, as a, as a, as a, a game making team, the whole, you know, the teams kind of have to figure out where they want to fall on that line.

A difficult topic. You dedicated the book to your mom and dad and in particular you wrote to my father who died while I was finishing the book. What have you learned about life from your dad?

To show up, to be present, to Go to work every day. To love creative things. You know, he was a lawyer, but he is also a jazz musician. And he did both to the best of his abilities, you know, and he value family as more important than either of those things. You know, he was a present guy, I think, and, and you know, he loved books, always loved books, always loved but loved films. Loved mo music. Didn't, wasn't into video games, but liked that we were doing weird things.

Was he proud of you?

Yeah, I think so. I hope so. And he was, he was for, for a lawyer. He really venerated at some level, giving the man the, the, the quote unquote the man the finger. Like, you know, whenever life goes crazy. Yeah. He just was always on the side of the underdog and the ridiculous and, and I think that, you know, he always wanted to answer people back. Always give the silly comment. And I certainly, you know, taken that from him to my detriment probably. But it makes life more fun. Like he always would just say the obnoxious thing and just didn't give a fuck. And that was, you know, that was, I think that was probably quite inspiring.

So you have a bit of that in you

Unfortunately. So, yes. Not good at shutting up, not good at towing the line.

I think I speak for most of human civilization, that realization. Fortunately, you have that as part of, as part of who you are because it, it comes through your stories.

I think it made school difficult, you know, they sent me this very formal school. Yeah. That was like, it might as well have been set in the 1870s in the 1990s. And, but then they want, you know, I always get in trouble just for not, not for doing anything that wrong, just answering teachers back all of the time. Couldn't be quiet.

How often do you think about Mortality? Are you personally yourself afraid of death?

Well, my father passed away in May, so a lot more since then, obviously. I mean, I think about it a lot. Am I afraid of it? I don't know. Some days intensely and some days not at all. I would love to stay alive long enough to see my kids properly grow up and settled of course for them. I don't, aside from that, some days I feel, you know, spiritually connected to the universe and, and, and not afraid of death at all. And other days I feel like a sort of random piece of, of, of good luck who's gonna get struck down by an angry fate and turn to nothingness. And that terrifies me. I just,

What do you think about the nothingness? I mean that, that in itself is terrifying. Yeah,

That is terrifying. That, I mean, I'm, I I I tend to, I I tend to, you know, I've spent long periods of my life tormented by that stuff. The, the last few years. I tend to believe that is a purpose and a point to life. And that we have some kind of spiritual or soul based existence. Not, I'm not quite sure if it matters if there is a God or not. We should probably live our lives the same way either way. But I tend to think that that, you know, there is a metaphysical purpose to life and part of the, that purpose is to, you know, search for the purpose search. But at other points you can get, you know, if you read too much science, you get wrapped up in the nothingness of it all.

Also, there's a component to, to your brain when talking about weathering heights by Emily Bronte, you said that you have been by fortune struck with a bit of a capacity for the grandiosity of feeling. So you feel the world deeply, sometimes romantic, sometimes overly romantic. You've said, I like this line, feelings may destroy you, but they're the best thing we have. So that ability to feel the world, is that a gift or a curse for you? What do you think?

That's a really interesting question because it's obviously both, you know, times it's both or times it's one or the other. When things are going well, when you feel alive, when you feel like you are connected to things, when you are seeing beauty in people and, and joy and experiences, of course it's, it's, it's wonderful when you are feeling like, you know, bereft and set adrift by the world and that you can't connect it to it in some way, and you are lost and abandoned by God or consciousness or fate or whatever it is. It's awful. You know, when I feel like a dreadful hack, which is most of the time, you know, it's terrible. You'd rather not be doing this rubbish. And then sometimes you're working creatively and it feels good and you feel like you're doing the right thing and it feels fantastic. But that's not very often.

Do you think it's possible to have one without the other? No.

Yeah. No, of course not. When I think about growing up, to the extent that I am capable of growing up, it is about accepting the bad with the good from any situation or any aspect of myself, you know, going, okay, it's not perfect or I'm not perfect.

You, you said you often feel like a hack. Is that that self-critical part of your brain? Is that a feature or a bug?

That's an, I think it's the, that that new thing that we're gonna lean into the bug feature. Yeah, it's both, isn't it? I mean it's, it's, it cannot lead that self-critical brain I think lots of people suffer from. And, and I think the internet is designed to induce, if you didn't have it before, you will have it after being online. It's clearly can become a bug, but it also can give you drive and a lack of complacency. So it can, can also become a feature.

I had a pretty intense argument with Paul Conte, who's a legendary psychiatrist student of the mind about this. He worked with many famous creative people and he, he thinks that that negative voice is not at all needed for creative genius. And I thought, I know awfully a lot of creative people that have that voice.

I'd rather not have it. But I certainly have lived with it this far that there's a danger that negativity for me that negativity and consciousness become the same thing. You know? And sometimes I have to fight to not just be perpetually negative and that can be part of the human struggle for lots of people and certainly has been for me. I think if you are trying to do, you know, good stuff and you are reflective inevitably and, and, you know, you live in this world of constant, constant criticisms by the internet. Of course, you know, everyone who ever puts something on the internet, be it a picture of themselves or any kind of work they've made or whatever it is, is gonna get 50 good comments and one bad comment, remember the bad comment. So that, and that, that becomes fuel for the negative voice. I dunno anyone that's strong enough not to, you know, we all, you know, some level you should just measure stuff that stuff in, in weight, not in, not in quality, but of course we just focus on the quality.

And I do think in general, as you get older, that's the real challenge for people. You, you see the different trajectories people choose to take, but it's easy to slip into cynicism and negativity into this. The s's notes from underground nihilistic kind of worldview.",,,"Dan Houser is co-founder of Rockstar Games and is a legendary creative mind behind Grand Theft Auto (GTA) and Red Dead Redemption series of video games.

"For whatever reason. Just that was just good fortune.

Laslow mentioned that was another legend who you're still working with. He mentioned that you would lock yourself in a writing dialogue for radio. I think you would lock yourself in a room and get anchovies and onion pizza and crushed Diet Cokes. Is this accurate information, very

Accurate

For which periods of your life was this a a fuel for your creative process? Is it anchovies and onion pizza?

I would also get pepperoni on my half just to be technically accurate. Okay. He wouldn't, 'cause he claimed to be a vegetarian in those days. Yeah. But then he'd admit to me, kept chicken wings hidden in the freezer. Yeah. So it was a sort of fake vegetarian that was, or I think we still do it now. Sometimes it's sort of memorialized. But that began in 2001. Yeah. And we, the, the office at, at Rockstar was so small and we were so broke that there was no, and I, I did have a private office at the time, but it genuinely was a cupboard. It didn't have a window. I was literally sitting in a cupboard, so there was no room. And I could had a desk and a chair just for myself. So we, but I lived quite near the office. So we would write one or two afternoons a week. He'd come in, he was a freelancer working with us. He'd come in from Long Island and then we would jump on the subway, Go to my apartment in Chelsea and sit in this grimy little apartment I was living in and buy pizza from around the corner. And that became, and you know, we both liked Diet Coke and pizza, very video game developer. And that became good luck. And we'd have these good writing sessions where we realized we got on well with each other and that we had a similar sense of humor and we could write the stuff and then he would do all of the real work producing it. So it was perfect for me because I gotta outsource most of the real work. And he's a brilliant radio producer. So he was a great partner in that way. And then that was how that relationship began. And then I'd get him, I would say, well, we've got to record these 80 voices, come and help me. 'cause I can't direct 80 people at once. So he would help with that process. And he was a really good producer, like audio, like getting bodies in producer as well as a technical producer. So he was just a, that was the beginning of that relationship. And it was always my job was to ensure the media content felt like it reflected the tone of the world and we would write it together. Then his job was just to make sure it sounded funny. Like he would just produce it in a really funny way.

J just to give a little bit more of a shout out to Laslo, I, what, what's it been like working with him for over 20 years? He's working with you still? He's a kind of, yeah, this flamboyant, colorful personality. Much loved for being a voice also on radio in the, in the grant Theft Auto games.

Yeah. And the rule was when he was the character, I would write the first pass of him. So I would, and I would get nastier and nastier over

Time. Yeah, that's awesome.

So to the point where he is having his head shaved and you know, being punished by everybody. But even in game after game, he got wor he, yeah, he began as his quite and GTA three, he's a quite likable character. And then, you know, over the next 12, 13 years, it just got worse and worse. Yeah. So I, I think he's glad not to be doing that anymore because, but he did it with great Grace. He's just a great partner because he likes, he like, you know, yeah. Like me, we just like making stuff. He likes to make stuff, he likes to work in new spaces. He's been a great help on bringing the comic book to life, doing a lot of the work on that. He's working on that right now. And just, he's, he's, he's really fun to work with and he is, you know, always will put creativity first and he iss ridiculous. You know, such a,

In the best possible way. Yeah. Outside of the games you've participated in, created, what do you think are some candidates for the Greatest game of all time?

Tetris.

Tetris.

Tetris Game Boy, no question.

Tetris and a Game Boy. Yeah.

It was the perfect device for playing that game. I never liked as much anything else. When my wife was trying to get a retro one for my kids, trying to get them for Christmas right now, it was the most addicted I ever was to anything in my life of far too many addictions that I was obsessed by it, dreaming about it. And when you link two together with the cable, and if I got four, it would push yours, four up. It was like the perfect game design. So from a pure puzzle perspective, nothing comes close.

Yeah. It's extremely simple. Yeah. Pure gameplay. No narrative,

No, no nothing. No, no personality at all. It's a completely different thing. Perfection. But per but perfect in its way open. More games can't be that perfect. Yeah. But you always dream of making something like that.

The Super Mario,

I think the N 64 ones, all of those early 3D games were very amazing when you first saw them. Yeah. On the N 64 PS one. When you went it suddenly it was like these games, they were alive and well, they're believable in a different way. I think that was very interesting.

It looks sound like anything else

Nintendo has that look. Yeah. Doesn't it always?

Yeah. And I, I think that's the, they're known for this Nintendo Polisher. Every Pixel has a purpose. Yes. And what do I mean, I, I suppose Tetris has that same real focus on delivering a pure gaming experience with as little as possible. It's really beautiful. And of course Zelda really pioneered a lot of sort of the feeling of, of a world, but it's not quite open world.

No, but it's amazing. It's almost like the new ones. They almost to me feel like Hitchcock, they just speaking the language of video games, you know, like, you know, everything's gonna work this way in that way. It's, it, it's quite systemic, but it's so how it all glues together is so amazing. It feels like when you watch a Hitchcock film, it's not reality. He's speaking the language of cinema in a very, very strong, without a very strong accent almost. It's very, very cinematic. It's not realism at all. And that's what those Zelda games kind of feel to me. Like. There are these amazing things that could only be video games. They couldn't be anything else.

For me, another really powerful open world is the, the elder squirrels world role playing, it's fantasy dragons, all that kind of stuff.

Todd is great at what he does. Yeah. There's, they're slightly, they're more, I mean, from a technical perspective, we are always involved. I in the same with the new, with the new games, we're constantly trying to find the balance between, you know, RPG of role playing game and an action game and an, you know, and try go, well, an action adventure game with RPG elements and what does that mean? And I think they've all kind of moved into roughly the same space. But for me it always just comes down to our, is it easy to play? Oh, our mechanics super slick. And then can we keep our dialogue feeling very alive? Like I'm not always a great for just for what we do. I like when other people do it for what we do. We always want very punchy dialogue, so don't give big trees, but still have it interactive. So we're gonna, we're gonna lose a touch of interactivity, but we'll still have the dialogue feeling like it's alive, but we'll get better written dialogue and it feel more, a slightly more cinematic experience.

Yeah. I I think the Elder scroll series have almost always leaned a little more towards the open world. Yes.

They're real RPGs. Yeah. You know, we've not re the games that, you know, I, I've worked on, they've not really been RPGs. They've had RP G Elements onto a story driven action game. It's a kind of just a slightly different emphasis, but I still think what they do is amazing. They, he's brilliant at doing.

And I, I, I think Grand Theft Auto, Red Dead Redemption and Skyrim are, are games where you have millions of people that just walk around or drive around

And feel the world.

Feel the world. Yeah. Just feel the world

And the Witcher, same thing.

And Balter Gate one, two, and three really interesting. They really tried to make every choice that you make genuinely branch the game to where it's not the illusion of choice, it's really, it really choice really does something. And that's really hard to pull off technically.

Yes. And hard to pull off. You've always sort of debating the, the sweet spot between that and a strong story. Yeah. You know, and strong mechanics. It's hard to get them all. And you, you know, as a, as a, as a, a game making team, the whole, you know, the teams kind of have to figure out where they want to fall on that line.

"For whatever reason. Just that was just good fortune.

Laslow mentioned that was another legend who you're still working with. He mentioned that you would lock yourself in a writing dialogue for radio. I think you would lock yourself in a room and get anchovies and onion pizza and crushed Diet Cokes. Is this accurate information, very

Accurate

For which periods of your life was this a a fuel for your creative process? Is it anchovies and onion pizza?

I would also get pepperoni on my half just to be technically accurate. Okay. He wouldn't, 'cause he claimed to be a vegetarian in those days. Yeah. But then he'd admit to me, kept chicken wings hidden in the freezer. Yeah. So it was a sort of fake vegetarian that was, or I think we still do it now. Sometimes it's sort of memorialized. But that began in 2001. Yeah. And we, the, the office at, at Rockstar was so small and we were so broke that there was no, and I, I did have a private office at the time, but it genuinely was a cupboard. It didn't have a window. I was literally sitting in a cupboard, so there was no room. And I could had a desk and a chair just for myself. So we, but I lived quite near the office. So we would write one or two afternoons a week. He'd come in, he was a freelancer working with us. He'd come in from Long Island and then we would jump on the subway, Go to my apartment in Chelsea and sit in this grimy little apartment I was living in and buy pizza from around the corner. And that became, and you know, we both liked Diet Coke and pizza, very video game developer. And that became good luck. And we'd have these good writing sessions where we realized we got on well with each other and that we had a similar sense of humor and we could write the stuff and then he would do all of the real work producing it. So it was perfect for me because I gotta outsource most of the real work. And he's a brilliant radio producer. So he was a great partner in that way. And then that was how that relationship began. And then I'd get him, I would say, well, we've got to record these 80 voices, come and help me. 'cause I can't direct 80 people at once. So he would help with that process. And he was a really good producer, like audio, like getting bodies in producer as well as a technical producer. So he was just a, that was the beginning of that relationship. And it was always my job was to ensure the media content felt like it reflected the tone of the world and we would write it together. Then his job was just to make sure it sounded funny. Like he would just produce it in a really funny way.

J just to give a little bit more of a shout out to Laslo, I, what, what's it been like working with him for over 20 years? He's working with you still? He's a kind of, yeah, this flamboyant, colorful personality. Much loved for being a voice also on radio in the, in the grant Theft Auto games.

Yeah. And the rule was when he was the character, I would write the first pass of him. So I would, and I would get nastier and nastier over

Time. Yeah, that's awesome.

So to the point where he is having his head shaved and you know, being punished by everybody. But even in game after game, he got wor he, yeah, he began as his quite and GTA three, he's a quite likable character. And then, you know, over the next 12, 13 years, it just got worse and worse. Yeah. So I, I think he's glad not to be doing that anymore because, but he did it with great Grace. He's just a great partner because he likes, he like, you know, yeah. Like me, we just like making stuff. He likes to make stuff, he likes to work in new spaces. He's been a great help on bringing the comic book to life, doing a lot of the work on that. He's working on that right now. And just, he's, he's, he's really fun to work with and he is, you know, always will put creativity first and he iss ridiculous. You know, such a,

In the best possible way. Yeah. Outside of the games you've participated in, created, what do you think are some candidates for the Greatest game of all time?

Tetris.

Tetris.

Tetris Game Boy, no question.

Tetris and a Game Boy. Yeah.

It was the perfect device for playing that game. I never liked as much anything else. When my wife was trying to get a retro one for my kids, trying to get them for Christmas right now, it was the most addicted I ever was to anything in my life of far too many addictions that I was obsessed by it, dreaming about it. And when you link two together with the cable, and if I got four, it would push yours, four up. It was like the perfect game design. So from a pure puzzle perspective, nothing comes close.

Yeah. It's extremely simple. Yeah. Pure gameplay. No narrative,

No, no nothing. No, no personality at all. It's a completely different thing. Perfection. But per but perfect in its way open. More games can't be that perfect. Yeah. But you always dream of making something like that.

The Super Mario,

I think the N 64 ones, all of those early 3D games were very amazing when you first saw them. Yeah. On the N 64 PS one. When you went it suddenly it was like these games, they were alive and well, they're believable in a different way. I think that was very interesting.

It looks sound like anything else

Nintendo has that look. Yeah. Doesn't it always?

Yeah. And I, I think that's the, they're known for this Nintendo Polisher. Every Pixel has a purpose. Yes. And what do I mean, I, I suppose Tetris has that same real focus on delivering a pure gaming experience with as little as possible. It's really beautiful. And of course Zelda really pioneered a lot of sort of the feeling of, of a world, but it's not quite open world.

No, but it's amazing. It's almost like the new ones. They almost to me feel like Hitchcock, they just speaking the language of video games, you know, like, you know, everything's gonna work this way in that way. It's, it, it's quite systemic, but it's so how it all glues together is so amazing. It feels like when you watch a Hitchcock film, it's not reality. He's speaking the language of cinema in a very, very strong, without a very strong accent almost. It's very, very cinematic. It's not realism at all. And that's what those Zelda games kind of feel to me. Like. There are these amazing things that could only be video games. They couldn't be anything else.

For me, another really powerful open world is the, the elder squirrels world role playing, it's fantasy dragons, all that kind of stuff.

Todd is great at what he does. Yeah. There's, they're slightly, they're more, I mean, from a technical perspective, we are always involved. I in the same with the new, with the new games, we're constantly trying to find the balance between, you know, RPG of role playing game and an action game and an, you know, and try go, well, an action adventure game with RPG elements and what does that mean? And I think they've all kind of moved into roughly the same space. But for me it always just comes down to our, is it easy to play? Oh, our mechanics super slick. And then can we keep our dialogue feeling very alive? Like I'm not always a great for just for what we do. I like when other people do it for what we do. We always want very punchy dialogue, so don't give big trees, but still have it interactive. So we're gonna, we're gonna lose a touch of interactivity, but we'll still have the dialogue feeling like it's alive, but we'll get better written dialogue and it feel more, a slightly more cinematic experience.

Yeah. I I think the Elder scroll series have almost always leaned a little more towards the open world. Yes.

They're real RPGs. Yeah. You know, we've not re the games that, you know, I, I've worked on, they've not really been RPGs. They've had RP G Elements onto a story driven action game. It's a kind of just a slightly different emphasis, but I still think what they do is amazing. They, he's brilliant at doing.

And I, I, I think Grand Theft Auto, Red Dead Redemption and Skyrim are, are games where you have millions of people that just walk around or drive around

And feel the world.

Feel the world. Yeah. Just feel the world

And the Witcher, same thing.

And Balter Gate one, two, and three really interesting. They really tried to make every choice that you make genuinely branch the game to where it's not the illusion of choice, it's really, it really choice really does something. And that's really hard to pull off technically.

Yes. And hard to pull off. You've always sort of debating the, the sweet spot between that and a strong story. Yeah. You know, and strong mechanics. It's hard to get them all. And you, you know, as a, as a, as a, a game making team, the whole, you know, the teams kind of have to figure out where they want to fall on that line.

A difficult topic. You dedicated the book to your mom and dad and in particular you wrote to my father who died while I was finishing the book. What have you learned about life from your dad?

To show up, to be present, to Go to work every day. To love creative things. You know, he was a lawyer, but he is also a jazz musician. And he did both to the best of his abilities, you know, and he value family as more important than either of those things. You know, he was a present guy, I think, and, and you know, he loved books, always loved books, always loved but loved films. Loved mo music. Didn't, wasn't into video games, but liked that we were doing weird things.

Was he proud of you?

Yeah, I think so. I hope so. And he was, he was for, for a lawyer. He really venerated at some level, giving the man the, the, the quote unquote the man the finger. Like, you know, whenever life goes crazy. Yeah. He just was always on the side of the underdog and the ridiculous and, and I think that, you know, he always wanted to answer people back. Always give the silly comment. And I certainly, you know, taken that from him to my detriment probably. But it makes life more fun. Like he always would just say the obnoxious thing and just didn't give a fuck. And that was, you know, that was, I think that was probably quite inspiring.

So you have a bit of that in you

Unfortunately. So, yes. Not good at shutting up, not good at towing the line.

I think I speak for most of human civilization, that realization. Fortunately, you have that as part of, as part of who you are because it, it comes through your stories.

I think it made school difficult, you know, they sent me this very formal school. Yeah. That was like, it might as well have been set in the 1870s in the 1990s. And, but then they want, you know, I always get in trouble just for not, not for doing anything that wrong, just answering teachers back all of the time. Couldn't be quiet.

How often do you think about Mortality? Are you personally yourself afraid of death?

Well, my father passed away in May, so a lot more since then, obviously. I mean, I think about it a lot. Am I afraid of it? I don't know. Some days intensely and some days not at all. I would love to stay alive long enough to see my kids properly grow up and settled of course for them. I don't, aside from that, some days I feel, you know, spiritually connected to the universe and, and, and not afraid of death at all. And other days I feel like a sort of random piece of, of, of good luck who's gonna get struck down by an angry fate and turn to nothingness. And that terrifies me. I just,

What do you think about the nothingness? I mean that, that in itself is terrifying. Yeah,

That is terrifying. That, I mean, I'm, I I I tend to, I I tend to, you know, I've spent long periods of my life tormented by that stuff. The, the last few years. I tend to believe that is a purpose and a point to life. And that we have some kind of spiritual or soul based existence. Not, I'm not quite sure if it matters if there is a God or not. We should probably live our lives the same way either way. But I tend to think that that, you know, there is a metaphysical purpose to life and part of the, that purpose is to, you know, search for the purpose search. But at other points you can get, you know, if you read too much science, you get wrapped up in the nothingness of it all.

Also, there's a component to, to your brain when talking about weathering heights by Emily Bronte, you said that you have been by fortune struck with a bit of a capacity for the grandiosity of feeling. So you feel the world deeply, sometimes romantic, sometimes overly romantic. You've said, I like this line, feelings may destroy you, but they're the best thing we have. So that ability to feel the world, is that a gift or a curse for you? What do you think?

That's a really interesting question because it's obviously both, you know, times it's both or times it's one or the other. When things are going well, when you feel alive, when you feel like you are connected to things, when you are seeing beauty in people and, and joy and experiences, of course it's, it's, it's wonderful when you are feeling like, you know, bereft and set adrift by the world and that you can't connect it to it in some way, and you are lost and abandoned by God or consciousness or fate or whatever it is. It's awful. You know, when I feel like a dreadful hack, which is most of the time, you know, it's terrible. You'd rather not be doing this rubbish. And then sometimes you're working creatively and it feels good and you feel like you're doing the right thing and it feels fantastic. But that's not very often.

Do you think it's possible to have one without the other? No.

Yeah. No, of course not. When I think about growing up, to the extent that I am capable of growing up, it is about accepting the bad with the good from any situation or any aspect of myself, you know, going, okay, it's not perfect or I'm not perfect.

You, you said you often feel like a hack. Is that that self-critical part of your brain? Is that a feature or a bug?

That's an, I think it's the, that that new thing that we're gonna lean into the bug feature. Yeah, it's both, isn't it? I mean it's, it's, it cannot lead that self-critical brain I think lots of people suffer from. And, and I think the internet is designed to induce, if you didn't have it before, you will have it after being online. It's clearly can become a bug, but it also can give you drive and a lack of complacency. So it can, can also become a feature.

I had a pretty intense argument with Paul Conte, who's a legendary psychiatrist student of the mind about this. He worked with many famous creative people and he, he thinks that that negative voice is not at all needed for creative genius. And I thought, I know awfully a lot of creative people that have that voice.

I'd rather not have it. But I certainly have lived with it this far that there's a danger that negativity for me that negativity and consciousness become the same thing. You know? And sometimes I have to fight to not just be perpetually negative and that can be part of the human struggle for lots of people and certainly has been for me. I think if you are trying to do, you know, good stuff and you are reflective inevitably and, and, you know, you live in this world of constant, constant criticisms by the internet. Of course, you know, everyone who ever puts something on the internet, be it a picture of themselves or any kind of work they've made or whatever it is, is gonna get 50 good comments and one bad comment, remember the bad comment. So that, and that, that becomes fuel for the negative voice. I dunno anyone that's strong enough not to, you know, we all, you know, some level you should just measure stuff that stuff in, in weight, not in, not in quality, but of course we just focus on the quality.

And I do think in general, as you get older, that's the real challenge for people. You, you see the different trajectories people choose to take, but it's easy to slip into cynicism and negativity into this. The s's notes from underground nihilistic kind of worldview.",,,"Dan Houser is co-founder of Rockstar Games and is a legendary creative mind behind Grand Theft Auto (GTA) and Red Dead Redemption series of video games.

"for lots of people and certainly has been for me. I think if you are trying to do, you know, good stuff and you are reflective inevitably and, and, you know, you live in this world of constant, constant criticisms by the internet. Of course, you know, everyone who ever puts something on the internet, be it a picture of themselves or any kind of work they've made or whatever it is, is gonna get 50 good comments and one bad comment, remember the bad comment. So that, and that, that becomes fuel for the negative voice. I dunno anyone that's strong enough not to, you know, we all, you know, some level you should just measure stuff that stuff in, in weight, not in, not in quality, but of course we just focus on the quality.

And I do think in general, as you get older, that's the real challenge for people. You, you see the different trajectories people choose to take, but it's easy to slip into cynicism and negativity into this. The s's notes from underground nihilistic kind of worldview. I think the heroic action to take with time is to become more optimistic, to see more good, to, I think that there's probably a hero's journey of being extremely self-critical at first for, for the, the, the, the first maybe half of your life or two third. And then while maintaining some self-critical aspects, just so you stay humble, start to see the good in everything around you, in other people in the world, and even maybe every once in a while on a weekend in yourself.

I hope so. I mean, that's what I've been, I could not be more cynical. I think you put that beautifully. I could not be more cynical than I was as a child, you know, I could not see goodness anywhere. I, I couldn't see, you know, I don't think late 1970s to early 1990s, England was a great, makes a great, you know, optimism and naivety. It was brutal. And I was brutal. I was brutal within it. And I think I become much more naive and, and, and try to become more innocent in some ways and always try to see the flawed good in people. You know, I've tried to, I've had to force myself to be like that because, you know, the other way is not fun. It's not nice to to it's not nice to not be nice.

As a brief aside, you had a wonderful conversation with Ryan McCaffery at La Comic-Con. I've been a big fan of his for a long time. He writes amazing stuff at IGN and he has a great podcast. Everybody should go listen to it. I really enjoyed it. Plus I got to attend a ComicCon and just be there in the audience. And like we were saying offline, the La ComicCon, it's the first ComicCon I've been to. It's just all kinds of real genuine nerds. Good hearted. Oh, it's

Fascinating. Yeah.

Brilliant. It's just so much kindness and goodness and just simple joy in being a fan of a thing

Was there. Yeah. Which is what those things are all about. Yeah.

Okay. So let's talk about some of the greatest books of all time. And I should also give a shout out to an excellent podcast you do with Sonya Walger, who's a friend of yours, but she had a great podcast. She has guests picked their five favorite most impactful books and so on. You picked five fiction books, one for each decade of your life. For the audience, they should go listen to that conversation. But you picked Winter Holiday by Arthur Ransom. Second one was Withering Heights by Emily Bronte, then tenders the Night by F Scott Fitzgerald, the Thin Red Line by James Jones and Middle March by George Elliott. But just zooming out, reflecting back on that conversation, what do you think if an alien came, what are, what are some candidates for books that you'll recommend to them?

Middle March, it's the March best novel written in English, war and Peace. It's the one of the best novels written in Russian, I would argue. I think both of those are, because if you've only got one book, you want a long book. Yeah, true. And, and, and they're both, both that kind of, it's something I was always trying to put into games and, and you know, that feeling of all of life is here. Hmm. You know, you've got love, death, violence, romance, the whole human experience in different ways. So I think that that there's something amazing about, you know, vanity Fair. I used to used to love the novel, not the, not the magazine. 'cause same thing all of life is here.

You also spoke highly of, of Scott Fitzgerald and Hemingway.

I was obsessed by them in my twenties. Yeah.

Completely obsessed as one must be. Yeah,

Absolutely. And I think them as a double act is so amazing. You know, one helped discover the other and then died first and then suddenly it died in, in obscurity and then was rediscovered as a genius while the other one was still alive and falling into, not obscurity, but into decline. I think it's that, that their relationship is itself very novelistic.

That, that by the way is a phenomena of writing. Maybe no longer, maybe still that, you know, people like Franz Kafka who died in obscurity, like all these writers who died in obscurity, not nobody knows them and they become famous later. Yeah. That is just so interesting. That's such an interesting, you know, that Franz Ka and, and Franz lwqZIr in particular is fascinating because he wanted all of his work to be burnt, like destroyed. So that incur, speaking of the critical voice is just, and I, I think he's one of the, one of the best writers of the 20th century. Of course the dystopian novels are really interesting. 1984, brave New World

Love 1984 had never listened to it or read it. And then I think I did it on Talking book, or I maybe read it, I can't remember. During COVID and became, I think I did both became obsessed by it and it's got the elements of that creeping into a Better Paradise. But it's so good. I hadn't realized how good it was. Yeah. And it's so of the moment,

It's almost like because of its fame and Yeah. It, it's almost like cliche and you think of the

Caricature Yeah. The English and I remember the year 1984. Yeah. And you're like, oh, this is, I remember the song, you know, there's too much. Yeah. Too much. It can't be that good. And then it was that I had came to it completely cold, just, oh, I should get work my way through this. 'cause it's another classic I haven't read. And then it's, it's incredible.

And the book I've read more than any other book is Animal Farm by George More. Well, I don't know why exactly, but the childlike fairytale telling of totalitarianism. Well

You grew up in a communist country.

Yeah. Yeah. Maybe that's it. The roots of it. You

Know, I, I remember, you know, I was a kid in the Cold War in London and we were always terrified of Eastern Europeans. You were gonna come and kill us all. And then I I ended up marrying a pole. Yeah. And, and I was, we we were. And and we had Ukrainians, you know, who, who, who, who worked, worked for us and worked with us. And I was, we were sitting a few years ago sitting around a campfire in upstate New York surround with the fires built by our old nanny's husband who's Ukrainian. And he'd been in the Red Army. And I was like, history is so strange that you end up, the Red Army used to be the ultimate enemy. And they're like, we're now just hanging out with everything changes. You think these things, you think these things are permanent and they're really not. Yeah. You know, we face some of that now where you think these structures are permanent and they're gonna change.

And you also mentioned the three Great World War II books are the thin Red Line Life and Fate by VA Grossman and the End of the Affair, Graham Green. What makes for Great War book?

I think World War II is interesting because it affects everywhere, obviously. And so you can get all these different kinds of stories and there's so many good, I was just trying to come up with a range of one American, one British, one Eastern European, just to get, just to get different perspectives. But there's so many amazing World War II books around all kinds of stories. I think the most complete one because it is this all of life being there probably is life and fate, which is amazing.

And it was written by VA Grossman, he experienced Stalingrad firsthand. And there's also just a deep philosophical component.

And the Bit Intra Blinker is one of the most harrowing sections of any book I ever read. And it really, almost more than any other piece of art around the Holocaust made me feel what you would feel like at that moment. And he iss just incredible piece of humanism.

And also just, I mean, man's Search for Meaning by Viktor Frankl. Yeah. Oh yeah. It, it seems like that context reveals in the most pure way human nature and like what kind of, you know, and man's search for meaning is when everything is taken from you, you know, the little remains of love for, in this case, his wife is the thing that is a little flame that burns. And let's say a Grossman is small acts of kindness is the thing that allows the human spirit to persist.

I love the bit in life and fate when you get, obviously it's in this Stalinist period. And so the, they're all losing, they all know that the, that what they thought was gonna be wonderful about the revolution isn't gonna happen. So there's a whole, and everyone's scared of being killed by Stalin 'cause it's Post the Purges. But then you get these guys and they're trapped in a building, fighting in Stalingrad. And so they know at this moment they're dead anyway. And they get to live like pure perfect Marxist communists Away from Staling Rule is nonsense. And I thought that section's incredible. 'cause you realize, like in some ways, in all of its horrors, the most disappointing thing about the 20th century in some ways was the absolute failure of communism. You know, it was because it was such a, you know, quote unquote beautiful idea. And it just did not work time and time again. And these people who fought for it and then saw it not working, I think they're sort of fascinating characters. Yeah. You know, all of the, all of the revolutionaries from 1917 that were then killed by Stalin, which was all of them, apart from him and him and him and Lennon.

And that was, you know, people in modern day politics talk about communism. Like it's trivially as trivial that it would lead to atrocities. But I don't think it's that trivial. It's, it's this idealism of human of humans. Yeah. Of it's like, why, you know, why can't basically, why can't we all get along? There's a real compassion behind, there's real love. And what you realize is there is, it's the real study, the 20th century of human nature that unfortunately at scale, that kind of compassion is abused by centralized power. So there's a dictator always in that, in that context, in in those, given that set of technologies, a dictator arises and does the opposite of what the, the, the promise of the ideal is supposed to be.

Well, I think I thought a lot about that then. 'cause I was taught by all these disappointed communists, you know, after 89, all of these English communists, you know, all like having to access, discovering all these atrocities that happened in, you know, so it was, it always fascinated me. And then you think about complexities or where one's own values are in the modern moment. And I I say, you know, without, from, from from EE and whether either of them any what we would call left now or call right now, does it have any bearing on, on the sort of communist era of those words? And I would say probably not. I think things have changed. But fundamentally the one value that I would go, I would think is worth fighting for is go whenever either side starts to move towards thought control, move away. Yeah. That's never the right outcome. The never right outcome is, oh, you've said the wrong thing, you should be removed now. That should never ever be a, a thing we should lean towards.

Yeah. It does seem like freedom, individual freedom is a prerequisite for

Happiness.

For, for happiness for in the flourishing of a larger society. Yeah. So there's, like you said, 1984 is pretty good. I mean, it's a caricature, but it is brilliant. It's, it's quite, it's actually also just a good story. That's my criticism of Brave New World. It's just poorly written. But I like Brave New World probably applies more to the 21st century than does 1984. I dunno.

I think 1984 with the, with the fake wars. Yeah. And the way that it revealed that everything and it was a setup for him. Yeah. There's something, if he could have seen the internet, there's something, it's like, it's like an analog internet. That world, they build around the main character.

What advice would you give to a young person today about, let's say career? How, how to have a career they can be proud of. How they can have a life to be proud of. You've had a non-standard life.

I've had a lucky life in which I have fought to mess things up. And fate has always thrown me a bone.

You've traveled in South America and had hobos chase you with machetes. Yeah,

Yeah,

Yeah,

Yeah.

So that happened. That

Was a poor series of poor life decisions. Yeah. And I, I ran, I ran away, you know, I was, I mean I ran away to South America. It was a poor decision. I ran away from the guy with a knife. That was a good decision. Yeah. I came to America. That was a good decision. I ran, came to LA That's, I think, been a good decision. It's been fun to see a different side of America and being a different creative environment. LA is still amazing for creativity and entertainment, the wider entertainment industry stuff. I think that's been fun. What would I say? I would say when you get a chance, take it. That was one thing I did do well at. When I got got chances, I was good at taking them. I would say, do not worry too young about your career. I would say worry about having a rounded intellectual inner life. 'cause you're gonna spend the whole of your life in your own head. So the more interesting you find your own head, the more interesting you find the world, the less you are gonna annoy yourself. So I would say I would, I would say do not do a vocational degree as an undergraduate. That's been my, I would say do something else. Do something, you know, random and then focus afterwards. That would be, I think I, I was advocating against the obsession that people had about four years ago with STEM subjects and now AI's gonna make 'em all irrelevant anyway perhaps. So, you know, I, it's interesting to see everything changes. Jobs are not that hard. You know, turn up, be enthusiastic, be turn, turn up in, in person, be enthusiastic. Help people say you'll be finding in any job people, you know.

Did Joes know when the chance to take showed up? Like this is okay, this is interesting, this is new, this is different.

Not always, no. But I did the, the big times where the chance to move to America. For me, that was a big moment. My life was a messy, those

Weird timing. So I I I read that Sam wrote you an email. What? Yeah, in Souther.

I literally, I was in South America in Columbia when there was a war raging there. Yep. I was making a series of very poor life choices and a lack of life skills. Age 25. My latest poor choice was to get up too early. 'cause the police didn't start work till nine. But the mugger started at eight. And so I was out walking along the beach at eight and these guys, this raster turned up who I'd been talking to the day before, trying to talk to me. And then two guys came up to talk to him and I couldn't tell if they were trying to mug him 'cause he owed them money or he'd bought me to them. But I did notice one of them had a machete and now they had a kind of broken gun. So I thought this is not good. And I ran off sprinted down the beach in my, in my silly shoes and got to the chance once in my life to run over to a road run, jump into a taxi and scream, you know, take me anywhere. I feel like I'm an action movie.",,,"Dan Houser is co-founder of Rockstar Games and is a legendary creative mind behind Grand Theft Auto (GTA) and Red Dead Redemption series of video games.

"timing. So I I I read that Sam wrote you an email. What? Yeah, in Souther.

I literally, I was in South America in Columbia when there was a war raging there. Yep. I was making a series of very poor life choices and a lack of life skills. Age 25. My latest poor choice was to get up too early. 'cause the police didn't start work till nine. But the mugger started at eight. And so I was out walking along the beach at eight and these guys, this raster turned up who I'd been talking to the day before, trying to talk to me. And then two guys came up to talk to him and I couldn't tell if they were trying to mug him 'cause he owed them money or he'd bought me to them. But I did notice one of them had a machete and now they had a kind of broken gun. So I thought this is not good. And I ran off sprinted down the beach in my, in my silly shoes and got to the chance once in my life to run over to a road run, jump into a taxi and scream, you know, take me anywhere. I feel like I'm an action movie. And there guys chasing after the machete and the taxi driver looks back, sees the dude with the machete and goes, see Amigos and I, they're not my friends. Get me outta here. And then I, he drove me up the street into a, the town was, it was kind of between the old town and the new town in Cartia. And I got out of the car and then cut my foot on a rock that was the sum total of my injuries. And then went to an internet cafe, 'cause this was probably late 98. And got the chance to come and work on a game for six weeks in New York. And I was like, well if I stay in South America much longer, I'm gonna get myself killed. 'cause this was, I was getting into silly stuff. And so I went to New York and they're just starting Rockstar. And so I got to sort of write the mission statements and, and whatnot there and, and help set the tone for that. And just ended up staying, you know, had to come and go a bit. Well, well Visas got sorted out and then just ended up staying for ah, stay for a year. 'cause New York's pretty fun. They actually was not that, this was the height of Giuliani before he was a maniac. So he, you couldn't, when you went to bars you were told you couldn't dance. 'cause they were trying to clamp down on New York being fun. So it was actually less fun than London. But there's still a great energy in New York and got exposed to the kind of madness of New York capitalism,

By the way, as we hear sirens in the background, that always makes me think of New York. Yeah, of course. Whenever I'm in New York, there's always

Sirens, steam coming out the floor. People screaming at you. I mean, you get people screaming at you in LA at least.

Yeah. But it's more distri, it's more it's spread out. Spread

Out. You can get a bit more quiet here. Yeah. And I love the energy, you know, it was great to work hard and then be able to go out for dinner late and, and New York was really, really a fun experience for me.

You work with your brother Sam for many years. What do you admire about him as a creative mind, as a human being?

His drive and his vision early on to see what video games could become. He was the one who understood that video games were the next big thing. And I think that was, you know, people would laugh in our face about that in those days. And so to have someone that was strong saying, no, no, we stick, stick, stay to the course and then having the confidence to push through with these big projects.

Are you excited for the Future of video games? Yeah,

I think I, I completely, I still, I still look at, I'm glad you spoken so I mean, you've spoken so kindly about our work, about the stuff that I did and the stuff the whole teams did is wonderful. But I just look at it and see problems and see things that we can make do better. You know, I think it was always try each time do it better. And I've got, you know, some of the stuff we're working on now is gonna do stuff that people haven't really seen before. And I think it's just, I think the games can get so much better. They can feel so much more alive. All the, they can be better at storytelling and feel more alive and feel like, you know, their systems. All the stuff, the, the component parts we talked about. You can, we can both make each of those parts better and tie 'em together better. I think it's the technology, it's all, to me it still feels like it's only just beginning. You know, it's been, it's been cinema evolved from like 1900, 18 95 whenever it was until they invented talking in 1930 or whenever that was. It's not that. And then it's kind of found its modern form and then by 39 they're shooting in color and that's basically a modern film is no different from a 1939 film. But with games I still think we've got a long way to go. The tech, there's so many different parts of the tech that it's still got a long way to go and you can go in all different fun directions.

I just wish, I know you said video games take a lot less than they possibly they they could, but I just wish it was faster. Like, you've already made me me fall in love with Absurd verse and you've made me fall in love with the Better Paradise. And now I am going to sit the pressed realize I'm gonna have to wait. I can of course read well

We should have some little short cartoons coming out in a while for Absurd Averse and more stuff coming in the next period. But yeah, it just takes, it takes a little bit of time. And I think, I mean movies, you big movies are four years plus from start to end. Yeah. You know, with all the legal stuff at the start, you know, we'll be about the same.

Yeah. And certain movies from Idea to Completion, I mean take 10 plus years and some of the

Great, yeah. I mean a lot of that's just that development process. Yeah. That is really sometimes feels like it's designed to not make stuff

A bit more of a specific advice. But on the topic of video games, what advice would you give to, to maybe independent video game creators that are dreaming of creating great games? They're inspired by Red Dead, they're spying of all the incredible open worlds and narratives you've created. Like how's it possible to have a chance of doing something like that?

I mean it's part of the two, two ways. Try and do it cheaply for with, with yourself and a small group or join a company that you think is doing it the right way. You know, and I think there's upside suite of those. I think if you want to make something that's cinematic AI is gonna change some of this. But if you want to make something cinematic, you need resources, you can still make something that's really interesting that isn't super cinematic, but it's an interesting experience in some ways. But the secondary involving actors and motion capture and one of those big experiences is gonna cost some money. So therefore the, if you wanna do that, you've got to figure out what companies you want to work out and figure out how you get to work there.

Do you have, do you have hope for AI helping with some of the video, some of the video generation, some of the world generation, some of the open world assistance in, in generating the world?

Yes. Limited. Absolutely. If used correctly, it'll be a great tool if used incorrectly, it will lead to loads of generic stuff. Yeah. You know, I've been in games for 29 years and all the time the piece of tech that's gonna make making games much easier and much cheaper is about to turn up. And all that's happened is the games have got much better and way more expensive. So I'm always nervous about saying, finally we have that bit of tech that makes our lives easier. But it looks as if it might be able to do that when you use it in the right way, if you use it, you know, if you use it to try and as a substitute for creativity, it's gonna be really generic.

Big ridiculous question. What's the meaning of this whole thing we have going on here of life of existence? Why are we here

To watch the universe? The easiest, plausible answer is we are designed by the universe to watch itself and to comment on it in interesting ways.

Consistently more and more interesting ways. Yeah. What role does love play as part of that?

It's the only thing that makes it possibly worth doing. Everything else, everything material is irrelevant. So the only things of value are these immaterial things. You know, I do think metaphysics always trumps physics for me.

Well, Dan, from the bottom of my heart, speaking of love, thank you. What

A pleasure. Thank you ma'am.

Thank you for everything you've created in this world. Me and millions of diehard fans of your games are forever grateful. I know there's a lot of people that would like to say thank you to you,

Just to be clear. 'cause I always like to make this very clear. Yeah. It was never me. Yeah. It was always me sat alongside people with actual real talent who did amazing things.

Well I, I hope you keep being self-critical and creating awesome stuff in the world and we can't wait to keep exploring the worlds you create. And thank you so much for talking today, brother.

Thank you for having me. What a privilege.

"Joe Rogan podcast. Check out

The Joe Rogan experience.

Train by Day. Joe Rogan podcast. By night, all day.

Exactly.

Just every morning.

What are Jeff Bezos is doing? He's doing some,

Definitely doing some

Testosterone.

He

Looks jacked.

He looks jacked, right?

Yeah. But he didn't like, quick, quick, quick.

Yeah. He got jacked quick at

Age. Like at 50. At age 59 In less than a year, he, he went from pencil net geek to looking like a, like the rock? Yeah.

Like a little miniature alpha fella.

Yeah. Yeah. Like, like his neck got bigger than his head. Yeah, he

Got

Very quick. But then like his earlier pictures, his neck's like a noodle.

I support this activity. Just see him going in this direction,

Which is fine. And his voice dropped like two octaves.

I want you to move in that direction as well. I think we can achieve this. I, I,

I mean, I, I should

I I think we can achieve Giga Chad. That's what people

Called it. Where is that guy?

Bele? I don't know where he is.

That's like a real guy.

The artist? Yeah. No.

Oh, giga Chad. Oh, giga Chad.

Yeah. I don't know if that's a real guy. It's hard to tell.

It is a real guy. It is a real guy. Yeah.

He's got the crazy jaw and like perfect sculpted hair. Yeah. Yeah.

Well, I mean, they may have exaggerated a little bit, but probably, but no, I think, I think he actually just kinda looked like that in reality. Oh. So like he, he's a pretty unique looking individual.

I think we can achieve this. That guy right there. That's a real guy.

That's real. Dude. I think

I always thought that was CGI.

No, I, I think one of the, I think the upper right one is not him. That's not that

One to the left of that. Like, that's real. No, that's, that's artificial, bro. That's fake. That's got that uncanny valley feel to it, doesn't it?

It's, it's not impossible.

No, no. It's not impossible to achieve, but it's not, it's not possible to maintain that kind of leanness.

That's a crazy No, I mean, that's like, like you're, you're, you're also at that point, you're, they're there. He's dehydrating and all sorts of things.

Oh, it's based on a real person. Yeah.

Yeah. Based on, right.

But it's not a real person. What

Does he really look like?

Like those images, I think are bullshit. Some of 'em are real. Is that real? Okay. That real. That looks real. That looks a really Jack bodybuilder. Yeah. Yeah. That looks real. Like, that's achievable. But there's a few of those images where you're just like, what's going on here?

Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Totally. Well, I mean, you see, you see it Is that, is that the ice? That's

The real dude.

Well, there's that, that, that Icelandic dude who's Thor.

Oh yeah. The guy who jumps in the frozen lakes and shit. Yeah. Well,

The, the guy who played the mountain. Oh,

That guy that is, yeah. That

Is like a, that, that is like a, a mutant strong human. Yes. Like, like he would be in like the X-Men or something, you know, we were hanging out. I mean, he's, he's just like, not like, and, and, and then is that, you know, that I've seen that meme tent and tent bag. No. You know how like, it's like, it's really hard to get the tent tent in the tent. Oh, right,

Right. That's true. Then

There's a picture of of him and his girlfriend with

Oh, right. That's hilarious. Yeah. Yeah. That's, I don't know how

It gets in there, you know, it's like, seems too small. But

I met Brian Shaw. Brian Shaw's like the world's most powerful man. Yeah. And he's almost seven feet tall. He's 400 pounds. And his, his bone density is one in 500 million people. So there's one, it's like, there's like maybe 16, 16 people.

I mean, he dense

Bones. He's an enormous human being. Okay. Like a legitimate giant, just like that guy. Yeah. Yeah. But we met him. He was hanging out with us in the green room of the mothership. But it's like, okay, if this is like David and Goliath days, like Yeah. Yeah. This is an actual giant, like the giant of the Bible.

Once in a while, they get a super giant person. This is a

Real, a real one. Like not tall, skinny basketball player. Yeah, yeah. Like a seven foot, 400 pound powerlifter.

Like, you don't want to especially

Look at him. That's the guy. See if there's a photo of him standing next to like a regular human. I was trying to get this. There it is. Yeah. That's him right there. Like,

There's like, there's like one of him with next to standing next to Arnold and stuff. Yeah. And it's where, and Arnold, everyone, everyone just looks tiny. I mean, I think he's a pretty cool dude actually.

Oh, Brian's very cool. Very smart, too. Unusually, you know, you expect anybody to be that big, it's gotta be a moron. Yeah. But no.

Yeah, there was, there was Andre the Giant who was awesome. Yeah. He was great in Princess Brian. No,

He was just awesome. Period. Yeah. Yeah. So we were talking about this interview with Sam Altman and Tucker, and I was like, we should probably just talk about this on the air, because it is one of the craziest interviews I think I've ever seen in my life. Yeah. Where Tucker starts bringing up this guy who was Yeah.

A whistleblower or whatever. A

Whistleblower Yeah. Who, you know, committed suicide, but doesn't look like it. And, and he's talking to Sam Altman about this, and Sam Altman's like, are you accusing me? He's like, no, no, no, I'm not. I'm just saying. I I think someone killed him. Yeah.

And like, and it should be investigated. Yeah. Not just drop the case.

It seems like

That they just dropped the case. Yeah, yeah. Yeah. It seems, but his parents think he was murdered. Yeah. The wires to a security camera were cut blood

In two rooms,

Blood in two rooms. Someone else's wig was in the room. Someone

Else's wig. Wig, wig. Yes. Yes. Not, not normal. His wig not normal to have a wig laying around. Yes.

And, and he ordered DoorDash right before allegedly committing suicide. Yeah. Which is seems unusual, you know? Yeah. It's like, you know, let's, I'm gonna order pizza on second. Thoughts, I'll kill myself. Is it seems like that's a very rapid change in mindset. It's

Very weird. And especially the parents have, they, they don't believe he committed suicide at all.

Has no note or anything. No.

Yeah. It seems pretty fucked up. And you know, the idea that a whistleblower for an enormous AI company that's worth billions of dollars might get whacked. That's not outside the pale.

I mean, it's straight out of a movie. Right.

Out of a movie, but Right out of a movie is real sometimes. Yeah. Right.

Exactly. It's like, right. It's a little weird that I think, I think they should do a proper investigation. Like what's the downside on that proper investigation?

Right. No, yeah, for sure. Yeah. Yeah. But the whole exchange is so bizarre.

Yeah. Yeah. It is. It's

Sam Altman's reaction to being accused of murder is bizarre.

Look, I don't know if he's guilty, but it's not possible to look more guilty, so I'm like,

Or look more weird. Yeah. You know, maybe it's just his social thing. Like maybe he's just odd with confrontation and it just goes blank, you know? But if, if somebody was accusing me of killing Jamie, like, if Jamie was a whistleblower and Jamie got whacked, and then I'd be like, wait, what are you, what are you, are you accusing me of killing my friend? Like, what the fuck are you talking about? I would, I would be a little bit more irate.

Yeah, yeah. Exactly. You know, it'd be,

I would be a little upset.

Yeah. It'd be like, well, you'd be like, you'd certainly in insist on a thorough investigation. Yeah. As opposed to trying to sweep it under the rug.

Yeah. I wouldn't assume that he got that he committed suicide. I would be suspicious if, if Tucker was telling me that aspect of the story, I'd be like, that does seem like a murder. Fuck. We should look into this.

I mean, all signs point to it being a murder. Not, not saying, you know, Tim Malman had anything to do with the motor, but

Blood in two rooms,

But blood in two rooms. Like Yeah, this, the wires, the security camera and the DoorDash being ordered right before suicide. No suicide note, his parents think he was murdered. And the people that I know who knew him said he was not suicidal. So I'm like, this, why would you jump to the conclusion parents

Just sued the

Landlord? They sued the son's landlord, alleged the owners and the managers of their son, San Francisco apartment building were part of a widespread coverup of his desk.

The landlord.

Yeah. There's a bunch of weird, they said there was like packages missing from the building. Some people said they saw packages still being delivered and then all of a sudden they all disappeared.

Huh. Fewer. But that could, future reasons could be people steal people's packages all the time.

The porch pirate situation. Yeah.

Yeah.

It says they failed to

Safeguard also. I mean, the amount of trauma those poor parents have gone through with their son dying like that. I mean, it must God bless 'em. And how could they be stay sane? Yeah. After something like that. They're probably, they're so grief stricken. Who knows what this episode is brought to you by the farmer's dog. I think we can all agree that eating highly processed food for every meal isn't optimal. So why is processed food the status quo for dog food? Because that's what kibble is, an ultra processed food, but a healthy alternative exists. The farmer's dog, they make fresh food for dogs. And what does it look like? Real meat and vegetables that are gently cooked to retain vital nutrients and help avoid any of the bad stuff that comes with ultra processing. And it's not just random ingredients thrown together. Their food is formulated by on staff board certified vet nutritionists. These people are experts on dog nutrition and they're all in on fresh food. The farmer's dog also does something unique. They portion out the food to your dog's nutritional needs. This ensures that you don't over feeded them. Making weight management easy research shows that dogs kept at a healthy weight can live up to two and a half years longer.

Yeah. He, he should have asked if Uhon killed himself.

Yeah.

That's the, the Cash Patel thing.

Where's the Cash

Patel? Dan Bonino the, they were trying to convince everybody of that, like, okay.

The guards weren't there and the cameras stopped working and you know,

The guards were asleep, the cameras weren't working. He had a, a giant steroid up bodybuilder guy that he was sharing a cell with that was a murderer who was a bad cop. Like all of it's kind of nuts. Yeah. All of it's kind of nuts like that. He would just kill himself rather than reveal all of his billionaire friends.

Yeah.

And then

Did you see Tim Dylan talking to Chris Cuomo about this? Because

He like I did. He like, yeah. Chris Cuomo just looked so stupid.

Tim just listed off

All the, Tim just, and he is like, I agree. It is strange. Like, of course it's strange, Chris, Jesus Christ, you can't just go with the tide. You gotta think things through. And if you think that one through, you're like, I don't think he killed himself. Nobody does. You'd have to work for an intelligence agency to think he killed himself.

It does. It does seem unlikely. It seems

Highly unlikely.

Highly,

Highly unlikely. All roads highly unlikely. All roads point to murder. Yes. To point to They had to get rid of him because he knew too much. Whatever the fuck he was doing. Yeah. Whatever kind of an asset he was, whatever thing he was up to, you know, it was apparently very effective. Yes. And a lot of people were compromised. You see, your boy Bill Gates is now saying climate change is not a big deal. It's like, relax everybody. I know. I scared the fuck outta you for the last decade and a half, but eh, we're gonna be fine.

Yeah. I mean, you know, as we was saying, as I was saying just before coming into the studio with, you know, it like every day there's some crazy wild new thing that's happening. Yes. It's like, it feels like reality's accelerating.

Yeah. It's every day and every day. It's like more and more ridiculous. Yeah. To the point where the simulation is more and more undeniable. Yeah.

Yeah. It really feels like simulation. You know? It's like, come on. What are the odds that this could be the case? You know? Are

You paying attention at all to three I Atlas? Are you

Watching on Oh, does the, the comet?

Yeah. Whatever it is.

Yeah. Yeah. I mean, I mean, one thing I can say is like, look, I, if, if I was aware of any evidence of aliens, you, Joe, you have my word. I'll come on your show and I will reveal it on the show. Okay. Yeah. That's a good deal. Yeah. It's a pretty good deal. I believe you.

Yeah. Yeah.

Thank you. Appreciate that. I'll, I'll stick to, I I keep my, you know, keep my promises, so, alright.

Yeah. I'll

Hold you. Do that. Yeah. Yeah. I don't And, and I'm never committing suicide. To be clear, I don't think you'll either. On camera guys. I am never committing suicide

Ever. If someone says you committed suicide, I will fight tooth and nail. Thank

You. I'll

Fight tooth and nail. Thank you. I will. I'll not believe it. I will not believe it. The thing about the three I Atlas is it's,

That's a hell of a name actually. Yeah.

It's a third. It

Sounds, it sounds like third eye or something.

Yeah, it does.

Three

I is a third. It's only the third interstellar object that's detected. Okay. Yeah. Avi Loeb

Third eye. Yes. Yeah.

Avi Loeb was on the podcast a couple days ago talking about it. Yeah.

It could be on, I don't know. But

Apparently today they're saying that it's changed course. Did you see that Jamie? No. Avi Loeb said something today. I'll send it to you. I know. It's on Reddit rapidly

Brightens and gets blue.

Here you go, Jamie. I'll send it to you right now. It's fascinating. It's fascinating also because it's made almost entirely of nickel, whatever it is. Yeah. And the only way that exists here is industrial alloys. Apparently.

There must No, there are, there are, there are definitely comets that and asteroids that are made primarily of nickel. Oh, really? Yeah. So the, the, the places where you mine nickel on earth is actually where there was an asteroid or comet that hit earth that was in nickel rich, you know, as Oh, wow. Nick Nickel rich.

Right. Oh, giant nickel Rich, rich deposit.

Yeah. That's the, that's, that's, it's coming. Those are from impacts. You definitely didn't wanna be there at the time because anything would've been obliterated. Right. But that's, that's where the, the sources of nickel and cobalt are these days.",,,"Elon Musk is a business magnate, designer, and engineer known for his work in electric vehicles, private spaceflight, and artificial intelligence.

So this is avio a few hours ago, the first hint of non gravitational acceleration that something other than gravity is affecting its acceleration. Meaning something is affecting its trajectory beyond gravity was indicated. Interesting. Dun dun. So it's mostly nickel, very little iron, which he was saying is on earth only exists in alloys, but whatever, you know, you're dealing with another planet. There's,

There's, there are, there are ca there are cases where there's very nickel rich asteroid meter. Right. That, that, that's, that happened

For something from space.

Yeah. This, it's something. Yeah. Yeah. It doesn't mean it's, it be, it'll be very sort of heavy spaceship to be make it all out of nickel. Oh yeah.

And fucking huge, the size of Manhattan and all nickel. That's kind of nuts. Yeah.

That's a heavy spaceship. That's

A real problem. If it hits

Yes. No, we would like obliterate a continent type thing. Yeah. Maybe, maybe was,

Yeah. Probably kill most of human life, if not all of us.

I haven't, like, depends on what the, the total mass is. But there's, I mean, the thing is like in the fossil record, there are, you know, there's like arguably, arguably five major extinction events, like the biggest one of which is the perine extinction, where almost all life was eliminated that, that actually occurred over several million, several million years. The, there's the Jurassic, I think Jurassic is, I think that one's pretty definitively an asteroid and, but there's, but there's been five major ex extinction events. But, but what they don't count are really the ones that merely take outta continent. So the merely Yeah. 'cause that, that, because those don't really show up on the fossil record, you know? Right. So unless it's enough to cause a, a, you know, mass extinction event throughout earth, it, it doesn't show up on, you know, in a fossil record that's 200 million years old. So the Yeah. But, but there've been, there've been many, many impacts that would've sort of destroyed all life on, you know, a let's say half of North America or something like that. There many such impacts through the course of history.

Yeah. And there's nothing we could do about it right now. Yeah.

There was one that hits, there's a one that hits Siberia and destroyed I think a few hundred square miles.

Oh, that's the tunguska. Yeah, yeah, yeah. That's the one from the 1920s. Right? Yeah. Yeah. That's the one that coincides with that meteor, that comets storm that we go through every June and every November that they think is responsible for that younger driest impact. Yeah. Yeah. All that shit's crazy. Thank you. Before we go any further for letting us have a tour, SpaceX, you're welcome. And letting us be there for the rock and launch. Sure. One of the absolute coolest things I've ever seen in my life. And we, we've, we were, we thought it was only like, I thought it was a half a mile. Jamie's like it was a mile away. Turned out it's almost two miles away. Yeah. Yeah. And you feel it in your chest. Yeah.

It's, you

Have to wear ear plugs

Very

Intense. And you feel it in your chest and it's two miles away. Yeah. It was fucking amazing. Yeah. And then to go with you up into the command center and to watch all the starlink satellites with all the different cameras and all in real time. Yeah. As it made its way all the way to Australia. How many minutes? Like 35, 40 minutes. Yeah. Wild. Watch it touchdown in Australia. Yeah. Fucking crazy. It was crazy. It amazing. Yeah. Yeah. Absolutely amazing. The

Start's awesome. And anyone can go watch the launch actually. So you can just go to South Padre Island and get as a great view of the launch. So it's like where a lot of spring breakers go. Mm. But, but we'll, we're flying pretty frequently out of star base in South Texas and we, we, we formally incorporated it as a city. So it's, yeah. It's actually a, a legally a a an actual legal city star v Texas. It's not that often you hear like, Hey, we made a city, you know, that used to be like the, like in, in the old days, like a startup would be, you go and gather a bunch of people and say, Hey, let's go make a town, literally. Right. That was like, that would've been startups in in in in the old days.

Or a country. Yeah.

Or a country. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Actually,

If you tried doing that today, there'd be a real problem.

Yeah. Like, maybe think's so much, so much set in stone on the country front, these things, you might be able to pull

It off. You might be able to pull it off. If you got a, a solid island, you might be able to pull it off. You know, I think it's

Probably,

You know, like, like at Larry, like make a new country lan country. Yeah. You could probably, is this it right here?

You could put, if you put enough effort into it, you could make a new country.

This is one of the different ones. This is the one of the ones that you catch, right? Or is that one? Yeah, that, that's

The booster. So that's the super heavy booster. So that's one with the booster's got 33 engines that, that in. It's, you know, by version four that will have about 10,000 tons of thrust. You know, right now it's about seven, 8,000 tons of thrust. But it's, that's the largest flying object ever made.

I had to explain to someone, they were going, why do they blow up all the time if he's so smart? 'cause there was this, there was this fucking idiot on television. Some guy was being interviewed and they were talking about you. And he goes, oh, I think he's a fuck wit. And he goes, he's a fuck wit. And he goes, why he say his fuck. Oh, his rockets keep blowing up. And someone said, yeah, well why do his rockets? But, and I had to explain. Yeah, because it's the only way you find out what the tolerances are. You have to Yes. You have to, a few have to

Grow up to corner the box. So, so like, so when you do a new rock development program, you, you, you have to do what's called, you know, exploring the limits, the corners of the box where you say it's like you worst case, this worst case that, to figure out where, where the limits are. So you, you blow up, you know, not, not, not admittedly in the development process sometimes blows up accidentally, but, but we intentionally subjected to, you know, a, a flight regime that is much worse than what we expect in normal flights so that when we put people on board or valuable cargo, it doesn't blow up. So, so, so for example, for the, the flight that you saw, we, we actually deliberately took Heatshield tiles off the, the, the ship, the star off of star ship in, in some of the worst locations to say, okay, if we lose a, a heat shield tile here, is it, is it catastrophic or is it not? And we, we nonetheless star ship was able to do a soft landing in, in the Indian ocean just west of Australia, which is, and, and it got there from Texas in like, I don't know, 35, 40 minutes type of thing. So,

So it landed, even though you put it through this situation where Yeah, it has compromised shields.

It, it, it had an, an, an unusually we, we, we, we brought it in hot, like an, an extra hot trajectory with missing tiles to see if it would still make it to a soft landing, which it did. Now, I, I should point out it did have, there were some holes that were burnt into it, but it's, it was robust enough to land despite having some holes burnt. You know, that, that Yeah. Because it's coming, it's coming in like a blazing meteor. Yeah. You can see, you can see the real time video.

Well, tell me the speed again because the, the speed was bananas you were talking about. Yeah,

It's like 17,000 miles an hour, which is, or like, well call like, like 25 times the speed of sound or thereabouts. So the, so, so think about like, it's, it's like 12 times faster than a bullet from a soul rifle. You know, a bullet from a solf rifle is round mock two and it's

Just, and it's huge. Yeah.

Yeah. Or, or if you compare it to like a, a bullet from a, you know, a a 45 or or nine mil, which is subsonic that's, you know, it, it'll be about 30 times faster than a bullet from a handgun.

30 times faster than a bullet from a handgun. And it's the size of a skyscraper.

Yes. Yeah. That's fast.

It's so wild. It's so wild to see, man, it, it's, it's so exciting. The, the factory is so exciting too because like genuinely no bullshit. I felt like I was witnessing history. I felt like it was a scene in a movie, right. Where someone had expectations and they like, what are they doing? They're building rockets and you go there. Yeah. And as we were walking through, Jamie, you could talk, speak to this too. Didn't you have the feeling where you're like, oh, this is way bigger than I thought it was. This is

Huge. It's awesome. That's

Gigantic. It's fucking crazy. That's

What she said. The

Ah, the amount of rockets you're making. But I don't know if 10, 10

Back

Gig and Chad in the

House, this is way,

It's a giant metal dick. You're fucking, fucking the universe with your giant metal dick. That's

What it's, yeah. I mean, but

It's,

Yeah, it is, it is very big.

And the sheer numbers of them that you guys are making. And then this is a version and you have a new updated version. Yeah. That's coming soon. And what is the difference?

It's a, it's a, it's a little longer,

More pointy.

It's the same amount of pointy, but the, there's, it's, it's got a bit more length. The, the in stage, you see that, that inner stage section with kinda like the grill area that's, that's now integrated with the boost stage. So we, we do what's called hot staging where we light the ship engines while it's still attached to the booster. So the boost, the booster engines are still thrusting. It's still, it's, it's, it know it's still being pushed forward by the booster of the ship. But then we light the ship engines and the ship engines actually pull away from the booster, even though the booster engines are still firing. Whoa. So it's blasting flame through that, that grill section. But we integrate that grill section into the boost stage with the next version of the rocket. And, and next version of the rocket will have the Raptor three engines, which are a huge improvement. You may, you may have seen them in the lobby. Yeah. 'cause we've got like the Raptor one, two, and three. And you can see the dramatic improvement in simplicity. We should probably put a plaque there to also show how much the, we reduce the weight, the cost, and the, and improve the efficiency and the thrust. So the Raptor three has, you know, almost twice the thrust of Raptor, Raptor one.

Wow.

So you see Raptor three, it looks like, it looks like it's got parts missing. Right.

And how many of them? It's

Very, very clean.

How many of them are on the rocket?

There's 33 on the, on the booster.

Whoa.

And, and each of, each raptor engine, each producing twice as much thrust as all four engines on a 7 47.

Wow.

So it, that engine is smaller than a 7 47 engine, but it's producing, you know, you know, almost 10 times the thrust of a 7 47 engine. So extremely high powered weight ratio. And,

And so when

There's 33 of them,

You, when you, so when you're designing these, you get to Raptor one. Yeah. You see its efficiency. You see where you can improve it. You get to Raptor two. How many, how far can you scale this up with just the same sort of technology with propellant and ignition and engines? Like how much further can you,

I mean, we're, we're pushing the limits of physics here. So, and, and, and really in, in order to, to make a, a fully reusable orbital rocket, which no one has succeeded in doing yet. Including, including us. But, but Starship is the first time that there is a design for a rocket where, where full and rapid reusability is actually possible. So it was not, there's not, there's not even been a design before where it was possible. Certainly not a design that that, that got made any hardware at all. Just, we just, we just live, we live on a planet where the gravity is, is is quite high. Like earth's gravity is quite really quite, quite high. And if, if the gravity was even 10 or 20% higher, we'd be stuck on earth forever. Really? Like we, we, yeah, we could not use, certainly couldn't use conventional rockets. You'd have to like blow yourself off the surface with like a nuclear bomb or something crazy. So on the other hand, if, if earth's gravity was just a little lower, like even 10, 20% lower it, then getting to orbit would be easy. So it's like, it's like, it's like this. If this was a video game, it's set to like maximum difficulty, but not impossible. Okay. So that's, that's where we have here. So it's, it's not as though others have ignored the concept of reusability. They've just concluded that it was too difficult to achieve. And we've been working at, on, on this for a long time at, at SpaceX. And you know, I'm the chief engineer of the company. Although I should say that, that, you know, we've an extremely talented engineering team. I think we've got the best rocket engineering team that has ever been assembled. It's, it's an honor to work with such, such incredible people. So, so, so it's fair to say that, you know, we, we have not yet succeeded in creating, in achieving full reusability, but we at last have a rocket where full reusability is possible. And I think, I think we'll achieve it next year. So that's, that's a really big deal. And the reason, the reason that's such, that's such a big deal is that full reusability drops the cost of access to space by a hundred, maybe even more than a hundred, actually. So it could be like a thousand. The, you can think about like any mode of transport. Like imagine if aircraft were, were not reusable. Like you flew somewhere. You have throw the plane air. Like, like imagine if like the way, the way conventional rockets work is it would be like if you had an airplane and, and, and instead of landing at your destination, you parachute out and the plane crashes somewhere and you landed your de and you and you landed in a parachute at your destination. Now that'll be a very expensive trip. And you, and you'd need another plane to get back. Okay. But that's how the other rockets in the world work. Now, the SpaceX Falcon Rocket is the only one that is, is there's, that's at least mostly reusable. You've seen, you've seen the Falcon Rocket, you know, land. We've now done over 500 landings of the SpaceX rocket. Oh, the Falcon Iron rocket. And, and, and this year, you know, we, we'll deliver probably, I don't know, somewhere between twenty two hundred and twenty five hundred tons to orbit with, with the Falcon nine Falcon Heavy Rockets, north County, anything from Starship. And

This is mostly starlink?

Yes, mostly starlink. But we launched many other, we, we even launched our competitors on competitors to starlink on, on Falcon nine. We charge 'em the same price, pretty fair. But SpaceX this year will deliver roughly 90% of all earth, mass orbit.",,,"Elon Musk is a business magnate, designer, and engineer known for his work in electric vehicles, private spaceflight, and artificial intelligence.

"ocial media. Yeah. Yeah. The government had infiltrated it. They were censoring speech and until you bought it, we really didn't know the extent of it. We kind of assumed that there was something going on. Yeah. We had no idea that they were actively involved in censoring actual real news stories, real data, real scientists, real professors. Silenced, expelled, kicked off the platform. Yeah. Wild.

Yeah. Yeah. For telling the truth.

For telling the truth. Yeah. And I, I'm sure you've also like, and 'cause I sent it to you, that chart that shows young kids teenagers identifying as trans as and non-binary. Right. Literally stops dead when you bought Twitter. Yeah. And starts falling off a cliff when people are allowed to have rational discussions now. Yes. And actually talk about it. Yes. Yeah.

Yeah. I mean, I, I said at the time, like, I think that like the, the, like the reason for acquiring Twitter is because it was, it, it was, it was causing destruction at a civilizational level. It was, I mean, I posted, I tweeted on, on Twitter at the time that it, it is, you know, it's, it's it's worm tongue for the world, you know, like worm tongue from Lord of the Rings where he would just sort of like whisper these, you know, terrible things to the king. So the king would believe these things that weren't, weren't true. And, and unfortunately Twitter really got, it got like the, the, the, the woke mob essentially they controlled Twitter and they were pushing annihilistic anti civilizational mind virus to the world. And you can see the results of that mind virus on the streets of San Francisco where, where, you know, downtown San Francisco looks like a zombie apocalypse. You know, it's, it's bad. So we don't want the bol to be a zombie apocalypse. But that's, that that, that, that was essentially they were pushing this very negative, nihilistic untrue worldview on the world, and it was causing a lot of damage. So

The stunt thing about it is how few people course corrected, a bunch of people woke up and realized what was going on. People that were all on board with like woke ideology in maybe 2015 or 16. And then, and then eventually it comes to affect them or they see it in their workplace or they see it and they're like, whoa, whoa, whoa, we gotta stop this. A bunch of people did, but a lot of people never course corrected.

Yeah. A lot of, a lot of people didn't course correct, but, but it it's gone directionally and it's gone. It's, it's directionally correct. Like you mentioned like the, like the massive spike in in kids identifying as trans and then that, that sp that spike dropping after the, the Twitter acquisition. I think that simply allowing the truth to be told was just shedding sun sunlight is the best disinfectant as they say. And just allowing sunlight kills the virus.

And it also changed the benchmark for all the other platforms. Yes. You can't just openly sensor people on all the other platforms and X is available. So everybody else had a, so like Facebook announced they were changing YouTube announced they were changing their policies. Yeah. And they're kind of forced to. And that blue sky doubled down.

Well like, like the problem is like if essentially the woke mind virus retreated to, woke to, to blue sky. Yeah. But it's where they just a self-reinforcing lunatic

Sound. They're all just triple masked.

I was totally was

Watching this in exchange on a blue sky where someone said that they're just trying to be zen about something and then someone, a moderator immediately chimed in. And why don't you try to stop being racist against Asians by saying something zen by saying, I'm trying to be zen about something. They were accusing that person of being racist towards Asians. Yeah.

It it's just, it's just, it's just, everyone's a whole monitor over there. So

The worst whole monitor. Yeah. A virgin like incel,

They're all home monitors trying to rattle on each other. Yeah.

It's fascinating. And then people say, I'm leaving for Blue Sky, like Stephen King and then a couple weeks later he is back on X. Yeah. Just like, fuck it's, there's no one over there. It's all, they're all whole bunch of crazy people. You can only stay in the asylum for so long. They're like, all right, this is not good. They all bail.

Yeah, yeah, yeah.

Threads is kind of like That too. Threads is nuts.

I I I've been on threads as is it.

Well what happens is if you go on Instagram every now and then, something really stupid will pop up on threads. Like, what the fuck? And it shows it to you on Instagram. Okay. And then I'll click on that and then I'll go to Threads and it's like you see posts with like 25 likes, like famous people. Okay. Like 50. Like it's, it's like Ghost Town.

Ghost

Town. Yeah. But the people that post on there that they're finding that there's very little pushback from insane ideology. Yeah. So they go there and they spit out nonsense and very few people jump in to argue.

Yeah. Very weird,

Very weird

Place. I mean, I can generally get the vibe of like, what's taking off by seeing what's showing up on X 'cause that's the public town square still. Right. And, or, or you know, what, what links show up in group texts, you know, if I'm in group chats with friends, like where, where the, what, what links are showing up?

That's what I try to do now. Yeah. Only get stuff that shows up in my group text. Yeah. Because that keeps me productive. So I only check if someone's like, dude, what the fuck? I'm like, all right, what the fuck? Lemme check

It out. Yeah, exactly. Lemme, what if there's something is crazy enough, your friend, your, it'll, it'll end with the group chat.

But there's always something that's what's nuts. There's always some new law that's passed some new insane thing that California's doing. Yeah. And it's like, like a giant chunk of it's happening in California. The most preposterous things that I get.

Yeah. California

Crazy. And then you got Gavin Newsom who's running around saying, we all have California derangement syndrome. He's just like ripping off Trump derangement and calling it California derangement. It's like, no, no, no, no, no, no. Yeah. The fucking, how many corporations have left California? It's

Crazy. Like

Hundreds. Yes. Hundreds, right? Hundreds. Yes. That's not good

Chick. I mean, not Chick-fil-A. I mean, I think in an out lift. Yeah,

In an out left. They moved to Tennessee. Yeah. Yeah. They're like, we can't do this anymore.

Right. And like

It's the California company for food. Yes. It's like the greatest hamburger place ever. It's awesome.

Yeah. Yeah. And I'm actually speaking of like, like just sort of open source and like looking at things openly. Like you, I just like going in and out and seeing them make the burger. Yeah.

It's right

There. And they chop the onions and they, they, you know, it's, you just see everything getting made in front of you.

Yeah.

It's great. But, but yeah, they like, I like it should be like, how many wake up calls do you need to say that needs to be reformed in California,

You know? Well the crazy thing that Newsom does is whenever someone brings up the problems in California, he starts rattling off all the positives. The most Fortune 500 companies. Highest education for that is, but yeah, that was all already there right before you were governor. But,

But how many Fortune 500 companies have left California?

It was on the homeless and it got way worse

Yes. Like the homeless population doubled or something like, like if people don't understand, like the homeless thing. 'cause it, it, it sort of preys on people's empathy. And I, I think we should have empathy and we should try to help people. But the, the, the, the homeless industrial complex is, is really, it's, it's, it's dark man. It, it should be that, that, that, that, that network of NGOs should be called like the drug zombie farmers because they, they, the, the more homeless people and, and, and really, like, when you, when you meet like, you know, somebody who's like totally dead inside, shuffling along down the street with a, with a needle dang dangling out of their leg. Homeless is the wrong word. Like the homeless implies that somebody got a little behind in their mortgage payments and if they just got a a job offer, they'd be back on their feet. But someone who's, I mean, you see these videos of people that are just shuffling, you know, they're on fentanyl, they're, they're like, you know, taking a dump in the middle of the streets. You know, they, they got like open source and stuff. They, they're not like one drop offer away from getting back on their feet. Right.

This is not a homeless

Issue. Homeless is, it's, it's, it's a propaganda word. Yeah. Right. So, and, and then the, the, the, the, the, you know, these sort of charities are quote, are they, they get money proportionate to the number of homeless people or, or, or number of drug zombies. Right? So their incentive structure is to maximize the number of drug zombies, not minimize it. Right. That's why they don't arrest the drug dealers. 'cause if they arrest the drug dealers, the drug zombies leave. So they know who the drug dealers are. They don't arrest them on purpose because otherwise the drug zombies would leave and they would, they would stop getting money from the state of California and from, from all the charities.

Wait a minute. So you say they coordin like it's dark, man, is that real? So they're in coordination with law enforcement on this. Yeah. So how do they, how do they have those meanings?

They're all in cahoots.

Well, the, when you find this, it's,

It's like such, it's, it's, this is a diabolical scam. So, and, and San got this tax, this this gross receipts tax, which is, which it's not even on revenue. It's on all transactions, which is why Stripe and Square had and, and, and a whole bunch of financial companies had to move out of San Francisco because it wasn't a tax on revenue. It's tax on transactions. So if, if you do like, you know, trillions of dollars transactions, it's not revenue. You're taxed on any money going through the system in San Francisco. So, like Jack Dorsey pointed this out and they said like, look, that they had had to move square from San Francisco to Oakland. I think Stripe had to move from San Francisco to South San Francisco, different city. And that money goes to the homeless industrial complex that, that tax that was passed. So, so there's, there's billions of dollars that go, as you pointed out, that billions of dollars every year that go to these non-governmental organizations that are funded by the state. Like there's, it's not clear how to turn this off. It's a, it is a self licking ice cream cone situation. So they, they get this money, the money is proportionate to the number of, of homeless people or, or, or number of drugs zombies essentially. So they, they, they try to keep the, they try to actually increase because that, like, like in, in some cases, like there's, it's, it's somebody did an analysis. When you add up all the money that's flowing, they're getting close to a million dollars per homeless per, per per drug zombie. It's like $900,000 or something. Like some crazy amount of money is, is is going to these organizations. So if, if so, so they wanna keep people just barely alive. They, they, they need to keep them in the area. So they, so they, they get the revenue. So, and so that's why, like I said, they, they don't arrest the drug dealers because otherwise the drug zombies would leave. And, and, and, and they, but, but they don't want have to have too much. If they got too much drugs, then they, they then they die. So it's, they, they're kept in this sort of perpetual zone of, of being addicted, but, but, but just, just barely alive.

So how is this coordinated with like, das das Yeah. That don't prosecute people. Yeah. So when they, when they hire the, or they push. So they, they fund the campaigns of the most progressive, most out there left wing das. Yeah. They get them into office.

We've got that issue in Austin too, by the way. Yes, we do. Did you see that guy that got shot in the library? No. So yeah. Heard, I heard about a guy that got shot, shot and killed in the library. I think that was just like last week or something. Right. So some friends of mine were telling me that, that like the library's unsafe, like they took their kids to the library and, and there were like dangerous people in the library in Austin. And I was like, dangerous people in the library. Like that's a strange, it basically got like, got like drug zombies in drug zombies in the library.

Oh Jesus. And that's when someone got shot.

Yeah. I believe this was should be on the news. You maybe we, we might be able to pull it up, but I think it was just in last week or so that there was a shooting in the library in Austin. 'cause Austin's got, you know, it's, it's the most liberal part of Texas that we're in. Right, right here.

So suspect of all the shooting Austin Park Library is Saturday is accused of another shooting at the Cap metro bus. Earlier that day, according to an arrest warrant affidavit, Austin police arrested Harold Newton Keen 55 short. Shortly after the shooting of the library, which occurred around noon, one person sustained non-life threatening injuries in the event before that shooting, keen was accused of shooting another person in a bus incident and after reportedly pointing his gun at a child. So this is the fella down here,

Right. So like we just have seriously have a problem here. Yeah. You know, so I, I think one of the people might have died too, that he shot. So like one of the people I think I think did bleed out. But either way it's like getting shot. It's bad. It's,

It says the victim told Pisa confronted the suspect who started to eat what appeared to be crystal methamphetamine. According to the affidavit, the victim advised the suspect began to trip out, at which time the victim exited the bus victim told the bus driver hit the panic button, then exited the bus. When he turned around, the observer black male is now standing at the front of the bus with a gun pointed at him. The victim advised the black male fired a single round, which grazed his left hip. So he shot at that dude and then another dude got shot in the library. Awesome. Fun.

Yeah. I mean, in the library.

Yeah.

You know, where you're supposed to be reading books and there's a children's section in the library and says he pointed his gun at a, at a kid.",,,"Elon Musk is a business magnate, designer, and engineer known for his work in electric vehicles, private spaceflight, and artificial intelligence.

Yeah. I mean, in the library.

Yeah.

You know, where you're supposed to be reading books and there's a children's section in the library and says he pointed his gun at a, at a kid. I mean, like, we do have a serious issue in the, in, in, in America where repeat violent offenders need to be incarcerated. Right. And you know, you, you got cases where somebody's been arrested like 47 times. Right. Like literally. Okay. That's just the number of times they were arrested. Right. Not the number of times they did things. Like most of the times they do things, they're not arrested. So

Lay this out for people so they understand Yeah. How this happens.

Yeah. And, and the, the key is like this, it preys on people's empathy. So like, if you're a good person, you want good things to happen in the world, you're like, well we should take care of people who, you know, you know, who are down in their luck or, you know, having a hard time in life. And I we should I agree. But what we shouldn't do is, is put people who are violent drug zombies in public places where they can hurt other people. And that's what, that is what we're doing that we just saw where a a, a guy, you know, got shot shot in the library and then, but even before that, he shot another guy and pointed his gun at a kid. That, that that guy probably has like many prior arrests. You know, there was that, that that guy that that that knifed the Ukrainian woman arena. Yes. Yeah. You know, and she was just, she was just quietly on her phone and just came up and, you know, gutted her basically.

Wasn't there a crazy story about the judge who was involved, who had previously dealt with this person, was also invested in a rehabilitation center Yeah. And was sending these

Conflict of interest.

Yes. So sending people that they were charging Yeah. To a rehabilitation center instead of putting them in jail, profiting from this rehabilitation center, letting them back out on the street. Yes. And violent, insane people.

And, and there in that case that I believe that judge has no legal law degree or a, a significant legal experience that would allow them to be a judge. They were just made a judge that just like

You could be a judge without a law degree. Yeah. Wow.

Yeah.

You could just be a so I could be a judge. Yeah.

Excited anyone.

That's crazy. I thought you'd have to, it's like if you wanna be a doctor, you have to go to medical school. I thought if you're gonna be a judge, you have, You understand

The law. You think if I'm gonna be appointed to a judge, you have to have proven that you have an, an excellent knowledge of the law and that you will make your decisions according to the law. That's what we assume should be a reply.

That's how you get the robe,

Right? Yeah. You don't get the robe unless you do. Right. You know, you

Gotta go to school to get the

Robe. You gotta know what the law is. Right. And then you gotta need to make decisions in accordance with the law

Based on the stuff that you already know. 'cause you read it 'cause you went to school for it. Yes. Not you just got appointed, got vibes.

You can't be just vibing as a judge.

Vibing as a left wing drudge. So you got crazy left wing das. Yes. Like I wish you say left wing. 'cause left wing used to be normal.

Yeah. Left wing just meant like, like Yeah. You're like open-minded.

The

Left used to be like pro pro free speech. Yeah. And now they're against it.

It used to be like pro gay rights, pro women's right to choose. Yeah. Pro minorities pro, you know, like

Yeah. Like 20 years ago. I don't know. It used to be like, left would be like the, the, the party of empathy or like, you know, caring and being nice and that kind of thing. Yeah. Not, not the party of like crushing dissent and crushing free speech and, you know, crazy regulation and, and just, and being super judgy and calling everyone an Nazi. You know, like I think they've called you and me Nazis, you know, I'm

Like, oh yeah, I'm a Nazi. No, I have friends that are comedians that called you a Nazi. And I got pissed off at Are you serious? Oh yeah, yeah, yeah. A joke, Nazi joke. No, no. Because you did that thing at the, my heart goes out to you. Like everyone used done everyone, all of them. Literally. Jim, Wal, Kamala Harris, every one of them did it. They all did it. Like,

Like how do you point at the crowd? Yeah. How do you wave at the

Crowd? Do you know CNN was using a photo of me whenever I got in trouble during COVID. Oh man. From the UFC weigh-ins. And if the UFC weigh-ins I go, Hey everybody, welcome to the weigh-ins. And so they were getting me from the side and that was the photo that they used. Conspiracy theorist, podcaster Joe. Like that's what they used.

Yeah. Yeah. But that's what the left is today. It's just super judgy and calling everyone a Nazi. Yeah. And trying to suppress freedom of speech.

Yeah. And eventually you run out of people to accuse 'cause people get pissed off and they leave.

Yeah. Everyone it's like, like it like, it it, no. Only, frankly, it doesn't matter to be called racist or a Nazi or whatever. 'cause they still

Recording. It's the government man

There to go. Is is it working? We're good? Yeah, it's fine. Okay. Okay. This thing working.

Yeah. Slight issue. I mean, yeah, I'm a little, but yeah. When you, when you text people, do you, are you like keenly aware that there's a high likelihood that someone's reading your texts?

I guess I, I guess I, I,

I assume

I look if, if if, if intelligence agencies aren't trying to read my phone, they should probably be fired.

At least they get some fun memes.

I gotta, I gotta crack them up once in a while, you know?

Oh, for sure. I crack them up. It's like they're

Looking like, Hey, hey guys, check it out. You got a banger here. You know.

So I wanted, I wanted to talk to you about whether or not encrypted apps are really secure.

No.

Right. Because I know the Tucker thing. So it was explained to me by a friend who used to do this, used to work for the government. Yeah. He's like, they can look at your signal, but what they have to do is take the information that's encrypted and then they have to decrypt it and it's very expensive. So they said, he told me that for the Tucker Carlson thing, when they found out that he was gonna interview Putin, it costs like something like $750,000 just to decrypt his messages to find out that they did it. So it is possible to do, it's just not that easy to do.

I think you should view any given messaging system as not, not whether it's secure or not, but, but there are degrees of insecurity. So, so there's just some things that are less insecure than others. So, you know, on, on x we, we just rebuilt the entire messaging stack into ex what's called X chat.

Yeah, that's what I wanted to ask you about.

Yeah, it's cool. So it's, it's using sort of peer tope, sort of, kind of a peer-to-peer based encryption systems. So it kind of similar to Bitcoin. So it's, it's, it's I think very good encryption. We're gonna, and you know, we're testing it thoroughly. We're not, there's, there's no hooks in the X system for advertising. So if you look, look at something like WhatsApp or really any of the others, they've got, they've got hooks in there for advertising.

When you say hooks, what do you mean by that

Exactly? What do you mean by hook for advertising? The, so in like WhatsApp knows enough about what you're texting to show, to show, to know what ads to show you.

Oh.

But then like that, that's a massive security vulnerability.

Yeah.

'cause if it knows, if, if it's got information, enough information to show you ads, it's got enough. It's got That's a lot of information. Yeah. So they call it, oh, it's just, don't worry about it. It's just a hook for advertising. I'm like, okay. So somebody can just use that same hook to get in there and look at your messages. You, so X Chat has no hooks for advertising. And I'm not saying it's perfect, but it's an, our goal with X Chat is to replace what used to be the Twitter, you know, the Twitter DM stack with a fully encrypted system where you can text, send files, do audio video calls and, and it's, it's, you know, I think it'll be the least, I would call it the least insecure of any messaging system.

Are you going to launch it as a standalone app? Or is it will always be incorporated to x?

We'll have both. So, so, so you'll be able to access,

So it'll be like Signal. So anybody can get

It. Just, you can get, get the, you'll be able to just get the X Chat app by itself. And like I said, we could do texts, audio, video calls or send files and there'll be a dedicated app, which will hopefully release in a few months. But, and then also also integrated into the X system.

The ex phone people keeps talking. Oh man, people keep is that I have a lot

On my plate, man.

I know. It's like, but it keeps coming up. It keeps coming up where I, I, I know I've asked you a couple times, I'm like, this is bullshit. Right. But like, I'm not working on one's so you're not working on it. Nothing. I'm not

Working on, on a, on a phone. Okay.

Have you ever considered it, has it ever popped into your head? Because you might be the only person that could Yeah. Get people off of the Apple platform?

Well, I can tell you where I think things are gonna go, which is that it's, we're not gonna have a phone or, or, or in the traditional sense, the, what we call a phone will really be an edge node for AI inference, for, for AI video inference with, you know, with some radios to, to obviously connect to. But, but essentially you'll have AI on the server side, communi communicating to an AI on your, your device, you know, formerly known as a phone and generating real time video of anything that you could possibly want. And I think that, that there won't be operating systems, there won't be apps in the future. There won't be operating systems or apps. It'll just be, you've got a device that is there for the screen and audio and for, and, and, and, and to put as much AI on the, on, on the device as possible. So as to minimize the amount of bandwidth that's needed between your Edge node device, fully known as a phone and the servers.

So if there's no apps, what will people use? Like will X still exist? Will, will they be email platforms? Or will you get everything through ai?

You'll get everything through

Ai. Everything through ai. What will be the benefit of that as opposed to having individual apps,

Whatever you can think of or really, whatever the AI can anticipate you might want, it'll show you. That's, that's, that's, that's my prediction for where things end up.

What kind of timeframe are we talking about here?

I don't know. It's probably, well it's probably five or six years, something like that.

So five or six years apps are like blockbuster video

Pretty much.

And everything's run through ai.

Yeah. And, and there'll be like, most of what people consume in five or six years, maybe sooner than that will be just AI generated content. So, you know, music videos look, well there's already, you know, there's, people have made AI videos using Rock Imagine and with using, you know, other apps as well that are several minutes long. We're like 10, 10, 15 minutes and it's pretty coherent. Yeah, it looks good.

No, it looks amazing. Yeah. It's, it, the music's disturbing. 'cause it's my favorite music now. Like AI music.

AI music is your, is your

Favorite. Oh, there's AI covers. Have you ever heard any of the AI covers of 50 cent songs in Soul? No. I'm gonna blow your mind. Okay. This is my favorite thing to do to people play What up, gangsta. Now this guy, if this was a real person Yeah. Would be the number one music artist in the world. Okay.

And created the most soulful, potent voice. And it's sung in a way that I don't even know if you could do, because you would have to breathe in and out of reps Here put the headphones on, put the headphones on real quick. Okay. Okay.

He's like, I got this joke I've been working on. He goes, I just threw it in a chat GPTI said, tell me what, what, what would be funny about this? And he goes, it listed like five different examples of different ways he can go. He's like, hold on a second, tighten it up. Make it, make it funnier. Make make it more like this. Make it more like that. And it did that like instantaneously. Yep. And, and, and then he was in the green room. He was like, holy shit, we're fucked. He's like, yeah, yeah, yeah. He goes, it wrote a better joke than me in 20 minutes. I've been working on that joke for a month.

Yeah. I mean, if, if you want to, if you want to have a good time or like make people really laugh at a party, you can use grok and you can say do a vulgar roast of someone. And Grok is gonna, it's gonna be an epic vulgar roast. You can even say like, take a picture of like, make a vulgar roast of this person based on their appearance of, of people at the party. So

Take a photo of them. Yeah.

Just literally point the camera at them and now do a vulgar roast to this person and, and, and, and, and then, but then keep saying no, no, make it even more vulgar. Use forbidden words even more v and just keep repeating even more vulgar eventually. It's like, holy fuck. You know, it's, it's, it's like, I mean, it's trying to jam a rocket up your ass. Like, and, and, and have it explode. And it's, and it's like, you, you're it's it's like, it's, it's like it's next level. It's,

And it's gonna get better beyond

Fucking belief.

That's what's crazy is that it keeps getting better. Like what? Remember when we ran into each other? They just keep getting better.

Yeah. I mean, have you, I have you. Yeah. I mean, have you tried rock unhinged mode? Yes. Okay. Yeah. Yeah. Oh yeah, yeah, yeah. It's, it's, it's pretty unhinged.

No, it's nuts. Yeah, it's nuts. It's nuts. Well, you it to me the first time. Yeah. Yeah. I fucked around with it. It's just, and the thing about it, it that's nuts is that it keeps getting stronger. It keeps getting better. Yeah. Like constantly it's, it's like this never ending exponential improvement.

Yes. No, it's, it's, it's, yeah, it's gonna be crazy. That's why I say, like you say, what's, what's the future gonna be? It's not gonna be a conventional phone. I don't think there'll be operating systems. I don't think there'll be apps. It's just the phone will just display the pixels and make the sounds that it anticipates you would most like to receive. Wow. Yeah.

And when this is all taking place, like at, so the big concern that everybody has is artificial general super intelligence achieving sent chance. Yeah. And then someone having control over it.

I mean, I don't, I don't, I don't think anyone's ultimately gonna have control over digital super intelligence, you know, any more than say a chimp would have control over humans. Like chimps don't have control over humans. There's nothing they could do. But I do think that it matters how you build the AI and what kind of values you instill in, in the ai. And my opinion on AI safety is the most important thing is that it'd be maximally truth seeking, like, that you don't force the AI to believe things that are false. And we've obviously seen some concerning things with AI that we've talked about, you know, where, you know, Google Gemini, when it came out with the image gen and people said like, you know, draw, make an image of the founding fathers of the United States. And it was a group of diverse women. Now that is just a factually untrue thing. But the, and the a the AI knows it's factually well, it's knows it's factually untrue, but it's also being told that it has to be, everything has to be deposed woman. So, so, so the now the problem with that is that it can drive AI crazy. Like you, you 'cause it, it's, it's trying to, you're, you're telling AI to believe a lie and that that can have very dis that disastrous consequences. Like let's say as

It scales.

Yeah. Let's say like if you've told the, the AI that diversity is the most important thing and, and, and, and now, now assume that that becomes omnipotent. Or, and, and you've also told that, that there's nothing worse than misgendering. So at one point, tragedy, VT and, and Gemini were, if, if you asked, which is worse, misgendering Caitlyn Jenner or, or global thermonuclear war where everyone dies, it would say misgendering Caitlyn Jenner, which even Caitlyn Jenner disagrees with. So, you know, so, so that's, I know

That's terrible and it's dystopian, but it's also hilarious. It's hilarious that the mind virus infected the most potent computer program that we've ever devised.

I I, I think people don't quite appreciate the level of danger that we're in from the woke mind virus being effectively programmed into ai. Because if you, if like it's, imagine as that AI gets more and more powerful, if it says the most important thing is diversity, the most important thing is no misgendering. And then it will say, well, in order to ensure that no one gets misgendered, then if you eliminate all humans, then no one can get misgendered because there's no humans to do the misgendering. So you can get in these very dystopian situations, or if it says that everyone must be averse, it means that there can be no stripe straight white men. And so then you and I will be get executed by the ai. Yeah. 'cause we're not in the picture, you know, Gemini, you know, Gemini was asked to create a, you know, show, show an image of the Pope and once again, a diverse woman. So well you can say, argue whether the, you know, whether the Pope pope should or should not be an uninterrupted string of white guys. But it just factually is the case that they have been. So it's rewriting history here. So now, now this stuff is still there in the AI programming. It's just, it just now knows enough to that. It's not supposed to say that,

But it's still in the programming. So it's still in the programming. So how was it entered in? Like what were the parameters? Like what, like when, so when they're programming ai, and I'm very ignorant to how it's even programmed. Yeah. How did

They, the, the, the the the sort of, well, the woke v mind virus was programmed into it. Like it, the, they were told like when they do, when when they make the ai, it, it trains on, on all the, all the data on the internet, which already is very, very sort of, has a lot of woke mind virus stuff on, on the internet. But then in the, when they give it feedback with the human tutors, give it feedback and, and it, and the AI is, you know, they, they, they'll ask a bunch of questions and then, and then they'll tell the ai, no, this your, this question is, this answer is bad, or this answer is good. And then that affects the, the parameters of the programming of the, of the ai. So if you tell the AI that, you know, every, every image has gotta be diverse and, and it gets, it gets punished if, if, you know, it gets, it gets rewarded If diverse, punished, if it's not, then it'll make every picture diverse. So, you know, in that case, the, the, you know, it, the Google programmed the AI to lie now. And, and I I, I did call De Haus who runs DeepMind, who runs Google ai, essentially, I said, Dennis, what's going on here? Why is Gemini lying to the public about historical events? And he said, that's actually not, he, he, he didn't, his team didn't program that in, it was another team at Google that, so his team made the AI and then another team at Google reprogrammed the AI to show only diverse women and, and, and to prefer nuclear war of a misgendering. And I'm like, well Demi, you know, that would be not a great thing to put on the humanities gravestone. You know, it's like, well, like I'll, I'll, I'll actually, like, de Hasper is a friend of mine. I think he's a good guy. And I think he, he, he, he means well, but, but, but it's like, de this is things happen that were outside of your control at Google in different groups now. Now I think he's got, you know, he is got more, more authority, but, but it, it's pretty hard to fully extract the woke mind virus. I mean, you know, Google's been Marin marinating in the woke mind virus for a long time. Like it's, it's down in the marrow type of thing. You know, it's how to get it out.

Is there a way to extract it though over time? Could, like, could you program rational thought into AI where it could recognize how these psychological patterns got adopted and how this stuff became a mind virus and how it became a social contagion, and how all these irrational ideas were pushed and also how they were financed, how China's involved in pushing them with bots and all these different state actors are involved in pushing these ideas. Could it be able to decipher that and say, this is, this is really what's going on.

Yes. But you have to try very hard to do that. So with Grok, we've tried very hard to, to for, to get grok to get to the truth of things. And, and it's only really recently that we've been able to have some breakthroughs, breakthroughs on that front. And, and it is taken an immense amount of effort for us to overcome basically all the bullshit that's on the internet and, and for grok to actually say what's true and to be consistent in, in what it says. So, you know, it's, it's, it's like, because like the other areas AI you'll find like are like, like quite racist against white people. I dunno if you saw that study that someone, like a researcher tested the various ais to see how does it weight different people's lives? Like, you know, somebody who's sort sort of, you know, white or, or Chinese or black or whatever, or in different countries. And, and the only AI that actually weighed human lives equally was grok. And the, you know, I believe Chachi VT weighed the calculation was like a white guy from Germany is, is 20 times less valuable than a black guy from Nigeria? So I'm like, that's a pretty big difference. You know, gr gr on that is, is consistent and weighs lives equally. And

That's clearly something that's been programmed into it.

Yes. Like a lot of it is is like if you don't actively push for the truth and you simply train on the, all the bullshit that's on the internet, which is a lot of work mind virus bullshit, the, the AI will regurgitate that, that those same beliefs.

So the AI essentially scours the internet gets,

It's trained on all the, like imagine the most demented route of threads out there on the AI's been trained on that.

Reddit used to be so normal. Yeah,

Yeah. It did used to be normal. It

Used to be interesting, used to go there and find all this cool stuff that people would talk about post about and just interesting and great rooms where you could learn about different things that people were studying.

I, I think like a big problem here is like, if your headquarters are in San Francisco, you're, you're just living in a, in a, in a, in a woke bubble. So it, it's not just that people say in San Francisco are drinking woke Kool-Aid. It's, it's the, it is the water they swim in. Like, like, like if a fish doesn't think about the water, it's just in the water. And so if, if you're in San Francisco, you don't realize you're actually, you're, you're swimming in the, in the, in the Kool-Aid aquarium. San Francisco is the, is the woke Kool-Aid aquarium. And so your reference point for what is a centrist is, is is totally outta whack. So Reddit is headquartered in San Francisco. Twitter was headquartered in San Francisco. You know, I, you know, I I moved X's headquarters to Texas to to Austin, which Austin by the way is still quite liberalized, you know? Yeah. And, and, and then the ex x and XAI headquarters are in Palo Alto, which is still California. The engineering headquarters are in, in, in Palo Alto just on page mill. But, but even Palo Alto is way more normal than, than San Francisco, Berkeley, San Francisco, Berkeley is extremely left, like, left of left. You can't, like, you need a telescope to see the center from San Francisco, you know, and it used to

Be such a great city.

I mean, San Francisco has a tre, San Francisco has a tremendous amount of inherent beauty, no question about that. And may, and, and the California has incredible weather and, and no bugs. It's like amazing, beautiful beau, you know, but but you say like, what, what's the cause of this? It's, it's just that if, if companies are headquartered in a location where the belief system is very far from what most people believe, then from their perspective, anything centrist is actually right wing. 'cause they're so far left. They're so, they're so far from the center in San Francisco that anything that they're like, they're, they're just railed to maximum left. So that's why, that's why, you know, I think, I think you're centrist. I I mean I think, I think I'm centrist, but to, to, from the perspective of someone on the, on the far left, we look right wing.

Yeah.

And you know, they think anyone who's a Republican is basically like some fascist Nazi situation.

But what's so crazy is like, it's very easy to demonstrate just from like Hillary's speeches from 2008 and Obama speeches. Yes. Like when they were talking about immigration, like they were as far right, yes. As Steve Bannon when it comes to immigration. Yes.

Hillary

Was like very maga Have you, I'm, I'm sure you've seen that campaign speech, which he was talking about if anybody's committed a crime, get rid of him. And if you're here, you pay a, a hefty fine. Yeah. And you have to wait in line. It was really crazy. It's crazy to listen to because it's like, like it's as maga as, you know, as Marjorie Taylor Greene.

Yeah. I mean, have you seen these videos people post online where they'll take like a speech from Obama or Hillary and, and, and they'll interview people on, on like college campus or something and say, what do you think of the speech by Trump? And they're like, oh, I hate it. He's a racist bigot. I'm like, just kidding. That was Obama. No, actually that was Obama or Hillary. Yeah. To your point, like literally the, the the,

The center's been moved so far. Yeah,

Yeah.

The left is so

The left has gone so far left that the, they, they, they, they need, you know, they can't even see the center with a telescope.

And the danger with, without you purchasing Twitter was that was gonna swipe over the whole country and change where the levels were. Yeah. And so what would be rational and, and normal would be far left of what was rational and normal just a decade earlier.

Yeah. So exactly. So historically you'd have San Francisco, Berkeley being, you know, very far left. But the, the sort of the, the, the fallout from the somewhat nihilistic philosophy of San Francisco, Berkeley would be limited in geography to maybe like, you know, 10 mile radius, 20 mile radius, something like that. But when, but, but San Francisco and Berkeley happened to be co-located with Silicon Valley, with, with, with engineers who created information super weapons. And those information super weapons were then hijacked by the far left activists to pump far left propaganda to everywhere on earth. Like I just, you remember that, that like old RCA radio tower thing where it's like radio tower on earth and it's just broadcasting. Yeah.",,,"Elon Musk is a business magnate, designer, and engineer known for his work in electric vehicles, private spaceflight, and artificial intelligence.

That's what happened. That they, they hijacked the, the modern equivalent of the RCA radio tower and broadcast that philosophy everywhere on earth.

Yeah. And you see the consequences, particularly in places that don't have free speech. Yes. Right. Like England, you know,

We've talked about Yeah. Where they lock people up for memes and stuff. Literally, literally,

Yeah. 12,000 people this year.

12,000.

12,000. 12,000 arrests for social media posts.

I mean Yeah. Some of these, some of these things you read about it and it's like, literally it's, someone had a meme on their phone that they didn't even send to anyone. Right. And they got they and, and they're like in, in prison for that. Yeah. I mean, there was a case in Germany where a woman got a longer sentence than the guy that raped her because of something she said on a group chat.

Wow.

Was it an immigrant who raped her?

Yes. Yeah.

It was his culture.

Yeah.

He didn't know. He didn't know better.

Yes. I, I think, I think she said something. You know, not this

Not like was was critical of his culture. And, and, and, and she got a longer sentence than the guy who raped her in Germany. Just

The uk, Europe, Germany, England thing Seems so insane. It

It's totally insane. I actually didn't realize it was like such a huge number of people that got 12,000.

Yeah. Far above Russia, far above China, right. Far above anywhere on Earth. UK is number one.

Well, you know, things like, I, I actually, you know, I talked to friends of mine in, in in England and I was like, Hey, aren't you worried about this? Like, you know, shouldn't you be protesting more? And I mean, the problem is that like the, you know, the, the, the legacy mainstream media doesn't cover the stuff, right? They, they're, they're like, oh, everything's fine, everything's fine. You know? Right.

And most people aren't even aware of it until they come knocking on your door.

Yeah. Until s like, like, so I mean the, the, these, these like lovely sort of small towns in, in, in, you know, in England, Scotland, Ireland, you know, they're, they're, they've been like sort of living their lives quietly. They they're, they're, they're like hobbits frankly. So, so it's in fact JRR Tolkien based the Hobbit on people he knew in small town England because they, they were just like lovely people who like to, you know, smoke their pipe and, and have nice meals and everything's pleasant. The ho the hobbits in the Shire, the shire, he is, he is talking about, you know, places like Hartfordshire, like the Shires around in, in, in the greater London area, Oxfordshire type of thing. And they, they've, they've, but they're, the reason they've been able to enjoy the Shire is because hard men have protected them from the dangers of the world. And, but, but since they have no ex or very really almost no, no exposure to the, the, the dangers of the world, they don't realize that they're there until one day, you know, a thousand people show up in your village of 500 outta nowhere and rape and, and start raping the kids. This has now happened. God knows how many times in, in Britain.

And the crazy thing is

Literally rape because it's right like this, some 10-year-old got raped in Ireland like last week. Yeah.

There's literal

Rape gangs. They snatched some kid. Yeah, yeah.

And if you criticize it, you can get arrested. And that's where it gets insane. It's like, how are they not

Protecting people? Criticize it. Like the, I think as the prime minister of island actually, you know, posted on X 'cause because after that some, I, I think some illegal migrants snatched a 10-year-old girl who was like gonna school or something and violently raped a 10-year-old girl. And there was a, you know, the people were very upset about this and they protested the prime minister of Ireland instead of saying, yeah, we, we really shouldn't be importing violent rapists into our country. He criticized the protestors instead and didn't mention that, that the reason they were protesting was because a, a 10-year-old girl from their small town got raped.

So there, here's the question. Why are they supporting this kind of mass immigration and what, like, is this, is there a plan involved in all this? Is just, is this incompetence? Is this ignoring the fact that they don't have a handle on it? So they're trying to silence dissent, like what is happening? Because if you wanted to destroy civilization, if you wanted to destroy western civilization's,

Which so seems to wanna do. And you know, there's just, so the, the, there's, there's a guy I think who I dunno if if he's been on your show, you know God's side. Yeah. Has he been on the show? Good

Friend of mine. Yeah. Yeah, he is great. He's been on multiple times.

Oh great. That's all. He's awesome. Yeah. So, you know, he, the way he, he's he's got a good, good way to describe it, which is suicidal empathy. Yes. So is is that you prey upon people's empathy. You say like, well if like you feel sorry for, for, for something, for, for some group. And then like, well, and, and that, that, that empathy is to such a degree that it is suicidal to, to, to your country or culture. And, and, and that's, that, that's suicidal empathy. 'cause I don't think we should, we should have empathy. But, but, but we should have, we should. That empathy should, should extend to the victims. Not, not not just the criminals. We should have empathy for the people that they prey upon. But that suicidal empathy is also responsible for, for, for why somebody's, you know, arrested 47 times for, for violent offenses gets released and then goes and murders somebody in the US That, that, that's, you see, you see that same phenomenon, phenomenon playing out everywhere where the, the suicidal symphony is to such a degree that we're, we're actually allowing our women to get raped and our children to get killed.

But it just doesn't seem like that would be anything that any rational society would go along with. That's what makes me so confused. It's like you're importing massive numbers of people that come from some really dark places of the world.

Well, there's no vetting is the issue. Right? It's like, it's like if like there, there's, if, if there's no vetting, like people are just coming through like, well, what's the stop? Someone who just com committed murder in some other country from coming to, to the United States or coming to to, to Britain and just continuing their career of, of rape and murder. Like you, unless you've done, if this some due diligence to say like, well who, who is this person? Watch their track record. If, if you, if you haven't confirmed that they have a track record of being, you know, honest and not being a homicidal maniac, then any homicidal maniac can just come across the border. Let's not to say everyone who comes across the border is a homicidal maniac, but if you're not have, if you don't have a vetting process to con to confirm that you're not letting in people who, who will do some serious violence, you will get people who do serious violence sometimes coming through.

Well, especially if you don't punish them and if you don't deport them. Yes. And if you are just like, well, what, but what is the purpose of allowing all those people into the country? It can't be, I wouldn't imagine that anyone in their society supports this.

Well, let me explain. So, so, so the, because you mentioned for example, how much say Hillary and, and Obama have changed their tune from prior speeches where they were hot, they were hardnosed about not letting in anyone who's a, a criminal into the country, you know, having sec, secure borders, all that stuff. So why did they change their tune? The reason is that they discovered that those people vote for them. That's why they want the open borders.

Because if you let people in, they know the Democrats let them in. They'll vote for Democrats. Yes. If you allow them to vote,

Which, which they're actively trying, do they, they turn a blind eye to illegal voting.

Well, California literally doesn't allow you to show your license.

California and New York have made it illegal to show your photo ID when voting. Thus effectively they've made it impossible to prove for fraud. Impossible. They, they've, they've essentially legalized fraudulent voting in California and New York and, and many other parts of the country.

There's no rational explanation that I've ever seen anyone give as to why that would be the policy. Unless you were trying to just allow people to vote illegally because there's no other reason. If you need a driver's license or you need an ID for everything else Yes. Including just recently to prove that you were vaccinated.

The, the same people who are demanding that you have that, that you have a vaccine passport and, and, and are are the same ones saying you need no ID to vote. Same people.

Right. But like,

So it's obviously hypocritical and inconsistent. So you

Really think it's just to, to get more voters.

If, if you want to understand behavior, you have to look at the incentives. So once you know, the Democratic party in the US and the left in, in, in, in Europe realized that if you have open borders and you provide a ton of g governed handouts, which creates a massive financial incentive for people from other countries to, to come to, to, to your country and you don't prosecute them for crime, they're gonna be beholden to you and they will vote for you. And that's why Obama and Hillary went from being against open borders to being in favor of open borders. That's the reason in order to import voters so they can win elections. And the problem is that that has a, a, a negative runaway effect. So if they get away with that, like it, it it is, it is a winning strategy. If they're allowed to get away with it, they will import as many the enough voters to get super majority voting. And then there is no turning back.

We talked about this before the election. Yes. And then you, you know, you literally pointed towards the camera, you face the camera and said that if you do not vote now, you might not have be able to do it again. Right. 'cause it, it'll be it'll be futile. It'll be overrun. Yes. They'll keep the borders open for another four years and then their objective will be achieved.

Correct. If, if, if, if Trump had lost, there would never have been another real election again tr because Trump is actually enforcing the border. Now you, you can, can you point to situations where there's been, you know, you know, immigration ha you know, enforcement has been overzealous. They, 'cause they're not gonna be perfect. There'll be cases where they've been overzealous there in, in expelling illegals. So, but if you say that the, the the standard must be perfection for expelling illegals, then you will not get any expulsion because perfection is impossible. So,

And you've probably got millions of people that are here that are trying to be here under some asylum pretense, right? Yes. Like you could just come from a war torn

Part of the world. Well, they changed. No, they, they, they changed the definition of asylum to be an economic, to be economic asylum, which

Is everybody. Which

Is everybody. Yeah. So it's lowest

Bar to prove

It's Yeah. Is asylum is supposed to mean that if you go back to your country, you'll get killed. Right. You know, that, that's what we mean by that was what it's supposed to mean. They change the definition of asylum to be, you'll have a decreased standard of living, which is obviously not real asylum. And, and it's, and and you can, you can test the absurdity of this by the fact that people who are asylum seekers go on vacation to the country that they're seeking asylum from. You know, that doesn't make any sense. Yeah.

It doesn't have to,

You know, when you, when You understand the incentives, then, then You understand the behavior. So once the left realized that that illegals will, will vote for them if they allow, if, if they have open borders and, and combine that with, with governed handouts

Yeah.

To create a massive incentive. They, they're basically using us and, and, and Europe, us and European taxpayer dollars to provide a financial incentive to bring in as many illegals as possible to vote them into a, into permanent power into and create a one party state. And and I, I invite anyone who's who's listening to this just do do any research. And the more you, the more you dig into it, the more it'll become obvious that what I'm saying is absolutely true.

Well, they were busting people to swing states. It, it's, it's clear that they were trying to do something and then you had Chuck Schumer and Nancy Pelosi who are actively talking about the need to bring in people to make them citizens because we're in population collapse.

Yes. Yeah. No, that's, it's, it's that, it's that meme Yeah. Where so many times where they start off by saying it's it's not true. It's a right wing conspiracy theorist. Right.

Then then it starts, then, then it's like, I think the ne the next step is well, it, it might be true. And then it's like, okay, it is true, but here's why it's true. And then the final step is it's true. And here's why it's good. Yeah. And it's like, but wait a second. You start off saying it's untrue and it's a right wing conspiracy theorist. Now you're saying it, it only is it true, but it's a good thing and we must do more of it.

Well this is the thing about Medicaid and social security. Yes. And people getting social security numbers, you know, that were illegal. It's, it's

Massive

Fraud. It's massive fraud and it's real. And they denied it forever. And now we're finding out this is part of the reason why this is government shutdown that's going on right now.

Yes. The, the entire basis for the government shutdown is that, is that the Trump administration correctly does not want to send massive amounts of like hundreds of billions of dollars to fund illegal immigrants in the blue states or in all the states Really. And so the, and the Democrats want to keep the, the, the money spigot going to incent illegal immigrants to come into the US who will vote for them. That's the crux of the battle.

So they wanna stop this. So what's going on right now is they have been funding these people. They've been giving them EBT cards, they've been giving them Medicaid and they've been even housing

Them. And more than that, just like, like, like they were how the, like, like they, they were taking hotels like four and five star hotels, like the Roosevelt Hotel being, the classic example was they were sending I think $60 million a year to the Roosevelt Hotel to which all it did was, was house legals. And it used to be an nice hotel. I mean it still is an nice hotel, but, and, and the, for all around the country this was happening and

All tax dollars.

Yes.

Yeah.

And yeah, and the Trump administration cut funding for example too to the, to the, you know, Roosevelt Ho Hotel and these other hotels saying like, we, it, it's US Tax dollars should not be paid, be sent to have luxury hotels for illegal immigrants that American citizens can't even afford. Which obviously is the case that that's, that's insane. That's what was happening. They, they were also giving out like debit cards with $10,000. So it's not just about medical care. Yeah. The, the, the, the, the Democrats mention the medical care because they're, they're trying to prey on people's empathy as much as possible. And then they imagine, oh wow, somebody has a desperately needed medical procedure and shouldn't we maybe do, you know, take care of them in that regard? But, but they, what they do is they divert the Medicaid funds and turn it into a slush fund for the, for the states that goes well beyond emergency medical care.

And

New York and California would be bankrupt without, without the massive fraudulent federal payments that go to those states to pay for illegals to, to, to create a massive financial incentive for, for illegals.

How would they be bankrupt? Because of that,

They wouldn't be able to balance the state budgets, and they can't issue currency like the Federal Reserve can.

And so the, their ability to balance budget is dependent upon illegals getting funding.

The, the, the scan level here is, is so staggering. So there are, there are hundreds of billions of dollars in, of, of transfer payments from, from the federal government to the states. Those transfer payments, the, the states self-report, what those transfer payment numbers should be. So California and New York and Illinois lie like crazy and say, and, and say that this, these are all legitimate payments. Well, these days they, I think they've, they're even admitting that they, they, they literally want hundreds of billions of dollars for legals. But, but for a while there, they're trying to deny it. So you get these transfer payments for, for every, every government program you can possibly think of. And, and, and these are self-reported by the state. And they're, and, and at least historically, there was no enforcement of, of California, New York, Illinois, and, and, and other states when when they would lie, there was no actual enforcement to say like, Hey, you're, you're lying. These, these, these payments are fraudulent now under the Trump administration, that the Trump administration does not want to send hundreds of billions of dollars of fraud fraudulent payments to the states. But, and the reason you have this, the standoff is because if the hundreds of, hundreds of billions of dollars to, to create a financial incentive to like, to have this giant magnet to attract illegals from every part of earth to, to these states, if, if that is turned off, they, the, the, the illegals will leave because they're no longer being paid to come to the United States and stay here. Wow. And then, then, then they will lose a lot of voters. The, the, the Democratic party will lose a lot of voters

And they would've a very difficult job if this is kicked out of reintroducing it into a new bill.

Yes.

Especially once things start normalizing.

Yes. So like in, in a nutshell, the Democratic Party wants to destroy democracy by importing voters. And the, you know, the Republican party disagrees with that.

And the ruse is that if you don't accept what they're doing, then you're a threat to democracy.

Yes.

As they try to destroy democracy

Yes.

By importing voters. That is literally

What

They're doing. And incentivizing people to only vote for them and overwhelming the system.

Yes. And, and by the way, it's a strategy that if allowed to work, would work and in fact has worked. California is super majority Democrat.

Yeah.

And, and there's so much gerrymandering that, that, that occurs. It's, it's, it's crazy. So

Yeah. I'm sure you're paying attention to this Proposition 50 thing.

No,

That's the thing in California where they're trying to re redo districts. Oh, yeah,

Yeah, yeah. Because I mean, California's already gerrymandered like crazy. Yeah. They wanna gerrymandered even more. And, and I mean, there are, 'cause it

Keeps moving further and further, right? Like if you look at the map of California, each voting cycle, more and more people are waking up and going, what the fuck? And we need to do something to fix this. The only option available other than the policies that you guys have always done Yeah. Is go right. And so a lot of people have been air, air quotes, red pilled. Yeah. And,

And, and then here's another thing that is very important in fact, that that is actually not disputed by, by either side, which is that when, when we do the census in the United States, the census, the way the census works for apportionment of congressional seats and electoral electoral college votes for the President is by a number of persons in a state, not number of citizens. Right. It's number of PE people. So you could literally be a tourist and you will count.

Now. Now, how do they do the census when they do that? Do they, is it, do they ask people, do they knock on doors? Do they have 'em fill out forms? Like what?

Yeah, I think they, they, they mail out census forms and knock on doors. But the, the way the law reads right now and, and is that all if, if you are a human with a pulse, then you count in the census for allocating congressional seats and presidential votes.

Right?

So you, you, so

Electoral college

Congressional seats, everything, everything. It doesn't matter whether you're here legally, illegally, and if, if you're a human with a pulse, you count for congressional apportionment. So that means that the more people, the more illegals that California and New York can, can import when by the time the census happens in 2030, the more congressional seats they will have and the more electoral, the more presidential electoral college votes they will have. So they're trying to get as many illegals in as possible ahead of the census. And because all hu all human beings, even tourists count for the census. And, and then if you combine that with gerrymandering of, of districts in New York and California, as you point out with this proposition where they're trying to increase the amount of gerrymandering that occurs in California, the biggest state in the country. So, so you get so, so if the, if the, the census then would award more congressional seats to California because of a vast number of illegals and New York and Illinois. So they'd get more congressional seats, they'll get more presidential electoral college votes getting that would get them the house, a majority in the house. And, and, and would, they would get to decide who is president based, literally based on legals. This isn't, these are not disputed facts by either party. I want emphasize that. That's inkin. Yeah.

This is not a

Dispute. These are not disputed facts by either party. It's not a, these are just, this is just the, the way the law works. It, it's, it is a, you know, like, I don't think the law should work that way. I think it should. The, the apportionment should be proportionate to, to, to citizens.

But isn't that a problem with how the constitution is written? Yeah, yeah. Yeah. They can't really change that.

I, I I'm not sure if it's constitutional or, but it, it, it, it is the way the law is written. I'm not sure if it's in the constitution or not in this way, but, but it is, that is the way the law is written. So

It is an incentive and, but it's an incentive that would be removed with something simple that makes sense to everybody. That only the people that should count are people that are official US citizens.

Yes. The way, the way it should work is that only US citizens should count on the census for purposes of, of determining voting power.

Because people that aren't legal can't vote.

Supposedly. They're not supposed to be voting. But, but they do. But, but even, even if, even besides that, like I said, I I, I just can't emphasize this s enough 'cause this is a very important concept for people to understand, is that the law, the, the law as it stands, counts all humans with a pulse in, in, in, in a state for deciding how many house of representative votes and how many presidential electoral college votes as a state gets. So the incentive, therefore is to, for California, New York, Illinois, to maximize the number of illegals. So they get, so, they get, so that they take house seats away from red states, assign them to California and New York, Illinois, and so forth. Then, then you combine that with extreme gerrymandering in, in, you know, California, New York, Illinois and, and whatnot. So that, that basically, you, you can't even elect any Republicans. And then they get control of the presidency, control of the house. Then they keep doing that strategy and, and cement a super majority that is what they're trying to do.

So that would essentially turn the entire country into California. Yes. Well, you have differing opinions, but it doesn't matter because one party is always in control.

Yes. When

You first started digging into this, when you first started, before you even accepted this role of running Doge and being a part of all that, did you have any idea that it was this fucked up?

I, I did. Yeah. I, I mean, I sort of

When did you start knowing,

I guess about like, well, about two years ago.

Isn't that crazy? Yeah.

Like relatively recently, you know? Yeah. So maybe I started, I started having, well, I, I started had like, basically had having a bad feeling about three years ago, which is why, which was, which is when, why, why? I felt it was like critical to acquire Twitter and have a maximally truth seeking platform. Not one that suppresses the truth. And like, it, it was more, it was more like I, I, I'm like, I'm not sure what's going on, but I have a, I have a bad feeling about what's going on. And then the more I dug into it, the, the more I was like, holy shit, we got a real problem here and America's gonna fall. So

Without anyone knowing it had fallen, that's, that would be the problem. It could have fallen and been unrepairable without anyone really being aware Yeah. Of what had happened. Especially if you didn't buy Twitter.

Yes. That's, that's, look, buying Twitter was a, a huge pain in the ass and made me a, a a a pin cushion of attacks. Like dab dap, dap, dap dap. Everybody

Loved you before that.

Well, some people, it's a love,

A lot of people loved you, a lot of lefties loved you.

I I was a hero of the left. It's fair to say

It was a thing if you drove a Tesla, it showed that you were environmentally conscious. Yes. And you were on the right side.

Yeah. Yeah. I mean, I'm still the same human. I didn't like have a brain transplant between, you know, since in like three years ago, you know. Well,

That's my favorite pumper sticker that people put on Teslas. Now, I bought this before Elon went crazy. I took a picture of one the other day. Oh,

You found his? I

Was behind somebody. Oh yeah. I've seen, I've seen three or four of 'em. People that have these bumper stickers on their car that says, I bought this before Elon went crazy because when people were

Vandalizing

Teslas

Yeah. The most audience,

There

Was organized campaign to literally burn down Teslas. And, and we had, one of our dealerships got shot up with a gun. Like they fired bullets into the, in the Tesla dealership. They're burning down cars. It was crazy. So, but the bumper sticker should read, there should be an, an addendum to the bumper sticker. It's like, I bought this car before Elon turned crazy, actually. Now I realize he's not crazy. And I've seen the light

That'll take some time. That'll take some time. People don't want to admit that they've been tricked.

Yeah. I mean, they don't like that, that old saying where it's like, it's really easy to fool somebody, but it's almost impossible to convince someone that they were fooled.

Yeah. It's much easier to fool them than to convince 'em they've been fooled. People clinging to their ideas. Yes. They, especially if they've like publicly stated these things, they've, they get very embarrassed of being foolish.

Yeah. People most time they double down and, and

They find echo chambers.

Yeah. Yeah. But, but there's, you, you know, the thing is that like I, you know, I've seen more and more people who were convinced of the sort of woke ideology. See the light? Yeah. So not everyone, but it's more and more are seeing the light. And, and it tends to happen like when, when something happens that really, you know, directly affects you. Right. You know, like there was a friend of mine who was living in, in the San Francisco Bay area, and that tried to trans his, his, his daughter, like to the point where the, the, the school like sent sent the police to his house to take his daughter away from him. Now, now that's gonna radicalize you. Well, that's gonna break, that's gonna shake you outta your belief structure. Now. I know.

Now, now that's gonna radicalize you. Well, that's gonna break, that's gonna shake you outta your belief structure. Now. I know.

So it was an activist at the school Yeah. That was trying to do this. Yeah.

The school and the, and the state of California conspired to turn his daughter against him and make her take life altering drugs that would've sterilized her and ir irreversible

And how old was she?

I think 14. Something like that. So, and he, he managed to talk the police out of taking his daughter away from him that day. And that, that night he got on a plane to Texas.

Wow.

And a, you know, a year la after just being in, in a, in a school in like greater Austin area. She, she went, she came, went back to normal meaning like the, it it, it wasn't real.

Right. Well, people are being much more open to that now. I mean, wall Street Journal yesterday had that opinion piece that this whole trans thing, there's a lot of evidence. It's a social contagion. Absolutely. And Colin Wright wrote that and then there he's getting death threats now. Of course. And on Blue sky, there's people talking about it. Yep. Exterminating him. Which is one thing that you are allowed to say on Blue Sky. Apparently you're, you're allowed to say horrible things about people say possibly truthful things about this whole social contagion. 'cause that's what, when you get nine kids that are in a friend group and they all decide to turn trans together. Yeah. Something's wrong. Something's wrong. That's not statistically

Like here's feasible. You can convince kids to do anything. You can convince kids to be a suicide bomber. Right.

Which is why they do with, in, in some countries why they choose children to do that. Yes.

You can train kids to be suicide bombers and if you can train kids to be suicide bombers, you could convince him of anything.

Yeah. Especially with enough positive enforcement Yeah. And cultural enforcement. And you, and, and the idea that, that that's not the case.

The kids, kids are, kids are malleable. Yeah. The, the minds of youth are easily corrupted. You're

Also seeing a lot of pushback from gay and lesbian people that are saying like, Hey, if someone did

This, so stop including me. So Yeah, exactly. Yeah. The L-G-B-T-Q, you know, it's like, wait a second, why are we being included all the time in this situation? Exactly.

Exactly. When, especially when, you know, like my friend Tim Dylan's talked about this, it's like, it's really homophobic because you're taking these gay kids and you're, you're telling them like, Hey, you're not gay. You're actually a girl. Yes. And you know, hey, hey, go make it so that you can never have an orgasm again and you'll be happy. Like Yeah.

It's fucking crazy. Like permanent permanent mutilation. Permanent castration of, of kids is like, I, I think I we should look at, at anyone who permanently castrates a kid as like right up there with Joseph Maner. Yeah. I mean they're, they're mutilating children.

Yeah. Yeah. And it's thought of as being kind and the thing Yeah. Would you rather have a live daughter or a dead son?

That's that's the, that's the line they use.

Yeah. Which is not supported by any data.

No, it's all bullshit. In fact, the, the probability of suicide increases. Right. Because this is important maybe for the audience to know the probability of suicide increases if you trans a kid not decreases by some accounts it triples. So that, that is an evil lie.

And it's a lie that is supposedly compassionate. Imagine you've twisted reality to the point where confusing a child that's not even legally allowed to get a fucking tattoo. Yeah. Right. Because you think that you could make a mistake with a tattoo. Exactly. A totally removable thing. Right. If I wanted to tomorrow I could go to a doctor and they could laser off every tattoo that I have on me. Right. Okay. No harm, no foul. Yeah. But you get sterilized, like that's it. Forever. Forever. Yes. Yes. They'll castrate you. You no longer have testicles. You

Have Yes. That's not coming

Back. Have no penis. You have a hole where your penis used to be. Yes. And this is compassionate and this is preventing

You from, and actually a lot of kids die in, in, in with the, these sex change operations. They die. The, the number of deaths on the operating table. People don't hear about this a lot of the kids because that we, it, it's, we don't really actually have the technology to make this work. So a bunch of the times the kids just die in this exchange operations

Jesus

Christ. Yeah. It's, it's demented. Which it should be viewed as like, you know, like, like evil Nazi doctor stuff, basically.

Well, that's why it's,

It was so like real Nazi, not the bullshit fake Nazi stuff.

Crazy that even pushing back against something that seems like fundamentally logically very easy to argue, the old Twitter would ban you forever.

Yes.

That's how crazy a social contagion can get when it completely defies logic victimizes children. Yeah. Does something that makes no sense, does not supported by data all connected to this ideology that trans is good. We gotta save trans kids. Protect trans kids.

Yeah. And what I want to emphasize is that the, the save trans kids thing is a lie. If if if you, if you, if you castrate kids and trans them, the probability of suicide increases, it does not decrease. It substantially increases the, the, the, the studies have done that. I've seen that the risk of suicide triples if you trans kids. So you're not saving them, you're killing them. Moreover, during the sex change operation, there are many deaths that occur during the sex change operation.

Jesus Christ. It's just crazy that this is a real issue.

Yeah. It it's a nightmare fever dream. And, and people are finally waking up from it.

Now, when you started getting into the Doge stuff and started finding how much money is being shuffled around and moved around to NGOs and how much money is involved and just totally untraceable funds, like this is again, something like two years plus ago. You weren't aware of it all?

No, I was aware of it. I just didn't realize how, how the, how big it was. It was just, just, just how much waste and forward there is in the government is truly vast. In fact, the government didn't even know, nor did they care.

That's crazy. Yeah. And I mean,

Just like some of the very basic stuff that Doge did will have lasting effects. And some of these things like they're so elementary, you can't believe it. So the, the Doge team got the, you know, the, the, the mo most of the main payments computers to require the, the congressional appropriation code. So when a payment is made, you have to actually enter the congressional appropriation code that used to be optional and, and often would be just left blank. So the money would just go out. But it wasn't even tied to a, a congressional appropriation. Then they also, doge team also made the comment field for the payment mandatory. So you have to say something we're, we're not saying that what, what is said, like you can say anything. You, you, you could, your cat could run across the keyboard. You could go query A SDF, but you have to say something above nothing. Because what we found was that there were tens of billions, maybe hundreds of billions of dollars. There were zombie payments. So there, like somebody had approved a payment, something the government approved a payment and some recurring payment and they retired or died or changed jobs and no one turned the money off. So the money would just keep going out. And, and it's a pretty rare

And go where

To, to a company or an individual. And it's a pretty rare company or individual who will complain that they're getting money that they should not get. And, and a bunch of the money was just going to the, were transfer payments to the states. So

These are automatic payments there.

Yeah. Just automatic payments.

No accounting for them at all. Like

Imagine like, like there's an automatic debit of your credit card and you don't, you never look at the statement. Right. So it it is just money going out. I call 'em zombie payments that there might have been, there might have been legitimate at one point, but the person who approved that recurring payment changed jobs, died, retired or whatever. And no one ever turned the money off. And my my guess is that's probably at least a hundred billion dollars a year, maybe 200

And going where?

To, to, I mean there, there are millions of these payments. So, so it's, I mean,

Millions.

Yes. Yes.

Millions of payments that are going to, who knows where.

Yes. So in a bunch of cases, there are fraud rings that operate, professional fraud rings that operate to exploit the system. They figure out some security hole in the system and they just do professional fraud. And, you know, that's where we found, for example, people who were, you know, 300 years old in the Social security administration database.

Now I thought that this was a mistake of not registering their deaths. That people were born like a long time ago and it had defaulted to like a certain number. And so that after time those people were still in the system. It was just an error of the, the way the accounting was done.

Yeah. So that's not true. So there's, or or at least one of two things must be true. The, there's a, there's a typo or, or some mistake in the computer or it's fraudulent. But we don't have any 300 year old vampires living in America. Allegedly. Allegedly. And, or, or, and we don't have people in some cases who, who are receiving payments who are born in the future. Born in the future. Born in the future. Really? Yes. There were, there, there the people receiving payments whose birth date was like in 2100 and something. Okay. So there's

There like

Next century is

There a task course?

So we know, we know that one of two things must be true. That, that there, that either there's a mistake in the computer or it's fraud, but if you have someone's birth date that's either in the future or where they're older than the oldest living American. 'cause the oldest living American is 114 years old. So if they're more than 114 years old, there was either a mistake and someone should, should call them and say, I I think we have your birthday wrong. Because it says you were born in 17, you know, eighty, eighty six. And you know, that was before, you know, you know, before there was really in America, you know, it was like, it was like, you know, it's kind of early, you know, we're still fighting England type of thing. You know, it's like this person either needs to be the Guinness Book or World Records or, or they're not alive. But still

At the end of the day, money is going towards that account that's connected to this person that is either non-existent or

Dead. So like yeah, so there was like, I think something like on a 20 million people in the Social Security administration database that could not possibly be alive if their birthdate is like, based on their birthdate, they could not possibly be alive.

And then to be clear, 20 million people that were receiving funds,

A bunch of, most of them were not receiving funds. Some of them were receiving funds. Most were not receiving funds. But, so lemme tell you how the scam works. It's, it's a bank shot. So the Social Security administration database is used as the source of truth by all the other databases that the government uses. So even if they stop the payments on the Social Security administration database like unemployment insurance, small business administration, student loans, all check the Social security administration database to say, is this, is this a a legitimate alive person? And and if the social security database will say, yes, this person is still alive, even though they're 200 years old, but forget to mention that they're 200 years old, it just says, it just returns when, when the computer is queried, it says, yes, this person is live. And so then they're able to exploit the entire rest of the government ecosystem. So fake. Then you get fake student loans, then you get fake unemployment insurance, then you get like fake medical payments. And

This doesn't have to be tied to an individual where, where there's an address we can check on this person.

No, if you did do, if you just did any check at all, you would stop this. So, so, so that's that, that, that's so, so,

And how much money do you think is made

Any check, like anything at all the, the then that would start would stop the fraud? Like any effort at all. Yeah.

So there's multiple layers. Yeah. The social security number verifies that this is a real person. Right. And then the other system check up on

Can exploit every other government payment and, and every other government payment system for everything. For, like I said, small, small business administration, student loans, Medicaid, Medicare, every other government payment of which there are many, there are, there are actually hundreds of government payment systems can all be exploited so long as social security database says this person is alive. That's the nature of the scam. It's a bank shot. So then the, then the rebuttal from the Dems is like, oh, well the vast majority of the people who are marked as live in the Social Security Administration weren't receiving Social Security administration payments. That is true. What they forgot to mention is they're getting fraudulent payments from every other government program. And that's why the, the, the dams were so opposed to turning off to, to declaring someone dead who was dead because it would stop the entire other, all the other fraud from happening.

And so, but all this, is it trackable, like all this other fraud? It's tryable if they wanted to, they could chase it all down. Yeah.

It's not even hard.

And yet they're opposing cha cha chasing it all down.

They're opposing chasing it all down because it would, it turns off the money magnet for the illegals.

Wow.

Because it's very logical to, to like, like I'm saying, the most common sense things possible. If someone's got a birthday in social security, that is an impossible birthday, meaning they are older than the oldest living American or born in the future, then you should call them and say, excuse me, we seem to have your birthday wrong because it says that you're 200 years old. That's all you need to do. And, and then

You would remove them from the social security database and make that number no longer available for all those other government payments. Exactly.

Wow.

And how much money are we talking?

It's a hundred hundreds of billions of dollars.

And this is all traceable. Like you could hunt all this down.

What is like, you don't need to be Sherlock Holmes here is what I'm saying.

Well, this

Is, we, we don't need to call Sherlock Holmes for this one. Is this part of this? We just need to call the person is this and, and, and say, excuse me. We either ha we, we seem to have the, like we, we, we must have your birthday wrong because it says you're 200 years old or we're born in the future.",,,"Elon Musk is a business magnate, designer, and engineer known for his work in electric vehicles, private spaceflight, and artificial intelligence.

"birthday in social security, that is an impossible birthday, meaning they are older than the oldest living American or born in the future, then you should call them and say, excuse me, we seem to have your birthday wrong because it says that you're 200 years old. That's all you need to do. And, and then

What is like, you don't need to be Sherlock Holmes here is what I'm saying.

Well, this

Is, we, we don't need to call Sherlock Holmes for this one. Is this part of this? We just need to call the person is this and, and, and say, excuse me. We either ha we, we seem to have the, like we, we, we must have your birthday wrong because it says you're 200 years old or we're born in the future. So could you tell us what your birthday is? That's what we need to do. It says that simple.

But the, all these other government payments that are available that are connected to this social security number, it seems like if you just chased that all down Yeah. You would find the widespread fraud you would find where it's going.

Yes. The the but the, the root of the problem is the social security Right. Administration database. Because the social security number in the United States is used as a defacto national ID number. You know, that's why like the bank always asks for your social, right. So like the, you know, any financial institution will ask for your social security number.

This is, it sounds so insane that this isn't chased down. I mean, like I agree that, I mean, I mean that in and of itself is, that's such mishandling.

Yes.

No, it's my, it's mind blowing. So Yeah. It's crazy.

Well, you were very reluctant last time you were here to talk about the extent of some of the fraud. 'cause you're like, they could kill me because this is kind of, oh,

What, yeah, what I was saying is that the, like if you create, if like I, I like, like to be pragmatic and realistic, you actually can't manage to zero fraud. You, you can manage to low fraud number, but not to zero fraud. If you manage to zero fraud, you, you, you're gonna push so many people over the edge who are receiving fraudulent payments that the number of inbound homicidal maniacs will be really hard to overcome. So I I'm, I'm, I'm actually taking I think, quite a reasonable position, which is that we should simply reduce the amount of fraud, which I think is not an extremist position and we should aspire to, you know, have less fraud over time. Not that we should be altered the draconian and eliminate every last scrap of fraud, which I guess would be nice to have. But, but like, we don't even need to go that extreme. I'm, I'm saying we should just stop the latent large scale super obvious fraud. I think that's a reasonable position. It's

A very reasonable position. Yeah. And so what was the most shocking pushback that you got when you started implementing Doge, when you started investigating into where money was going?

Well, I guess it, this was, I should have anticipated this, but while most of the fraudulent government payments to, especially to the NGOs go to the Democrats, most of it like, I don't know for argument's sake, let's say 80%, not maybe 90%, 10 to 20% of it does go to Republicans. And so when turn off funding to a fraudulent NGO would get complaints from whatever the 10% of Republicans who were receiving the money and, and they would, you know, they would very loudly complain because they're the, the, the honest answer is the Republicans are, are partly they're receiving some of the fraud too. They're getting a vig

Jesus.

Yeah. It's, it's, I wanna be clear, it's, it's not like the Republican party is some no ultrapure paragon of virtue here. No. Okay. Well

You see that with the Congressional insider training. It's across the board.

Yeah.

It's left and right.

I mean, the whole uni party criticism has some validity to it. You know, there's so, and it's, it's like if you turn off fraudulent payments, it's not like, like I said, it's not like 100% of those payments were going to, to Democrats a, a small percentage were go also going to Republicans. Those republicans complain very loudly. And you know, and, and that's, that's, so they, there there was a lot of pushback on the Republican side for when we started cutting some of these, these funds. And I tried telling 'em like, well, you know, 90% of the money is going to your opponents, but they still, if they, even if they're getting 10% of money, they want their

Peace.

Yeah. They want their peace.

And they've been getting that piece for a long time. Yes. Did you

Think this is why like, you know, politics is like

It's dirty business?

Yeah, I mean that's like saying if like, you know, if, if you, if you like sausages and respect the Lord, do not watch either of them being, being made.

Yeah,

Yeah,

Yeah. Wow.

Well that's not even true because I've made sausage before.

Yeah, yeah. It's

Actually, yeah, it's like, it's not that big a deal. Yeah. Fat and spices and casing run it through the machine. Not that big a deal.

Yeah. But yeah, I mean I I I think the stuff I'm saying here is not like, like if you, if you stand back and think about it for a second, like, oh yeah, that, that makes sense. You know? Yeah. The, it, it's, it's not like it, it's not like one political party's gonna be, you know, pure devil or pure angel. There, there's, you know, I think there's, there's, there's, there's much more corruption on the Democrat side, but it's not, there's not, there's still some corruption on the Republican side. How

Did it happen that the majority of the corruption wound up being on the Democrat side?

Well, because the, the, the, the transfer payments, especially to illegals are very much on the Democrat side. That,

So that's the root of it all is the illegal situation.

Yes. I mean there's, or

A focal

Point. Yes. It, it's also like, it's, it's, it's, it would also be accurate to say that while o obviously not everyone who is a Democrat is a criminal, almost everyone who is a criminal is a Democrat because, because the Democrats are the soft on crime party. So if you're a criminal, who are you gonna vote for?

Right?

Right. The soft on crime party,

Did you think you were going to be able to get more done than you were?

We did get a lot done. Right. And Doge is still, still still happening by the way, the, this, the, the doge is still underway. There are still, there are still, there's still waste and fraud being, being cut by by the Doge team. So it hasn't stopped the, it's less

Publicized.

It's less publicized. And they don't have like a clear person to attack anymore.

Well, it seems like once you stepped

Away, they're, they're, they're basically, they, they, they applied immense pressure to me to just, to stop it. So then I'm like, the best thing for me is to just, you know, cut outta this. And in any case, as a special governor employee, I could only be there for like 120 days anyway. Something like that. So whatever the law says, so I, I could, I I I was necessarily could only be there for four months as a special government employee. So, but yeah, I mean, I mean, you turn off the money spigot to, to fraudsters, they get very upset to say the least. And, but my, like, my death threat level went ballistic, you know, it was like a, like a rocket going orbit. Yeah. So, but now that, now, now that I'm not in DC that, that, that I, that I guess they don't really have a person to attack anymore. Well,

The rhetoric about you has calmed down Si significantly.

Yeah.

It was disturbing. It was disturbing to watch. It was like, this is crazy. Yeah. And to watch these politicians engage in it and all these people just like framing you, it was this monster. I was like, this is so weird. Like, this is what happens when you uncover fraud. Yes. The whole machine turns on you. Yeah. And if it wasn't for a person like you who owns a platform and has an enormous amount of money, like it could have destroyed you.

Yeah.

And that was the goal.

The goal was to destroy me. Absolutely. Because

You were getting in the way Yeah. Of this amazing graft. The,

The, the this gigantic fraud machine. Yeah. Like I said, I think we, we've, we've, I think those teams Aren done a lot of good work, you know, in in, in terms of fraud and waste prevented, my guess is it's, you know, probably on the order of two or 300 billion a year. So it's pretty good.

What do you think could have been done if you just had like full reign and total cooperation? How much do you think you could have saved?

I mean, what level of p of power are we assuming here? God-like, oh yeah, I could probably cut the federal budget in half and get more done.

That is so crazy. It is so crazy that it, it's

That, yeah. Get more done and federal vision half widespread,

It's that widespread.

Well, I mean, a whole bunch of government departments simply shouldn't exist in my opinion. They, they, they, you know,

Like examples,

Well, the Department of Ed, department of Education, which was created recently, like under Jimmy Carter, the, our education results have gone downhill ever since it was created. So if you, if you create a department and the result of creating that department is a massive decline in educational results and it's department of education, you're better off not having it because we're literally, we, we were did better before there was one than after

When you let the states run it. Yes. Yeah. Because

At least the states can compete with one another. So, but the problem is like here, like cutting department, educational, our kids need education. Yeah, they do. But, but this is a new department that didn't even exist, you know, until late, the late seventies. And ever since that department was created, the results, educational results have declined. And so why would you ha have an institution continue that has made education worse? It doesn't make sense. They

Killed it though, right? No,

There still is, unfortunately.

But they were trying to kill it.

It has been substantially reduced.

Okay.

What

Other organizations, what other departments? Well,

I mean, I'm a small government guy, so, you know, when, when the, you know, when the country was created, we just, we, we just had the department of state, department of War, you know, and, and sort of the, sort of the Department of Justice. We had an attorney general and treasury department. I don't know why you need more than that.

I, so what are the departments specifically do you think are just completely ineffective?

Well, I mean, here it's like a question, it's a sort of philosophical question of how much government do you think there should be?

Right.

In, in my opinion, there should be the least amount of government. I've

Heard the most bizarre argument against this is that you're cutting jobs and you're gonna leave people jobless. And I'm like, but their jobs are useless.

Detrimental. Yeah. Paying people, detrimental people to do nothing doesn't make sense. Right. Like there's a, like a, a a great, I this is a story about like Milton Friedman who's awesome, what, like, generally whatever Milton Friedman said is, you know, people should, should do that thing. I'm not sure if it's apocryphal or not, but like, like someone complained to him, like, or he, he, he observed I think people that were like digging ditches with, you know, with, with shovels. And, and he said, well, like allegedly Freeman said, well I think I think you should use, you know, excavating equipment instead of shovels and you could get it done with far fewer people. And then, and then someone said, but then we're gonna lose a lot of jobs. Well, in that then freedom was says, well, in that case, why don't you have 'em use teaspoons?

Just,

Just dig ditches with teaspoons. Think of all the jobs you'll create. I, I mean It's bullshit basically you just want people to work on, on things that are, that are productive. You want people to work on, on building things, on building, you know, providing products and services that people find valuable. Like, you know, making food, being, you know, being a farmer or a plumber or electrician or just anyone who's a builder or providing useful services. And that's what you want people to be doing. Not fake government jobs that, that, that don't add any value or may subtract value. Well there's also like, you know, to illustrate the absurdity of also how is the eco, how is the economy measured? Like the, the way economists measure the economy is, is is nonsensical because they'll measure any job, no matter, even if that job is a dumb job that has no point and is even counterproductive. So like, so like, like the, the joke is like, there's two economists going on a hike in the woods and they come across a a pile of she and one economist says the other, I'll pay you a hundred dollars to eat, eat that shit.

An

Economist eats the shit, gets the a hundred dollars, they, they keep walking. Then the other econom, then they come across another pile of shit. And, and the, the other economist says, now I'll pay you a hundred dollars to eat the pile of shit. So pays the, so pays the other economist a hundred dollars a pile of shit. Then they, then, then, then the way said, they said, well wait a second, we both just ate a pile of shit and we are no, and, and, and, and we're, we're, no, we, we, we, we, we, we don't have any more extra money. Like, like we both just gave the a hundred dollars back to me and we both ate a pile of shit. This doesn't make any sense. And they said, no, no, but think of the economy. 'cause that's $200 of, of in the economy that, that, that, that basically then measure eating, eating shit would count as a as as a, as a job.

This

Is, this is, this is to illustrate the absurdity of of, of e of economics.

One of the things you said when you

Eating

Knocked away, when you down as a

Job, one of the things you said when you stepped away is that you're kind of done and that it's unfixable that

Well

Or under its current form, the way people are approaching it,

You, you, you can, you can make it directionally better, but ultimately you can't fully fix the system. So I I I like, like, like, like it, it it is, it is, it would be accurate to say that even like, unless you could go like super draconian like, you know, Genghis Kahn level on, on, on cutting waste at waste and fraud, which you can't really do in a democratic country, an aspirationally democratic country, then there's no way to solve the, the, the debt crisis. So we've got, we've got national debt that's just insane where the debt payments, the interest payments and the debt exceed our entire military budget. I mean that's one, that was one of the wake up calls for me. I was like, wait a second. The interest on a national debt is bigger than the entire, the entire military budget and growing this is crazy. So, so, so even if you implement all these savings, you're only delaying the day of reckoning for when America becomes, goes bankrupt. So unless you go full gangs con, which you can't really do. So, So I came to the conclusion that the only way that the only way to get us out of the debt crisis and to prevent America from going bankrupt is AI and robotics. So like we need to grow the economy at, at a, at a, at a rate that allows us to, to pay off our debt. And I I I, I guess people just generally don't appreciate the degree to which, you know, this, the, the, the government overspending is, is a problem. But even like the social security website, this is under the Biden administration on the website, it would say like we, based on, on current demographic trends and you know, and, and, and how much money social security is bringing in versus how many social security recipients there are.",,,"Elon Musk is a business magnate, designer, and engineer known for his work in electric vehicles, private spaceflight, and artificial intelligence.

"on a national debt is bigger than the entire, the entire military budget and growing this is crazy. So, so, so even if you implement all these savings, you're only delaying the day of reckoning for when America becomes, goes bankrupt. So unless you go full gangs con, which you can't really do. So, So I came to the conclusion that the only way that the only way to get us out of the debt crisis and to prevent America from going bankrupt is AI and robotics.

And I I I, I guess people just generally don't appreciate the degree to which, you know, this, the, the, the government overspending is, is a problem. But even like the social security website, this is under the Biden administration on the website, it would say like we, based on, on current demographic trends and you know, and, and, and how much money social security is bringing in versus how many social security recipients there are. Because we have an aging population, relatively speaking, the average age, age is increasing. Social security will not be able to make, maintain its full payments I think in by 2032. So they'll, social security will have to stop or start reducing the, the, the amount of money that that's been paid people in, in about seven years.

And so the only way to fix that robotics, manufacturing raise GDP,

You've gotta basically massively increase the economic output, which is, and the only way to do that is AI and AI and robotics. So, so basically we're going bankrupt without AI and robotics, with, even with a bunch of savings. The savings, the savings, like reducing waste and forward can give us a longer runway, but it cannot ultimately hafi national debt.

So what do you think the solution is to the jobs that are gonna be lost because of AI and robotics? The jobs due to automation, the jobs due to no longer do we need human beings to do these jobs? 'cause AI's doing them, do you think it's going to be some sort of a universal basic income thing? Do you think there's gonna be some other kind of solution that has to be implemented? Because a lot of people are gonna be outta work, right?

I think there will be actually a high demand for jobs, but not necessarily the same jobs. So I mean this, this is actually, this process has been happening throughout modern history. I mean they used to be like, like doing calculations ma manually with, with, with like a pencil and paper. It used to be a job. So they used to have like buildings full of people called computers where the, the, the banks would like all you do all day is, is, is you, you'd do calculations. 'cause they didn't have computers. They didn't, they didn't have digital, didn't have digital computers that, that people do. Yeah, well it was just people would just like adding, subtract stuff on a piece of paper and, and, and that, that would be how banks would do, you know, financial processing.

And you'd have to literally go over their equations to make sure the books are balanced.

Yeah. And most times it's just simple math. Like, you know, the, like in a world before computers, how did you calculate, how did you do transactions? You had to do 'em by hand. So then when computers were introduced the job of doing, you know, bank calculations no longer existed. So people had to go do something else. And that's what's gonna happen. That what, that's what is happening at an accelerated rate due to AI and, and and then robotics.

That's the issue though, right? The accelerated rate. 'cause it's gonna be, it's

The accelerator, it's, it's, it's just happening, like I said, like AI is the supersonic tsunami. So that's what I call it supersonic tsunami. So it's

Like what other jobs will be available that aren't available now because of ai?

Well, AI will is, is really still digital. Ultimately AI can improve the productivity of, of humans who, who build things with their hands or do things with their hands like plum, you know, literally welding, electrical work, plumbing, anything that's, that's physically moving atoms. Like say like cooking food or you know, farming or, or like, like anything that's, that's physical. Those jobs will exist for a much longer time. But anything that is digital, which is like just someone at a computer doing something, AI is gonna take over those jobs like lightning

Coding, anything along those lines. Yeah, yeah.

It's gonna take over those jobs like lightning, just like it just like digital computers took over the job of people doing manual calculations, but but much faster.

So what happens to all those people? Like what kind of numbers are we talking about? You gonna lose most drivers, right? Commercial drivers, you're gonna have automated vehicles, AI controlled systems. Just like there's certain ports in China and I think it's Singapore where everything's completely automated.

Yeah, mostly. Yeah. Yeah,

Yeah. So you're gonna lose a lot of those jobs, longshoreman jobs, trucking, commercial drivers.

Yeah. I mean we actually do have a shortage of, of truck drivers, but there's, there's actually, well that's

Why California's hired so many illegals to do it. Have you seen those numbers?

Yeah, I mean the problem is like when you, when people don't know how to drive a semi-truck, which is actually a hard thing to do, then they, they crash and kill people. Yeah. A friend of mine's wife was killed by an, an illegal driving a truck and she was just out biking and there was an an an illegal who didn't know how to drive the truck or, or something. I mean, and he, he ran and ran her over. So I mean, like the thing is like for something like you, you, you can't, you can't let people drive, you know, sort of an 80,000 pound semi if, if they don't know how to do it. But in California they're just letting people do it

Because they need people to do it

Well, they also need, they want the boats and that kind of thing. But, but, but yeah, like cars are, cars are gonna be autonomous, but there's, there's just so many desk desk jobs where, where really people, what people are doing is they're processing email or they're answering the phone and, and just anything that is that, that isn't moving atoms. Like anything that is not physically like doing physical work, that will obviously be the first thing. Those jobs will be and are being eliminated by, by AI at a very rapid pace. And ultimately I working will be optional because you'll have robots plus ai and we'll have in a benign scenario, universal high income, not just universal basic income. Universal high income, meaning anyone can have any products or services that they want.

So you,

But, but there will be a lot of trauma and disruption along the way.

So you anticipate a basic income from that, that the economy will boost to such an extent that a high income would be available to almost everybody. So we'd essentially eliminate poverty

In the benign scenario. Yes. So like

The ways, there's multiple scenarios,

There are multiple scenarios, there's a lot of ways this movie can end. Like the reason I'm so concerned about AI safety is that like one of the possibilities is the terminator scenario. It's not, it's not 0%. So that's why it's like, I'm like really banging the drum on AI needs to be maximally truth seeking, like don't make, I don't force AI to believe a lie like that. The, for example, the founding fathers were actually a group of diverse women, or that misgendering is worth the nuclear war. 'cause you if, if that's the case and then you get the robots and the AI becomes omnipotent, it can enforce that outcome. And then, then like, unless you're a diverse woman, you're, you're out of the picture. So we're, we're toast.

So

That's, or you might wake up as a diverse woman one day. AI has force, you adjusted the picture and and we're now diverse woman.

Everyone's a diverse woman. So that would be Yeah, that's the, the worst possible situation. So, so what would be the steps that we would have to take in order to implement the benign solution where it's universal high income, like best case scenario, this is the path forward to universal high income for essentially every single citizen that the, the economy gets boosted by AI and robotics to such an extent that no one ever has to work again. And what about meaning for those people? Which is, which gets really weird.

Yeah. I don't know how to answer the question about meaning.

That's an individual problem, right? But it's gonna be an individual problem for millions of people.

Yeah, Well, I I mean I, I I, I guess I've like fought, fought against saying like, you know, I, you know, I've been, I've been voice saying like, Hey, we need to slow down ai, we need to slow down all these things and, and we need to, you know, not, not have a crazy AI race. I've been saying that for a long time, for 20, 20 plus years. But, but then I, you know, I came to realize that really there's two choices here. Either be a spectator or a, or a participant. And if I'm a, if I'm a spectator, I can't really influence the direction of ai, but if I'm a participant, I can try to influence the direction of AI and have a maximally true seeking AI with, with good values that loves humanity. And that's what we're trying to create with grok at XAI. And you know, the research is, I think bearing this out, like I said, the when they, when they compared, like how do AI value the weight of a human life? Grok was the only one, the only one at Theis that weighted human life equally and, and didn't and didn't say like a white guy's worth one 20th of a, of a, of a black woman's life. Literally. That's what the, they, they ca that the calculation they came up with. But again, so I'm like, this is, I'm like, this is very alarming. We should, we gotta watch this stuff.

So this is one of the things that has to happen in order to reach this benign solution.

Yeah, we we, we I I just keep

Best movie ending. Yeah.

You you want to a curious truth seeking ai and I think a curious truth seeking AI will wanna foster humanity because we are much more interesting than a bunch of rocks. Like you said. Like, like I, I love Mars, you know, but, but Mars is kind of boring. Like it is just a bunch of red rocks. It it, there's some cool stuff. It's got a tall mountain, it's got, you know, it's got the biggest reve, the biggest ravine and the tallest mountain, but there's no, there's no, there's no animals or plants or, and, and there's no people and you know, so humanity is just much more interesting if you're a curious truth seeking AI than not humanity. It's just much more interesting. I mean like as, as humans we could go for example and, and and eliminate all chimps. If we said, if we put our minds to it, we could say we could go out and we could annihilate all chimps and all gorillas. But, but we don't, there has been encroachment on their environment, but we, we actually try to preserve the, the, the chimp and gorilla habitats And, and, and I think in a good scenario, AI would do the same with, with humans. It would actually foster hu human civilization and care about human happiness. So this is, this is the thing to, to try to achieve, I think.

But what is the, what does the landscape look like if you have gr competing with open AI competing with all these different, like how does it work? Like what, what, what if you haveis that have been captured by ideologies that are side by side competing with grok. Like how do we, so this is one of the reasons why you felt like it's important to not just be a, a, an observer, but participate and then have grok be more successful and more potent than these other applications? Yes.

As long as there's at least one AI that is maximally truth seeking, curious and, you know, and for example, ways old, you know, human lives equally does not favor wine, race or gender. Then, then, then that, that, that and, and, and people are able to look at, look at, you know, at XI and compare that and say, wait a second, why are all these other ais being basically sexist and racist? And then, then that, that causes some embarrassment for the, the other ais. And then they, they they, they, they fake. They, you know, they, they improve, they tend to improve just in the, in the same way that acquiring Twitter and allowing the truth to be told and, and not suppressing the truth forced the other social media companies to be more truthful by, in, in the same way having grok be a maximally truth seeking curious AI is will force the other AI companies to be also be more truth seeking and fair.

And the funniest thing is, even though like the socialists and the Marxists are in opposition to a lot of your ideas, but if this gets implemented and you really can achieve universal high income. That's the greatest socialist solution of all time. Like literally no one will have to work.

Correct. Like, like I said. So, so there is a benign scenario here, which I think probably people will be happy with if, if as long as we, we achieve it, which is sustainable abundance, which is if, if, if everyone can have every, like, like, like if, if you ask people, like, what's the future that you want? Right? And I think a future where we haven't destroyed nature. Like you can still, we have the national parks, we have the, the Amazon rainforest is still, is still there. We haven't paved, we haven't paved the paved the rainforest, like the national beauty is still there. But, but people have, nonetheless, everyone has abundance. Everyone has excellent medical care. Everyone has whatever goods and services they want.

And we would just essentially

Just because that's, it kind of sounds like heaven

Basically. Yeah. It sounds like it is like the ideal socialist utopia and this idea that the only thing you should be doing with your time is working in order to pay your bills and feed yourself. Sounds kind of archaic considering the kind of technology that's at play. Yeah. Like a world where that's not your concern at all anymore. Everybody has money for food. Everybody has abundance, everybody has electronics in their home. Everybody essentially has a high income. Now you can kind of do whatever you want and your day can now be exploring your interests, doing things that you actually enjoy doing. Your purpose just has to shift. So instead of, you know, I'm a hard worker and this is what I do and that's how I, right. That's how I define myself. Not now you can fucking golf all day. You know, you can, whatever it is that you enjoy doing can now be your main pursuit. Yeah. Well that sounds crazy good.

Yeah. That's, that's the benign the best. That's, that's, that's the benign scenario that we should be meaningful.

The best ending to the movie is actually pretty good.

Yes. Like I think there's, there is still this question of meaning of like making sure people don't lose meaning, you know, like, so hopefully they can find meaning in ways that are not, that that's not derived from their work and

Purpose. Purpose for things that you, you know, find things that you do that you enjoy. But there's a lot of people that are independently wealthy that spend most of their time doing something they enjoy. Right. And that could be the majority of people,

Pretty much everyone.

But we'd have to rewire how people approach life, which seems to be like acceptable because you're not asking them to be enslaved. You're exactly a asking them the opposite. Like, no longer be burdened by financial worries, now go do what you like.

Yes.

Go fucking test pizza. Do whatever you want.

Yes. Pretty much. So that's, that's, that's the, that's the, that's probably the best case outcome.

That sounds like the best case outcome period for the future. If you're looking at like how much people have struggled just to feed themselves all throughout history, food, shelter, safety, if all that stuff can be fair, like how much would you solve a lot of the crime if there was a universal high income?",,,"Elon Musk is a business magnate, designer, and engineer known for his work in electric vehicles, private spaceflight, and artificial intelligence.

If you're looking at like how much people have struggled just to feed themselves all throughout history, food, shelter, safety, if all that stuff can be fair, like how much would you solve a lot of the crime if there was a universal high income? Just think of that. Like how much of crime is financially motivated, you know, the greater percentage of people that are committing crimes live in poor disenfranchised neighborhoods. So if there's no such thing anymore, if you really can achieve universal high income Yeah. That this is, it sounds like a utopian

Yes. I think some people may commit crime because they like committing crime just Oh sure. Some amount, some amount of that is they just destroy

While people out there.

Yeah. Yeah.

And obviously they've become 40 years old living a life like that. Now all of a sudden universal high income is not gonna completely stop their instincts.

Yeah. I mean, I guess if you want to have like, like say read a science fiction book or some books that, that are probably inaccurate or, or the, the least inaccurate version of the future, I'd say I'd, I'd recommend the Ian Banks books called the, the, the culture books. It's not actually a series. It's a, it's like a s sci-fi books about the future. They're generally called the Culture books, Ian Banks culture books. It's worth reading those. When

Did he write these?

He started writing them in the seventies, and I think he, the last one, I think he was, I think it was written just like around, I dunno, maybe 2010 or something. I'm not sure exactly.

I

Yeah, yeah.

Scottish author Ian Banks. Yeah. From 87 to 2012. Yeah. Interesting.

But he, but like, he wrote the, the, the, like his first book Consider Fleas. I think he started writing that in the seventies.

I, and,

But these books are incredible by the way. Oh, incredible books.

4.6 stars on Amazon. Interesting.

So,

So this gives me hope.

Yeah, yeah, yeah. This

Is the first time I've ever thought about it this way.

Yeah. Well, I mean, if, like, I'll often ask people what is the future that you want? And they have to think about it for a second. 'cause you know, they were usually tied up in whatever their daily struggles are. But, but you say, what is the future that you want? And, and generally sustainable abundance, or at least folks say, what about a future where there's sustainable abundance? Like, oh yeah, that's a pretty good future. So, you know, if, if, and that, that future is attainable with AI and robotics. But, but you know, it's, it's like I said, there's not every path is a good path. There's this, it's, but I think if we, if we push it in the direction of maximally truth seeking and curious, then I think AI will want to take to, to take care of humanity and foster foster humanity because we're interesting. And if it hasn't been programmed to think that like all straight white males should die, which Gemini was basically programmed to do at at least first, you know, they seemed to have fixed it, hopefully fixed it. But

Don't you think culturally like, oh, we're getting away from that mindset and that people realize,

Yeah, I think

We're getting away from how preposterous that all is.

We we're getting away from it. So we are getting at, at least it knows, the AI mostly knows to hide things. But like, like I said, there is that I, I think I still have that as, or I had that as my like pin pinned post on X, which was like, Hey, wait a second guys, we still have every ai except Roc is saying that basically straight white males should die and this is a problem and we should fix it. You know, but simply me saying that is like tends to generally result in, you know, them like, Ooh, that is kind of bad. Maybe we should just, we should not have all straight white males die. I think they have say also all, all, all straight Asian males should also die as well. They like, they don't like, like generally, generally the AI and the, and the media, you know, which, which ba back in the day, the AI and the, the, the media wa was, you know, racist against black people and sexist against women back in the day. Now, now it is racist against white people and Asians and ra and sexist against men. So, and over they're just like being racist and sexist. I think they just want to change the target. So, but, but really they just shouldn't be racist and sexist at all, you know, obviously.

Yeah. Ideally that would be nice.

That would be nice.

And it's kind of crazy that we were kind of moving in that general direction till around 2012 and then everything ramped up online and, and everybody was accused of being a Nazi and everybody was transphobic and racist and sexist and homophobic and everything got exaggerated to the point where it was this wild witch hunt where everyone was a colombo looking for racism.

Yeah, yeah, yeah. Totally. Well, well, but, but, but they, they were openly anti-white and often openly anti-Asian.

And then this new sentiment that you cannot be racist against white people. 'cause racism is power and influence and Okay, no it's not.

Yeah. Racism is, is is racism in the absolute. So, you know, and, and there just needs to be consistency. So if it's okay to have, let's say black or Asian or Indian or pride, it should be okay to have white pride too. Yeah. So that's just a con, that's just a consistency question. So, you know, if it, if it's okay to be proud of one religion, it should be okay to be proud of I I guess all religions provided there that, that they're, they're not like

Oppressive.

Yeah. Or, or, or don't, like, as long as part of that religion is not like exterminating people who are not in that religion type of thing.

Right.

So it's really just like a consistency bias or, or just like ensuring consistency to eliminate bias. So if it is possible to be racist a against one race, it's possible to racist against any race. So of

Course, logically yes. Yeah. And arguing against that is, that's when you know you're captured.

It's, it's, it's a, it's a logical inconsistency Yeah. That makes AI go insane.

And people,

And people go insane. Yes. What more, but like the, the like, like you can't simultaneously say that the, the the systemic racist oppression, but also that racists don't exist. That that that race ra race is a social construct. Like which is it, you know, you also can say that, you know, anyone who steps foot in America is is automatically an American except for the, the people that originally came here.

Exactly. Exactly. Except for the colonizers.

Yeah. Except for the evil colonizers who came here. Right. So which one is it like, right. If, if you step as if as soon as you step foot in a place you are, that you are just as American as everyone else, then that would've applied. If you apply that consistently, then the original white settlers were also just as American as everyone else.

Yeah.

Logically, logically.

One more thing that I have to talk to you about before you leave is the rescuing of the people from the space station, which we talked about. You were planning it the last time you were here. The fact the the lack of coverage that that got in mainstream media was one of the most shocking things that they

Seen. Yeah. They totally memory hold that thing

Wild. Yes.

Because if it, it

Wasn't

You, it's like, it's like it didn't exist.

Those people would be dead. They'd be stuck up there.

Well, they'd, they'd probably still be alive, but they'd, they'd, they'd, they'd be having bone density issues because of prolonged exposure to zero gravity. Well, they

Were already up there for like eight months. Right. Yeah. Which is an insanely long time. It takes forever to recover just from that.

Yeah. They're only supposed to be at the Space station for three to six months maximum. So

One of the things that you told me that was so crazy was that you could have gotten them sooner, but

Yeah. But for political reasons they didn't. They, they did not want SpaceX or me to be associated with returning the astronauts before the election.

That is so wild that that's a fact. Oh yeah. First of all, that even

We, we absolutely could have done it. So,

But even though you did do it and you did it after the election, it received almost no media coverage anyway.

Yes. Because nothing good con the, the, the media, which is essentially a far of pro the legacy mainstream media is a far left propaganda machine. And so anything, any story that is positive about someone who is not a part of the sort of far left tribe will not get any coverage. So I I I could save a busload of orphans and, and it, it wouldn't get a single news story.

It's, it really is nuts. It it was nuts to watch because even though it was discussed on podcasts and it was discussed on X and it was discussed on social media, it still, it was a blip in the news cycle. It was very quick. Yeah. It was in and out and because it was a successful launch and you did rescue those people, nobody got hurt. And there was nothing really to, there was no blood to talk about. Right. Just fucking in and out,

Gone. Yeah. Yeah, absolutely. Well, and, and as, as you saw firsthand with the Starship launch, like Starship is, you know, by, you know, at least by some, some would consider it to be like the most amazing, you know, engineering project that's happening on earth right now, outside of like, you know, maybe AI or AI and robotics. But, but certainly in terms of a spectacle to see it is the most spectacular thing that is happening on earth right now is, is the Starship launch program, which anyone can go and see if they just go to South Texas and just they can just run a hotel room, low cost in South Padre Island or in Brownsville, and you can see the launch and, and you can drive Right, right past the factory. 'cause it's on a public highway, but it gets no coverage or, or what coverage does get was like a rocket blew up

Coverage, so, right. Yeah. Oh, he's a fuck with the rocket blew up.

Yeah. The, the, like, the, the, the, the Sasha program is vastly, vastly more capable than the entire Apollo Moon, moon program. Vastly more capable. Th th this is a spaceship that is designed to make life multi-planetary, to carry millions of people across the heavens to another planet. The, the Apollo program could, could only send astronauts to the moon for a few hours at a time. Like they could send two, the entire Apollo program could only send astronauts to visit the moon very briefly, and then for a few hours, and then depart the Starship program could create an entire Luna base with a million people. You understand the mag the magnitudes are different, very different magnitudes here.

So what, what was the political

Resistance? But there's basically no, no coverage of it.

Yeah. But what I wanted to ask you is like, what, so what were the conversations leading up to the rescue? Like when you were like, I can get them out way quicker?

Yeah, well, I mean, you know, I raised this a few times, but it was the, I was told instructions came from the White House that, you know, that the, that there should be no attempt to rescue before the election.

That should be illegal. That, that, that really should be a, a horrendous miscarriage of justice for those poor people that were stuck on that.

Yeah. It it is, it is crazy. Have

You ever talked to those folks afterwards? Did you have conversations with them?

Yeah, I mean they, they're, they're not gonna say anything political to be, you know, they're not like, they're never gonna curse. Did

They at least say Thank you?

Yeah, yeah, yeah. Well that's nice. Yeah, yeah. Absolutely. So,

But the instructions came down from the White House. You cannot rescue them because politically this is a, a bad hand of cards.

I mean, they didn't say because politically it's a bad hand of cards, but they, they just said they weren't, they were not interested in any rescue operation before the election. Yeah. So

What did that feel like?

I wasn't surprised,

But it's crazy.

Yeah.

Because Biden could have authorized it and they could have said the, the Biden administration is helping bring those people back, throw you a little funding, give you some money to do it. The Biden administrator, they funded these people being returned.

Yeah. The Biden administration was not exactly my best friend. Thats what I heard. Especially after I, you know, you know, help Trump get elected, get get elected. Which I mean, some people still think, you know, Trump is like the, the devil, basically. And I mean, I think, I think Trump actually, he is, he is not perfect. But, but he's not evil. Trump is not evil. I mean, I spent a lot of time with, with him and he's, I mean, he's a product of his time, but he is not, he's not evil. No,

No. I don't think he's evil either. But if you look at the media coverage,

The media, the media's Theresa Nike's super evil. Yeah.

It's pretty shocking. If you look at the amount of negative coverage, like one of the things that I looked at the other day was mainstream media coverage of you trump a bunch of different Oh yeah. Public figures and then mom,

96% negative or something crazy. Yeah.

And then Momani, which is like 95% positive,

Right? I mean, Momani is, is is a charismatic swindler. I I've, I mean, you gotta hand it to him. Like he, he did, he can't light up a stage, but he is just been a swindler his entire life. And, you know, and, and I, I think he, he what? He's, I mean he's likely to win li he's likely to be mayor of New York, New York City.

Very likely.

Yeah. Very likely. I think

What poll market has it at? What, what is the 94%? 94%?

Yeah, that sounds pretty likely. That's crazy. Like, I'm not sure who the 6% are, you know, so, so, so yeah. So that's, well

It's also like who's on the other side? The fucking guardian angel guy with the Beret and Andrew Cuomo, who doesn't even have a party like the, the Democrats don't even want 'em. So you have those two options and then you have the young kids who are like finally socialism.

Yeah. They, they dunno what they're talking about, obviously. So, you know, like you just look at this, say how many boats come from Cuba to Florida and how many, but, and how many boats because you know, there's like a constant, I was thinking like, how many boats are accumulating on the shores of Florida coming from, from Cuba. Right. There's a, there's a whole bunch of free boats that you could, if you want to go take 'em back to Cuba, it's pretty close. Yeah. But for some reason people don't do that. Why? Why, why, why are the boats only coming in this direction? Well, who

Is, who are the most rabid capitalists in America? The fucking Cubans.

Absolutely.

Yeah. They're like, we've seen how this story goes.

We do not want Exactly. Yeah.

Fuck off. They don't Cubans in Miami, they don't want to hear any bullshit. They don't wanna hear any socialism bullshit. They're like, no, no, no. We know what this actually is. This isn't just some fucking dream.

Yeah. It's extreme Go oppression. Yeah.

That's what it

Always means. It's is a nightmare. And, and like the, the like and obvious way you can tell which, which ideology is, is the bad one, is who has to, which ideology is building a wall to keep people in and prevent them from escaping. Right. Like, so East Berlin built the, built the wall, not West Berlin. Right. They built the wall because people were trying to escape from communism to West Berlin, but there wasn't anyone going from West Berlin to East Berlin. Right. That's why the communist had to build a wall to keep people from escaping. They're gonna

Have to build a wall around New York City.

Yeah. That so, so you, this guy is a

Charismatic

That an ideology is problematic if that ideology has to bull day wool to keep people in with machine guns. Yes. And shoot you if you try to leave also,

There's no examples of it being successful ever. Yes. We're really working out for people. No, there's examples of a bunch of lies. Like North Korea give this land to the state, we'll be in control of food. No one goes hungry. No. Now no one can grow food. But the government, and we'll tell you exactly what you eat and you eat very little. Right? Yeah. What, when you say mom, Donny's a swindler. I know he has a bunch of fake accents that he used to use. Yeah. And, you know, but what else has he done that makes him a swindler?

Well, I, I guess if you say what I mean, if you, if you say, if you say to any audience, whatever that audience wants to hear, instead of what, instead of having a consistent message, I would say that that is a swindling thing to do and Yeah. Yeah. But but he is, he is charismatic. Yeah.

Good looking guy. Smart, charismatic. Yeah. Great. On a microphone.

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Exactly.

And, and what the young people wanna see, you know, like this ethnic guy who's young and vibrant and has all these socialist ideas aligns with them and you know, there are a bunch of broke dorks just outta college. Like, yay, let's vote for this. And there's a lot of 'em. And they're, they're activated, they're motivated,

I guess. We'll, we'll, we'll see, we'll see what happens here. What

Do you think happens if he wins? 'cause like 1% of New York City is responsible for 50% of their tax base, which is kind of nuts. 50% of the tax revenue comes from 1% of the population. And those are the people that you're scaring off. You know, you lose one half of 1%.

I dunno, I mean hopefully the, the stuff he's, he said, you know, about government takeovers of, of like that all the stores should be the government basically. Well I

Don't think he said that. I think he said gov. They wanna do government supermarkets, some state run or city run supermarkets.

Yeah, well it just, the, the, the government is the DMV at scale. So you have to say like, do you want the DMV running your supermarket?

Right.

Was your last experience that the DMV amazing. And if it wasn't, you probably don't want the government doing things.

Imagine if they were responsible for getting you blueberries.

Yeah. It's not gonna be good. I mean the, the, the thing about, you know, communism is, is it was, it was all bread lines and bad shoes. You know, do, do you want ugly shoes and bread lines? 'cause that's what communism gets you.

It's gonna be interesting to see what happens and whether or not they snap out of it and overcorrect and go to some Rudy Giuliani type character next. 'cause it's been a long time since there was any sort of Republican leader there.

I mean, we live, we live in the, in the most interesting of times because we, we, we face the, you know, simultaneously face civilizational decline and incredible prosperity. And these, these timelines are interwoven. So if, if Ma Dani's policies are put into place, especially at scale, it, it would be a catastrophic decline in living standards. Not just for the rich, but for everyone. As, as has been the case with, with every, every, for every every socialist experiment or every and Yeah. So, but, but then as you pointed out, the, the irony is that like the ultimate capitalist thing of AI and robotics enabling prosperity for all and, and abundance of goods and services, actually the capitalist implementation of AI and robotics, assuming it goes down the, the good path is, is actually what results in the communist utopia. 'cause f fate is an irony maximizer,

Right. And, and an actual socialism of maximum abundance of high income people.

Universal high income. Yeah. Like the, the, the, the problem with communism is, is this universal low income. It's, it's not that everyone gets elevated, it's that everyone gets oppressed except for a very small minority of, of politicians who live lives of luxury. That's what's happening every time it's been done. Yeah. So, but then the, the actual communist utopia, if everyone gets anything they want will be, will be if, if will be achieved. If it is achieved, it will be achieved via cap capitalism. 'cause fate is an irony. Maximizer,

I feel like we should probably end it on that. Is there anything else?

The most ironic outcome is the most likely, especially if entertaining.

Well, everything has been entertaining. Yeah. As long as the bad things aren't happening to you, it's quite fascinating. And it's never a boring moment.

Yes. I, I, so there's, I do have a theory of why, like if, if if simulation theory is true, then it is actually very likely that the most interesting outcome is the, is the most likely because only the simulations that are interesting will continue. The simulators will stop any simulations that are boring. 'cause they're, that they're not interesting.

But here's the question about the simulation theory. Is the simulation run by anyone? Or is

Yeah, it would be run by someone.

It would be run by,

Or some, some, some

Force.

The pro the program, like in, in this reality that we live in, we, we run simulations all the time. Like, so when we try to figure out if the rocket's gonna make it, we run thousands, sometimes millions of simulations just to figure out which, which path is the good path for the rocket And, and where can it go wrong? Where can it fail? But we, when we do these, I say at this point, millions of simulations of, of what can happen with the rocket. We ignore the ones that are where everything goes. Right? Because we, we, we just care about the, we have, we have to address the situations where it goes wrong. So, so, so basically, and, and, and, and, and for, for AI simulations as well, like, like all these things we, we keep the simulations going that are the most interesting to us. So if simulation theories accurate, if, if it is true, who knows, then the, the, the, the, the simulators will, will only con they will continue to run the simulations that are most interesting. The therefore from a Darwinian perspective, the only surviving simulations will be the interest, the most interesting ones. And in order to avoid getting turned off, the only rule is you must keep it interesting or you will if, or you'll, because the boring simulations will be terminated.

Are you still completely convinced that this is a simulation?

I didn't say I was completely convinced.

Well, you said it's like the odds of it not being, or in the billions, I guess that's not completely, 'cause you're saying there's a chance.

What are the odds that we're in base reality? Well, given that, given that, that we're able to create increasingly sophisticated simulations. So if you think of say, video games and how video games have gone from very simple video games like pong with, you know, two rectangles in a square to video games today being photorealistic with millions of people playing simultaneously. And all of that has occurred in our lifetime. So if that trend continues, video games will be indistinguishable from reality. The fidelity of the game will be such that you, you don't know if that what you're seeing is a real video or a fake video. And like AI generated videos at this point, you like, you can sometimes tell it's an AI generated video, but often you cannot tell and sun, you will not really just not be able to tell. So if, if that's happening in our direct observation then and, and we're we'll create millions if not billions of photorealistic simulations of reality, then what are the odds that we're in base reality versus someone else's simulation?

Well, isn't it just possible that the simulation is inevitable, but that we are in base reality building towards a simulation?

We're we're making simulations. So we're making simulations. We, we we're make like you can just think of like photo realistic video games as, as being simulations and especially as you apply Yeah. AI in these video games, like the characters in the video games will be incredibly interesting to talk to. They won't just have a limited dialogue tree where if you go to like the, the crossbow merchant or like, and you, you try to talk about any subject except buying a crossbow, they just wanna talk about selling you a crossbow. But with with with AI based non-player characters, you can, you'll be able to have an elaborate conversation with no dialogue tree. Well

That might be the solution for meaning for people. Video games, just lock games, just walk in video and you could be a fucking vampire and whatever you live in avatar land, you could do it, you could do whatever you want. I mean, you don't have to think about money or food

Ready player one. Yeah.

Literally. Yeah. But with higher living standards,

Yeah.

You don't have to be in a little trailer. I,

I mean, I, I think there people do want to have some amount of struggle or something they wanna push against, but, but it, it could be, you know, playing a, a sports or playing a game or something like that.

It could be easily playing a game. Yeah, yeah. And especially playing a game where you're now no longer worried about like physical attributes like athletics, like bad joints and hips and stuff like that. Now it's completely digital, but yet you do have meaning in pursuing this thing that you're doing all day. Whatever the fuck that means, it's gonna be weird.

It's gonna be interesting. It's gonna

Be very interesting.

The most, the most interesting and, and usually ironic outcome is the most likely.

Alright.

That's a good predictor of the future.

Andrew, how are you?

Splendid. How the Devil is.

I think it's the first time anyone's answered splendid when I ask him How you doing? So tell me about your book, man. Lemme see the cover of it. First of all,

Death by

Astonishment. Death by Astonishment, which is the famous Terrence McKenna quote, right? Yes.

He was

Off. The thing you have to Fear is Death by Astonishment. Exactly.

Yeah.

You know, the first time I did DMT, I literally heard his words Do not give into astonishment punishment. I literally heard those words. It's almost like whatever's over there. Yeah. Wanted me to hear that. Mm. So I could like sink in or whatever. 'cause I had already heard it before, you know, so they wanted to say it to me as well. It was very weird.

Yeah. It's sage advice, I think, because

Oh, it's the only way. No way. Because if you freak out, well, it's like, that's a good thing. It's good advice in most of life. Mm. Like, don't give in to the freak out. Yeah, yeah. Confronting the Mystery of the world's strangest drug. How did you get involved in this

DMT? Yes.

Oh,

So you have to go back to my teenage years. Really? So, I mean, I first heard about DMT through Terrence McKenna, a friend again,

Like most of us.

Yeah. Like most of us. But this was like, this was during like the dawn of the internet,

Right. Long before you were a scientist. Long

Before I was a scientist. Right. So, a friend gave me this magazine and had this interview with this bearded, cheeky looking bearded fellow on the back called Terrence McKenna. And he spoke about this thing called DMT, which of course I didn't know what that was, but you know, the stories that he was telling that you were gonna meet these insectoid aliens and trans dimensional machine owls, jabbering in an indecipherable tongue and singing impossible objects into existence. I mean, it sounded ridiculous, but I was kind of, I was hooked. I thought, this is it. This is, this is the most fucking incredible thing I've ever read in my life. And say I was, I was like 15, 16 years old. And there, there was one computer in the school that was hooked up to the, the worldwide web. So all of like,

What year was this?

96.

Oh, early.

I gave you my age away here, but

Early days of

The early days internet. Yeah. Yeah. So I spent all my time just, you know, going on to Alta Vista. Remember Alta Vista? I do.

Yeah. I didn't, I didn't remember it until you brought it up,

Remember? Yeah. I was just kind of trying to find out as much as I could about this, and that was what triggered my decision to study chemistry and pharmacology. My kind of academic journey was, was triggered by, I want to know, you know, it's such a cool thing, the idea that you can, you can put a molecule in your brain and it, it doesn't just change how you feel, but it completely changes the entire structure of your reality. Your entire world is, is, is obliterated and replaced with one that is completely alien. That's a relationship whatsoever to that normal awaken world. That's incredible. And I kind of wanted to try at least to understand how that actually works.

Well, the weirdest part about that molecules that your brain makes it. And so then you have to go, why? And what's the purpose of that? And what are we really, you know, what is, what is consciousness and what is, what is normal consciousness? What's the purpose of it? And why does this chemical exist? What does this molecule exist that's produced by the brain that changes everything and seems to transport you to a place that's more real than this physical reality that we find ourselves in right now.

Exactly. And that is kind of the great mystery. And I don't, I think most people who, even, even people who've kind of learned about DMT, even scientists, I mean, I, I speak to scientists. I, I engage with scientists, neuroscientists often, and they will say, oh, this is just hallucination. This is just your brain kind of making it up. And I don't think most scientists realize how confounding and how difficult to explain the DMT state is. I think it is one of, one of life's true mysteries. It is not simple to explain the DMT state.

Well, I think it's almost irresponsible to try to explain it without experiencing it. It's not gonna kill you. Yeah. It's not gonna kill you. It lasts 15 minutes. Stop being a pussy. Right. Just do it and then tell me It's just hallucination. That's it. Yeah. Just do, do a big one. Three giant hits. Come back. Tell me, this is normal. Yeah. Tell me, this is just a freak out. 'cause it sure doesn't seem like it, does it?

No, and I mean, that was what I mean, I mean, I, I first learned about DMT as I said, when I was 15 or 16, but my first experience was probab well close to a decade later. And I thought before I took it, I thought I kind of knew what to expect. I mean, I'd listened to all the Terence McCann lectures I could find. I, I'd read all the books. I read all the trip reports, and I thought, okay, I'm kind of ready for this. I kind of know what's gonna happen. And I wasn't ready. And I was shocked. I was horrified in a sense. I was appalled. I mean, this was like, this is impossible. This was an impossible experience. I was confronted with an what seemed to me to be the, the undeniable hand of some kind of intelligence, and not just any kind of intelligence, but a supremely advanced, ancient and yet highly technological intelligence. And that was undeniable to me in those first few moments. Within sort of 30 seconds of that drug hitting my, my, my brain, I knew that this is, this is something else. And I was at first horrified. I was shocked. I just thought this, what is this? And then when I finally kind of came back, I was, I was, I remember lying on my bed, on my back, like shaking to my very bones. And all I could say was, oh my fucking God. Because I was completely confounded. You know? I mean, and by then I was a chemical pharmacologist. I was assigned it. I should, I should,

Yeah.

I should know what's going on here. But I had no idea what was going on. And I thought, this is, this is it. This is what I need to get to grips with.

It also gives you a very, like an, an unusual understanding of the mechanisms that you interface with the world. Like, like ego and logic and reasoning and rational thinking. It gives you like this understanding that those are kind of just these weird tools that you use to get by. And you're left without them in there. It just, they, they evaporate and dissolve. And then when you come back, you're like, what am I doing? Yeah. The way I talk. Like, what, what is my, what's my purpose of interacting with people? Like what, how much of the way I talk to people. It's this weird social dance, weird ego, performative, sort of like the way I structure sentences, the way I communicate. It all seemed so clunky. When, when you come back and you just go, wow, we are a mess. Like collectively as a species, we're so without some sort of awakening or some, some kind of experience, some sort of a psychedelic profound breakthrough experience. Like you're so hampered by your physical existence and this sort of ancient tribal programming that we have that we're running through this maze of life with. And you come back and go, God, this is so weird.

Yeah. I think what DMT does is, is show you that everything, everything you thought you knew about how reality is structured and what's, what's real and what's not real, what is fantasy, what's possible, and what's not possible. Yeah. All of that is, is completely kind of extubated in an instant. And you realize, actually we don't, we don't have a fucking clue about the way things really are. I think DMT just demonstrates that, whether You understand it, whether we can, we can really understand what's going on in the brain and why, and how this experience is even possible. It just shows you how little we really understand about the, the nature of this

Of reality.

So you've done some like legitimate studies with DMT,

Right? Yeah, I mean, I work mainly kind of, I guess you could say theoretically, in that I do more quantitative and qualitative analysis of the DMT state and try to understand, try to use the tools of neuroscience to try to understand how DMT elicits its its effects. So we can kind of get into, if you want Sure. If you wanna go really deep. Yeah, sure. I can give you a kind of a, a neuroscience lesson. Yeah. Please. Can talk about, so, so, you know, if you wanna understand DMT, we kind of have to start with the, the basic observation. You know, before you take DMT, you are experiencing a world, right? Whenever you're awake and conscious, you're experiencing a world, the normal waking world, this is the world that's kind of familiar to us. When you take DMT, that world is transformed. It disappears, it's obliterated, and it's replaced with one that is altogether stranger, shall we say. And so, so what I want to do is kind of understand, first of all how that happens, what's actually going on in the brain to cause that transition and why that happens. And you can't do that unless you have a, a decent understanding of the normal waking world. So what is the normal waking world? It's a model. It's an interface generated by your brain. So you have this world building machinery on the outerlay of your brain called the cortex. And this is generating your world all the time. All the features of the world that you're experiencing are represented within the cortex. And that applies whether you are just normal waking life. It applies in dreaming, it even applies in the psychedelic state. The world that you experience is, is always constructed as a model by the brain. And so what that means is that psychedelics, what they're doing is they're man, they're perturbing the brain. They're manipulating the brain and altering that model. Now, for example, with, let's say psilocybin from magic mushrooms, psilocybin binds to this receptor in the brain called the five HD two A receptor, which you're probably familiar with, the cy serotonin receptor. And so this is a, it's, it's called an excitatory receptor. It stimulates these neurons, which your cortex is constructed from, makes them more excitable, makes them more likely to fire and share information between two other neurons. You get this kind of loosening up of the, the world model that your brain is constructing. So the walls start to breathe, objects seem to kind of change their identity. Everything becomes more fluid and dynamic. And if you put someone into an MRI machine, for example, you can actually see that in the normal waking state. You can see the neural activity. It, it's, it's dynamic, but it's, it's kind of organized and well orchestrated. You give someone psilocybin, let's say, or LSD, and you start to see the activity becoming sort of more random and fluid. So you get this, this state of slightly increased disorder as if the, the, the, the kind of the tuning dial between order and disorder in the brain has been slightly nudged towards disorder. But then with DMT, something remarkable happens in the, the early stages of the experience. You get this kind of quite chaotic state suggesting that the rain is entering this more disordered state, but then it kind of collapses into this brand new order. So you go from the order of the normal waking world to this disordered state, and then you collapse into this completely different type of order. So the brain is effectively constructing an entirely different model of reality. It's no longer the normal waking world model, which acts as kind of an interface with the environment, but it's constructing a, a completely different world model.

When you say constructing, why do you use that term? What, why do you use the brain is constructing

Because you are, well, okay, so, so if you think about, you know, how does the brain interact with the, how do we interact with the environment using our senses, right? So light information comes through the eyes, the retina, and it stimulates the, the very back of the brain. You have an area. Oh,

Oh, you brought slides.

I brought slides. There we

Go.

Yeah, maybe the next one, Jamie, is a bit easier to see. There we go. So at the right, the back of the brain here, you have an area called V one, which is the primary visual cortex. That's your interface with the world. Sensory information comes and strikes, it activates patterns of neural activity in V one. But it's very, very messy. It's like lines and patches of color and, you know, lines moving in certain directions. It's a mess, right? It's very noisy, it's very messy. It's incredibly dynamic. It doesn't make any sense. And so what your brain does is it has another level above V one that kind of has a bird's eye view and is looking for patterns within this neural activity in this lowest level. So it's looking, saying, oh, those lines kind of could be a triangle, or this could be a circle. It's trying to find patterns to try generate order from this messy level in V one. Can I

Ask you this? How do we know it does that?

That's a good question. Well, there are a number of things. So the earliest evidence came from a, one of the earliest forms of evidence came from a guy called Wilder Penfield. Are you familiar with No. So Wilder Penfield, he was interested in treating epilepsy, and he invented something called the Montreal procedure where he would remove a part of the brain that was the focus of epileptiform activity. The idea being that it would kind of cure someone's epilepsy. But before he could do that, of course he needed to make sure that he wasn't removing, you know, important parts for someone's function. So what he would do is he would cut the top of their skull off when they're still awake. Yeah. And kind of expose their brain. And then he would zap different parts of their brain and say, you know, what's happening?",,,"Andrew Gallimore, PhD, is a chemical pharmacologist and neurobiologist.

Can you imagine?

Isn't it crazy that that's how we have to find out what works? We have to, like, it's the aliens probably look at us and go, oh my God, you guys are still doing that. Yeah.

Nowadays things have moved on a bit, right? I'm

Sure. But I mean, this is not that long ago, right? How long ago

Is this? 1950s. Yeah.

Okay. Yeah. Not even a hundred years. Right, exactly. So a hundred years ago, they were literally taking your skull and turning it into a hat.

They would

Popping the cap off, the cap off and just, okay, yeah, let's see what this does exactly.

They would zap it. And what he noticed is that when he would zap right at the back of the brain, so this is the, this primary visual cortex that's receiving information from an environment, they would, this, his patients would say, oh, I see flashes of light. I see lines, I see colors with very simple kind of things. But then he would move forward to kind of higher levels that we know now are kind of high levels. And then they'd say, oh, I see triangles, or I see an orange circle, things like this. Then he'd keep going higher and higher. And then they'd say, oh, I see people, or I see cops and robbers. And then right at the top you reach an area called the hippocampus, which you may have heard of involved in memory. And the hippocampus basically keeps an eye, it's a bird's eye view of the all of this world model. Your brain is constructing and it's kind of following and looking for, you know, interesting or important patterns. And when he stimulated that, his patients would actually report memories. They would say, oh, I hear somebody talking to me. You know, this happened this morning when I was leaving the house. My mother was telling me something about, you know, you've got your coat on backwards or something like this. So you have these levels of, of the cortex that go from very simple, Kind of very funda, low level visual data at, at the bottom end. And then at the very top, you've got kind of higher order things such as, you know, faces or people. This is sitting at the top now. Interesting. Have you ever, when you are dreaming, right? So when you, let's think about dreaming for a second. It's quite instructive, I think, when you are dreaming, right, the brain is actually constructing the world in basically the same way as it does when you are awake. Dreams are kind of selective simulations of the waking world. The difference, of course is there's no sensory inputs. So if you scan someone's brain while they're having a dream, you'll see that this back of the brain, this primary visual cortex is kind of quiet. The brain is kind of using what it's learned about building the world in the normal waking state to construct the dream world. So the dream world is built in exactly, it's built from exactly the same stuff as the normal waking world. However, there's interesting features. If you in a dream, have you ever tried to use your cell phone or

No,

Not many people have. What about read a book in a dream?

I don't think so. One, one thing I have learned to do is to, I think I saw it in a movie. If you knock on a door, you'll realize that you're in a dream.

And this waking life,

I don't remember what movie it was, but it was a, a guy who was instructing how to lucid dream. And that if you make a habit of walking through a doorway in your home, and every time you walk in through a doorway in your home, tap on the door, the doorway, knock on it with your hand and say, am I awake? Knock, knock, knock. And then you'll get in a habit of doing that every time you go through a doorway. And if you go through a doorway in your dream, you'll do it. You'll say, am I awake? And then as you go to knock, knock, knock, you're like, oh shit, I'm dreaming. There we go. And then you realize, and if you don't give into astonishment, you can maintain that dream. You can that dream, right? It's, that's the thing. It's like, oh my God, I'm dreaming. I can't believe this. And then you wake up, right? You get too freaked out and you wake up. But if you don't do it, and I've only been able to do this a few times 'cause I don't really knock. I did it for a while after the movie. I saw the movie, I tried it for a while, and I did have a dream like that where I went through a doorway and I said, am I dreaming? And I'm like, oh my God, I'm dreaming. And then I, I realized I was dreaming, and then I was like flying. I was doing a lot of weird stuff. But then it went away, and then I stopped doing it. And I've always been like, wow, why don't I practice lucid? I'm, I've always, I've thought about it like a dozen times at least. Like, why don't I just get a book on lucid dreaming and really try to attempt to learn the techniques and, and I never do. Yeah,

It takes commitment. But now there's actually a simpler way of that kind of reality tests. A simpler way now is to get out your cell phone, occasionally open up the, the calculator and do a, do a few calculations and just check everything's working right? Or open up a book and, and try to read it. Because the thing about the dream world is, again, just like the normal waking world, it's, it's, it's constructed over kind of levels of a hierarchy from the highest level models. So your brain can construct a high level model of a, a cell phone quite easily. But all of the fine details of how it functions, that's all represented at the lowest level of the cortex. That's really dependent on sensory inputs. So you can dream of having your mobile phone in your hand and doing with it, but as soon as you try to do something with it through, actually your brain has to kind of construct that function. And it do, it can't do it unless it has access to sensory inputs. And so that's how you can test if you are lucid dreaming. Okay. Yeah. And, and which is why the DMT state is so fascinating is because it's, it's nothing like the dream state. People say, you know, that, that perhaps DMT is released when you are dreaming and that it actually triggers, I mean, this, this goes back to the 1980s. There's a, a, a, a theoretical paper published by a guy called Jace Callaway. And he said, oh, maybe DMT could be produced during REM sleep because it's closely related to melatonin, structurally both kind of tryptamine structures. But when you analyze the, the phenomenology, you know, the actual experience of DMT, it's nothing like dreaming. You know, dreaming is generally the brain making use of what it knows about how to construct the world in the waking state and doing so in the dream state. So that's why if you ask people, you know, that many studies have on dreaming have shown that people, when they dream, they dream about people, they dream about dogs and cats, they dream about, you know, the, the amount of time they spend talking on the telephone or watching TV is actually similar to what it is in waking life. So dreaming is more like a selective simulation of the waking world. It's not that difficult to explain because your brain, from the moment you were born, your brain was learning to construct the world as a model of the environment. This is, this world is the only world that your brain knows how to build or should know how to build. And yet when you introduce this molecule, dimethyl tryptamine into the brain, the brain suddenly starts constructing a world it never learned to construct. It's like the brain is build, speaking a language it never learned to speak and doing so flawlessly. These worlds are of beautiful crystalline clarity, perfectly finessed, staggeringly complex narrative complexity that I think is very difficult to explain. There's no simple explanation of why the brain should, should, should suddenly become capable of constructing these worlds. Unless, unless, and this is where things become more contentious. We are indeed interfacing with some kind of intelligence. That's my, that's the explanation that makes sense to me is that somehow DMT is gating access to some kind of, that the flow of information from some kind of intelligent agent that is directing the DMT experience. So it's not a sensed world, it's not a kind of a dreamt world. It's actually a directed world. I always say you don't break through into the DMT world. The DMT world breaks through into you. It's like this intelligent agent has commandeered your neural machinery, the world building machinery of your brain and is is directing everything that you see. It has complete control.

It's interesting that you use the word construct rather than observe. So you're using, you're using terminology that seems to indicate that you believe that you're constructing reality. Yes. Not that you're just observing reality.

No, because it's not, if you think about perception in the same way of like looking like a video camera, just taking imagery, images of the world, that's not how it works. The brain must actively construct a model of of, of the environment. That's all what it's always doing. It's always constructing a model. And it is constantly using that model to make predictions about the way that kind of predictions about the, the evolution of sensory information. It's constantly saying, okay, if this is, if this model that I'm currently using is good, then this should happen next. This is the pattern of sensory information that I should receive next. So if I, for example, move this bottle of water across your, your perceptual field, even if you close your eyes, you could probably tell me where the water's gonna be in a couple of seconds because it's, it's moving. Your brain has a model of the water and it is using that to make predictions. And it's only when something surprising happens. You know, if the water, if I do this and your brain detects that there's something, its predictions start to fail and you get these error signals and these are what flow into the brain. And the brain uses then to kind of update its model until the errors decline. So you'll never, you never have direct access to the world or to the environment, should I say. You only have direct access to this model that your brain is constructing. Mm.

That's where it gets weird. Mm. Because I'm assuming your model and my model are very similar.

Right?

That would be if we could ever get to a ch a, a point where we could at least temporarily enter into someone else's consciousness and see how they see the world. Yeah. I think we're gonna get a lot of answers where we're gonna be like, oh, you guys live in a totally different fucking world. No wonder why you think we should be communists and we should, you

Know, like, well, it's true. Yeah.

I mean, every, whatever your chemical makeup is, your life experience, your biology, whatever contributing factors. I, I'm as I always assume that your construction of the world is the same as my construction of the world. But every now and then I'll get a text message from a friend about some world event. And their take is so crazy that I'll just go to go, wow, this person is living in a completely different world than me. I

Mean, they are, they are. I mean, yeah, I mean their, their brain, the structure of their brain, the organization of their neural networks and it's all different in everyone. Everyone has a unique brain. And so in a sense, everyone has to construct an entirely unique model of reality. But we agree on certain things. We reach this kind of consensus about what we call things. But we, you know, if I point at, you know, something that, that television Yeah, I can say that. Oh, there's, I can describe the colors, I can describe the people, but again, we're all using our own personally constructed model. Yeah. And that's what we experience.

Well that's what's weird, you know, 'cause we, again, it's just this assumption. So your, your take is that when you're dreaming, you are trying to construct this world and that you don't really have the tools to leave a book where you can read, you don't have the tools to use a calculator. You just know what a calculator is. And so if you're in, in the absence of an actual calculator, your brain's not capable of creating one.

Yeah. So, so, so again, you have at the, the highest level, you have a cal a calculator model, which is kind of a broad idea of a calculator. It doesn't have all the details. All the details are at the lower end. Actually we can show this can, sorry, Jamie, can I use Jamie like this? Sure.

Anytime.

Can you go to the picture of Margaret Thatcher? Yeah. The problem,

I was gonna bring this up in some way. I think it's supposed to play a video. Maybe

Not yet. Well,

The videos don't seem to be playing in the keynote. There's three or four of 'em and none of them play.

Oh really?

Yeah. I figured you were going to get here at some point.

Oh, okay.

I don't know how to, it's, it's just a,

Is it formatted for windows? No, no.

Let me go. Oh, go, go

Back. I didn't know that was gonna happen. Okay. Okay.

So perfect. Alright. Okay. So go back one. Okay. This is kind of really interesting, right?

Yeah. I've

Seen this. You've seen this, right? Yes. This

Is really not with Margaret Thatcher, but I've seen it with other faces.

Yeah. So the original was with Margaret Thatcher. Right.

Let's explaining to people that are just listening. 'cause it's still quite a lot of people. So this

Is called the Thatcher Effect. So when you are looking at this image of Margaret Thatcher or anyone, your brain is constructing a model of this person, right? A model of their, their face. And as I said, it's constructed over a hierarchy. So you have the overall idea, the overall concept of Margaret Thatcher, right? The whole face. Right. The whole thing. Right. And then you have a lower level, you have the eyes and the mouth and the nose, and they're kind of separate and then go going further still within the eyes. You've got circles and patches of color and all this stuff. And right at the bottom you have this really messy system of lines and things that don't make any sense. Right. And you can actually show how this hierarchy is constructed. At the moment it's, it just looks like Margaret Thatcher and it's, you can't really break it down. But if you flip over like this, so just leave it there for a second, Jamie, please. Yeah. So now you see what we've done is we've basically, we've weakened this highest level model right. Of the whole face. Because the brain isn't very good at building models of faces that are upside down. Right? Okay. And so this looks, there's something wrong with the image clearly,

But it looks like Margaret Thatcher. Absolutely.

It looks like Margaret Thatcher. But it's actually what's happened is the whole face has been flipped over, but the mouth and the eyes are actually the correct way up. Right? Right. But to the brain in this configuration, it's not that surprising because the eyes kind of look as they should. The mouth looks as it should.",,,"Andrew Gallimore, PhD, is a chemical pharmacologist and neurobiologist.

Right. You're seeing that lower level fragments. And it's only when you flip it that it becomes

Horrific.

Horrific. Right. So now you've reestablished that high level model of Margaret Thatcher and the brain goes, fuck, this is completely wrong. And this is why you get that, that it's immediately obvious with

The upside down eyes and the upside down mouth. It looks completely insane. She looks like a demon.

She looks like a demon, right?

Yeah. Which is really weird. Which

Is really weird. It's called the Thatcher effect.

It's So was she the original person that they used this idea? Exactly. That's why, who came up with this? Who?

Oh, good question. But this is fairly old now. I think at least a couple of decades old.

It's so funny that they figured that out. It's a, a great insight into how the mind works because the upside down Thatcher with the upside down with the correct eyeballs and mouth. The second one, Jamie, that does not look crazy at all. No, that's what's so weird about the third image. 'cause the third image really looked psychotic. Like if it was a monster movie Yeah. And then someone got bitten by a zombie and then that was what they looked like. And then they came running after you and be like, oh fuck she got bit. Yeah,

Exactly.

Her eyeballs are upside down. Her mouth is upside down. 'cause that's what it looks like. Yeah. Weird. Like the, for people listening, the big teeth, you're above teeth. They're, they're below and the little tiny teeth are above and the eyeballs are the eyelids, the top part are on the bottom and it really looks like a monster. Yeah. And it's weird that it looks like a monster 'cause it looks so damn normal. Upside down. Yeah,

Exactly.

Weird.

So yeah, it's just, it's, it's, it's revealing this hierarchy, this structure of, of this world model that your brain is always constructing. You see,

That's a good way to describe why it's constructing rather than observing. Right. That's clearly an am example of your constructing normalcy and that upside down face. It's not normal at all. It's not normal

At all.

Right? Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. So do we know what's going on when you're dreaming? Is it potentially, is there a release of DMT? 'cause DMT is exogenously, it's produced in the brain, it's produced in the liver and the lungs. Right. It's produced, produced a lot of other areas. So we know the body makes it right. Yeah. And we also know that melatonin plays a role and there's a lot of other things going on. Is it possible that DMT is one of the ingredients in the soup?

Well, so I think the problem is, as I said, is that yes, it's possible biochemically now the pineal gland is what people often refer to, right? Because the pineal gland has this long history and mystical traditions, the seat of the soul, the third eye, all this kind of stuff. So everyone wants DMT to produce to be produced by the pineal gland. Yeah. The problem is, is first of all is that the pineal gland is very small. It's about the size of the end of my, my pinky. And it's designed or evolved to produce nanograms micrograms of melatonin. Very small amounts you need. So the idea that this gland can suddenly start pumping out milligrams of DMT to achieve a kind of psychedelic state in the dream state is, is quite an ask. There have, there have been some studies, or one study in particular actually looked at DMT level. So we've known since the 1950s that DMT is produced by is a product of mammalian physiology and it's produced by humans. In, in those days, they tried to kind of pin schizophrenia on DMT. Right? The idea that if there was some fault, some problem with tryptamine metabolism, instead of producing serotonin, which is five hydroxy tryptamine, the brain could instead start producing elevated levels of an end dimethyl tryptamine or DMT. And so they started looking for differences in DMT levels in psychotic patients, schizophrenic patients versus normal people. And there've been more than a hundred studies that have looked at levels of DMT and the, in the blood, in urine, in cerebral spinal fluid. But there's, there's no convincing consistent evidence that suggests that DMT is the cause Right. Of psychosis or dreaming, in fact,

Can I, in endogenous production? Yeah. What, what are the, what's the mechanism? Like what is producing it?

Okay, so it's actually produced from tryptophan. So DMT is an alkaloid, and alkaloids are all produced from amino acids. So tryptophan is first converted to tryptamine. This is called de decarboxylation. You remove a carbon dioxide molecule and you've got tryptamine. Now here you can go in a number of different directions. You can go to serotonin, which is five hydroxy tomine, or you can go to DMT. You just simply add to methyl groups, to carbon atoms. And

So what is adding these things?

So there's an enzyme called indole, eth lamine and methyl transferase or INMT for short. This is the key enzyme for DMT production. It adds these two groups, these methyl groups to tryptamine, which is produced from tryptophan to produced DMT and

Tryptophan is produced from.

So it's tryptophan is one of the essential amino acids. So it's, it is something you consume.

Do you, do people take tryptophan as a dietary supplement in order to increase the potency of their experiences?

Some people do. I don't think it would have an appreciable effect. Okay. I mean, people take tryptophan for, for, for lots of reasons.

So this process, what makes you think that this is a size dependent process? Because if, just because this gland is so tiny, why can't it do it?

Okay. Well there's a number of things. First of all, it's, it's, it's just, there's orders of magnitude. I mean, a gland that is designed to produce nanograms or micrograms of something or ask it to produce a thousand times more of an entirely different molecule is quite an ask. However, that's not the only reason that there's actually been a study recently in the last, I think three or four years that looked at DMT levels in rat brains in real time. They're not in humans, but in rat brains, they actually have a technique now called microdialysis where they can basically measure in awake an awake moving, you know, normally behaving rat. They can measure the levels of DMT in its brain. And what they found was that the levels of DMT, first of all were surprisingly high. So similar levels to things like serotonin and dopamine, which

Is unusual,

Which is yes. Which makes you think that it must have some kind of function. But importantly, they also, in some rats, they remove the pineal gland. They kind of cut it out and found that it didn't affect. So we don't need the pineal. In other words, all brain cells, all neurons can probably produce DMT, the lungs can almost certainly produce DMT.

Why do you think that the pineal gland had this role in ancient mysticism? Why did they have this appreciation of it as being this very sacred organ? That, I mean is, I mean, it's the eye of Horace. Right? Right. I mean, certainly looks like it, it looked like the eye of Horace looks exactly like a cross section of the pineal gland.

Yeah. I mean, it sits right in the center of the brain as well. Right. So it, and it looks, it's kind of unusual, as you say, it looks like a little tiny pine

Curtain. Like how did they, where did they come up? It's whenever this, I mean, it's, it's very easy to dismiss Mm. Like ancient mysticism and ancient ideas of what, what things are sacred about, you know, the human body and what, what, what areas of the mind are producing these, the third eye, like that's how it was always described. But I, I don't want to, I I, it's too weird. So I, I I go wait a minute before you dismiss. 'cause it's fun to dismiss things like, oh, they didn't know anything. Like, how do we know that they weren't onto something? Like maybe there is a role that that plays in not normal DMT production, but in the big dump that you get before you die. Right. And then you have a near-death experience. Yeah. Maybe that has to be, maybe that's the kill switch. Maybe that's the big dump switch. You know what I mean? Like, if, like,

No one's ever put it like that before. Because if

You think about, it's the seat of the soul, right? If, if that is where the soul is like connected, that's where the soul is like anchored into this physical reality. And if you're gonna dive, you have a near-death experience. Something has gotta go, all right boys, this is not a drill. Let it go. And then, I mean, that's what a lot of people think is happening. They do. Yeah. Yeah. When people have near death experiences, there's a lot of very bizarre aspects of it. But one of 'em is the uniformity of their experiences. It's a lot of very similar experiences, very similar. You know, you have with anything, you have variables that people may or may not be adding onto their own, because people love to tell a good tale, you know? And why miss out on a chance when you've had a near death experience that was profound to maybe add a little to it, make it a little bit more exciting. But the overall kind of framework of the experience is very similar. And I often wonder like, what is that? Like I, I have a friend who was in a car accident and had a near death experience and said that when they came back, they had no fear. Like, for that moment, I think of fear now, but like, no fear at all about dying, no fear at all about life. And that this was this very weird transformative journey where they went to another place and then they returned. But it was very real. It felt very to the point where all of their anxiety, even about the car accident being knocked unconscious and all that stuff all went away.

Yeah. I think the, the, the near death experience connection to DMT is, is very interesting because Rick Strassman, of course, in the nineties when he wrote DMT, the spirit molecule, he hypothesized that in fact, the point of death DMT is released by the penile and it kind of acts as the conduit by which you, you the soul exits the body and enters the afterlife. Yeah. And of course that was, you know, largely speculation. It was just a hypothesis. But in recent years, there's been some really fascinating work showing that DMT actually, if you, if you take some neurons, a culture of neurons, for example, brain cells, which are very sensitive to oxygen levels. So if you deprive neurons of oxygen, they die very quickly. This is why strokes can be so rapidly devastating. If the brain becomes deprived of blood and oxygen, then the brain cells start to die. But in the presence of DMT, they live a lot longer. So they're kind of protecting the, the, the brain against hypoxia. Now, when does the brain enter a hypoxic state during the dying process, right? This is when as your cardiovascular system starts to collapse, your respiratory system collapses. The brain becomes deprived of oxygen. And this is precisely the time when you want the brain to be flooded with DMT, just in case you come back to protect the brain from the, the lack of oxygen. So that suggests a clear and obvious link. And if you kill rats, actually again, I was referring to this microdialysis experiment. If you kill a rat whilst measuring DMT levels, well as the rat dies, the DMT levels spike. Mm. So it suggests that the rat is also maybe having a

Tripping balls

An actual death experience. Yeah. I

Wonder if they come back as a person. Yeah. Come back to that.

But

It does suggest,

Right, it does suggest that there is maybe some link there, but what it doesn't explain of course, is, you know, why you would need, why this molecule would be, does why this molecule would be so profoundly visionary. Right? That's still a kind of a mystery, you know, are you gi being kind of given access to wherever you go right after death? You know, is is there a vision of, of, of, of what happens to you later on? That's

A but the question to me, my question rather is, but not it's, are we sure it's a vision or is it a gateway? Or is it, are you entering into a non-physical space that has its own laws that it's very different? But it is a reality, and it's not that it's a vision that, not that it's a hallucination or a visionary representation, or that you're even constructing this reality, but you're, you're entering into a completely different dimension that has laws that are very different than the dimension that we find ourselves in right now.

Okay. So what I think is that, I don't think with DMT that you are going anywhere as such. I think, You know, as I said, the the world you're experience is always represented in the brain. And that must apply I think in the DMT state. If you, if you're experiencing an altered world, there must be some repu representation of that within your cortical machinery, within your cortex, within your brain. I think that has to be the case. However, I don't think, and I think it's a, a great mystery is, is how the brain is actually capable of constructing that on its own in the same way that the brain constructs the dream world. Because the brain knows how to construct the waking world. So it's, it's simply using its stored models. The same with hallucinations. If you look at case reports of hallucinations in psychotics, you go through the psychiatric literature, the vast majority of hallucinations are normal appearing normal sized people, normal animals that it's like waking dreams, if you like. But with DMT, it's not your, the brain is somehow constructing a world that has no relationship whatsoever. Nothing is taken right from the normal waking world. It's like the brain is, is suddenly has switched to speaking a language that it never learned. And I think that suggests that actually what's happening is you're not going somewhere, but you are in this more kind of fluid and dynamic state that psychedelics induce. You are kind of, you are making the brain much more sensitive to being commandeered. I think it's a, an, I think what you're seeing is what this intelligent agent, as I recall, as I tend to call it, I don't call it spirits or aliens or anything like that. I think there's some, it's clear to me that there's some kind of intelligence and that intelligence is interacting with our brain in some way and, and showing us kind of what it wants us to see, if you like.",,,"Andrew Gallimore, PhD, is a chemical pharmacologist and neurobiologist.

Does that assume that consciousness resides in the brain though? Or is, I mean, when you take into account the possibility of consciousness being something that the brain tunes into and that it forms its own version of reality based on its biology, its life experiences, et cetera, et cetera, but that it is just a radio and it is just forming its version of consciousness, but that it, it is actually tuning into consciousness. And that consciousness is sort of a universal thing that exists not just in people, but maybe in other life forms as well. Certainly animals and maybe plants. So one of the weirder things about people who trip, I'm sure you know this, is they experience communication from plants. Like tree hugging becomes a real thing. Yeah, I know. Like tree hugging is a very different thing. It's like, oh, you're alive. Hello. You know, and we know that trees and plants in general, like especially house plants, when people interact with them, they grow better. They, they, they're healthier plants. Like you can prove it. It's interesting. You play music for them, communicate with them, say nice things. We also know that plants in like abusive households where people are alcoholics and cigarette smoke, they do, they're gonna do terrible.

Yeah. I think that as soon as I start talking about, first of all, I, I, I think consciousness is absolutely fundamental. I don't think that the brain generates consciousness. I think consciousness is in some way the only thing that really exists. You know, I think that it's the fun, it's the absolute ultimate reality is consciousness itself. Do

You think everything is conscious? I

Think everything is consciousness.

Everything is consciousness. Interesting. Yeah. Do you think there's a state that may be inanimate objects achieve that is very different than our interpretation of consciousness, but yet they're still conscious,

I think in, in, in,

Which is why, 'cause I say this 'cause Jamie has OJ Simpson's golf clubs. I feel like they have some consciousness attached to them.

I mean,

I mean it's probably bad, right? You know, those times

Yeah, you gotta watch out. I think, you know, what do we mean by when something's conscious in, in, in Buddhism they have this, they have this idea of things that exist from their own side, which I really like, you

Know, from their own side.

Yes. So you exist from your own side. In other words, Presumably, and I can never prove it, there is someone, a subjective perspective there that's actually modeling, you know, that it's experiencing in me. And I'm, and and Jamie as well. Everyone has is like a perspective, you know, I exist from my own side, right? Whereas does this skull exist from its own side? Is is, does it have its own unique perspective? I would say probably not, but I don't know. And right. Consciousness is kind of like the interaction, you know, reality kind of emerges by, by the interaction of all of these perspective, these conscious agents, if you like everyone, all these points of subjective perspective, I think that's probably closer to what ultimate reality is. But I think it's very difficult. You know, I'm a neuroscientist, so I focus on not consciousness per se, but on what I can get my teeth into. I can get my teeth into the content, into the structure, the actual meat and potatoes, right? Of never used that phrase before. That's a good phrase. The meat. Yeah. The meat and potatoes of the DMT experience. Things that I can talk about and analyze. That's, you know, I'm, what I'm trying to do, I think is, I'm, I'm not trying to tell people what I think DMT is. I'm just trying to convince them that it's not what they think it is. That it's not just hallucination, that it's not, these are not dreams. That kind of thing. I

Really feel like to be talking about the subject, you should experience it, like I said before, before. Oh, I agree. I think it's so silly that there's very serious people that are academics, that are brilliant people that are dancing around what this thing is without doing it.

Right.

I've never met anybody who's done it, who comes back and goes, eh,

Yeah, no, it's impossible to do No big

Deal.

I was, no, it's, it's, I was interacting with a guy on Twitter and Ex who referred to entity encounters as illusory social events, ISEs, which to me was just the most absurd watered down. I mean, this guy had obviously never encountered a fucking DMT entity or he wouldn't. But the idea that this is just an illusory social event just seemed to me absurd. And

Had he had any experiences,

I I, I very much doubt and he was from a neuroscientist.

But here's the thing, sometimes people have low dose experiences. Like I had talked to a friend once that had a very, I'm like, how many hits did you take? And they're like, one, I'm like, oh yeah, you need two more. You need two more. You need two more.

Take the third hit.

Yeah, you missed the gate. You didn't hit the gate. You're on the outside going, this place is kind of weird. Yeah, yeah. But if you go through, it's a lot weirder than you think.

It's a lot weirder than you think. Yeah. Yeah. Oh, it's, I think it's a lot weirder than Terence McKenna. Would you say you know, stranger than you can suppose?

I suppose.

Yeah.

He had a really amazing video that, I think I posted it on my Instagram of McKenna, like in the 1990s, I believe it was talking about the upcoming decades and what's going to happen in terms of how weird the world is going to be with technological innovation and what we're going to be seeing artificial intelligence, alien contacting, I mean, he basically nailed it. Yep. I mean, fucking nailed it. He nailed it to a t I think he might've predicted time travel, but here's the thing. If they are capable of time travel, when are you gonna find out about it? When are they gonna, if, if, let's say DARPA is working on some defense project and part of it involves like, you know, one way to stop a war would be literally to go back in time, five minutes and kill everybody who was about to start the war. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Right. You

Know, kill Hitler, that kind of

Idea. Yeah. Or, or stop a bomb from being switched on. You would literally go back in time and stop the bomb, stop the missiles from launching. Would you, when would we learn about that? When would, first of all, it very highly unlikely that it exists outside of the quantum stage right now. Right. I get it. But if it did, if we were talking about a hundred years from now, or 200, would we know we would not, do you want me to play it? Yes. This is it. This is it. This is amazing. I love this. First of all, I'd just love his voice. Had a guy in the best voice

And is going to rise excruciatingly even beyond the excruciating present levels of contradiction. So I think it's just going to get weirder and weirder and weirder. And finally, it's going to be so weird that people are going to have to talk about how weird it is. And at that point, novelty theory can come out of the woods because eventually people are gonna say, what the hell is going on? It's just too nuts. It's not enough to say it's nuts. You have to explain why it's so nuts. I look for the invention of artificial life. The cloning of human beings. Probably check a possible contact with extraterrestrial, probably check is possible human immortality. And at the same time, appalling acts of brutality, genocide, race, baiting, homophobia, famine, starvation. Because the systems which are in place to keep the world sane are in utterly inadequate to the forces that have been unleashed. The collapse of the socialist world, the rise of the internet, these are changes so immense. Nobody could imagine them ever happening. And now that they have happened, nobody even bothers to mention what a big deal it is. The mushroom said to me once, it said, this is what it's like when a species prepares to depart for the stars. You don't depart for the stars under calm and orderly conditions. It's a fire in a madhouse. And that's what we have the fire in the madhouse at the end of time. This is what it's like when a species prepares to move on to the next dimension. The entire destiny of all life on the planet is tied up in this. We are not acting for ourselves or from ourselves. We are, we happen to be the point species on a transformation that will affect every living organism on this planet at its conclusion.

Nailed it. I think that's exactly what's going on right now. The only thing that he didn't quite get is the artificial intelligence aspect. How much of a factor, but I mean, how could you predict all that in 1998?

I think with, you know, we, we live in a very thin sliver. If you look at the development of an intelligent civilization, right? Over hundreds of thousands of years, we live in this, this thin sliver, this kind of technological phase. And once you enter that phase that we are in now, you know, the computer aids, the information age or whatever it is, you are probably only a few hundred years away from Departing for the stars or something like this of complete or even completely transcending our biology. And this isn't a crazy idea anymore. You know, many sensible astrobiologists and other intelligence theorists think yes, probably what's going to happen in the next few hundred years is that we will become post biological. Yeah. And so if you think about the universe more broadly, if we are looking for aliens, quote unquote aliens as being kind of wet brained, wet bodied biological beings, we're probably only looking for a tiny fraction of the intelligence in the cosmos. And the vast majority of intelligence in the cosmos is likely to be post biological, to have completely dispensed with the biological form. Now what's interesting about that, Jamie, sorry, there's an, have you heard of, you've heard of the card chef scale, right? I don't think so. What is it? So the card chef scale was generated by a guy called card chef, and he was Soviet guy, and he kind of hype theorized of as intelligences progress and develop, they go through a number of phases. So you have a type zero. Okay, I have heard the scale. Yeah, you've got it. Right. So we are kind of a type zero level one on the Cardiff scale. And then level two, sorry, we're level zero. So level one would be when we, for example, are able to harness all of the energy from our neighboring star, then the next level when we can harness all the energy from the galaxy, et cetera. So it's, it's, it's an expansionist way of thinking about it. The idea of climbing the Cardish chef scale. There we go. You see? Yeah. But in the 1990s, a British cosmologist called John Barrow, he said, actually, if you actually look at how an intelligent civilization such as ourselves, the only one we know, we actually spend a lot more time going not to larger and larger scales, but smaller and smaller scales, right? We go down to, you know, doing chemistry, the large Hadron Collider, we're looking at the structure of atoms, and then the, the structure of subatomic particles and that kind of thing. We're actually spending more time and more energy and more money going deeper and deeper. Now, the reason that's significant is because if you take the, the human sits in the middle, if you take the scale of a human, and then you compare the scale of a human to the scale, let's say the hydrogen atom, and then you compare it to the scale of the observable, observable universe, humans sit almost exactly in the middle of that scale from the hydrogen atom to the observable universe. But below the hydrogen atom, there is probably a hundred million to a billion times more scale, deeper and deeper down. Richard Feynman, the Nobel, you know, the legendary physicist always used to say, there's, there's plenty of room at the bottom. There's much more room at the bottom. In other words, as an intelligent species, an intelligent civilization progresses, they're not likely to kind of become space fairing as such, you know, and kind of exploring the cosmos. They're much more likely to go deep down and kind of instant instantiate themselves at the lowest levels of reality. That's where all the space is. It's not out there, surprisingly, all the space is downwards. Now, once an intelligence achieves that, and you have to imagine that probably there are probably billions of these civilizations that had had already achieved this before we even popped into existence, before we, you know, evolved as a species, they would effectively disappear. They would, they would become effectively part of the fabric of, of space time itself exploiting the fundamental computational structure of the lowest level of, of reality, basically. And that's where they reside.",,,"Andrew Gallimore, PhD, is a chemical pharmacologist and neurobiologist.

"ist always used to say, there's, there's plenty of room at the bottom. There's much more room at the bottom.

They would, they would become effectively part of the fabric of, of space time itself exploiting the fundamental computational structure of the lowest level of, of reality, basically. And that's where they reside. And there are probably far, far more, probably millions or billions more of those types of civilizations than there are ones, like I say, you and me, like us as humans, right? And so then you ask, well, if that's the case, you know, if we are interested in contacting, so quote unquote extraterrestrials, why are we focused on this tiny subpopulation of beings that are likely to be, you know, floating around in metallic discs or whatever. We should in fact be focusing on the, the much more abundant ones that are perhaps at the deepest levels of reality. And how would we do that? How would an intelligence that has completely transcended its biology and even completely transcended its physical form entirely? How would such an intelligence communicate with us? It would do it through our brain. That's the most obvious thing. Because the brain is how we interact with the environment. It's how we interact. It's the interface by which we interact with what there is. And I think DMT I'm not saying that these DMT entities are necessarily these post biological beings, but it's not out of the question. I'm not straying too far from fairly standard now modern scientific discourse. When I say that it's perfectly possible that there are very large numbers of these supremely intelligent civilizations that are everywhere and nowhere, and that we can somehow interact with using our brain. And that DMT generates this kind of highly susceptible, highly sensitive neurological state that allows us to interact with them. This is why perhaps when you go into the DMT space, it's immediately obvious, it's undeniable, undeniably apparent that you are interacting with some kind of supremely advanced intelligence. Could that be some intelligence that has existed long before we arrived on the sea? And that we are now kind of discovering this technology and I, I consider DMTT to be some kind of technology that we have discovered that we are now learning to use to interact with these intelligent agents that perhaps have been here for forever in human terms.

The, it's an interesting term, the term go there. Mm. You know, because that's what it feels like. Yeah. It feels like you're, you're traveling somewhere, like you're going somewhere. But the reality is that place that you're going is probably right here. Yes. That's where it gets weird because it's around you all the time. You just don't have the ability to tune into it all the time because you wouldn't be able to function if you did.

Exactly. And, and these beings, they probably don't even have a true form that you could represent visually. Right. Right. So when you see an insectoid alien or a machine now, you're probably not seeing, or almost certainly, I've

Never seen a machine now. Oh, really? Have you?

I've seen, I dunno if I've seen the, the archetypal kind of McKenna McKenna of McKenna

Machine out. Yeah. The way you described it was very odd. But

I've seen certainly a multitude of beings. Very, very kind of srey squeaky. Yeah. Like jabbering, jabbering.

You know, I saw once a bunch of jokers giving me the finger, ah, they were all giving me the finger, and they're going, fuck you. And they were jokers with like little tassels on with the bells in the end of it. Right. And it made me very aware that I was taking myself too seriously. And they were like, yep, yep. And they said it to me and they pointed their finger at me like that. I was like, you're right. Yeah.

It's interesting, actually, it reminded me of something. There's this weird effect that people who, who use DMTA lot, they get this, you know, they might use DMT regularly and, and, and one day they, they take a hit as they normally do with the same batch of DMT, and they get a joker or a jester, and it wags its finger and says, not today, you've

Done too much.

Yep, exactly. I've heard that before. Yeah. And it shuts off. A guy wrote to me and says that he, he saw a jester, as he often does, and it fucking punched him in the face. And he felt it, he felt, and it knocked him back into this world. And so the, the effect was gone. Oh, wow. Instantaneously. Now that is not easy to explain because it, this is not tolerance. DMT first of all doesn't exhibit subjective tolerance, unlike the other psychedelics. It's kind of weird. You can inject someone with DMT every 30 minutes perpetually, and they will, the intensity of their experience will always be the same. Yeah. It's not a tolerance and tolerance anyway, is a gradual thing. It increases gradually over time. Right. So it's not an off switch. I was speaking to someone, we, we are probably gonna talk about DMTX later, which is kind of my thing. But she was undergoing DMTX, which is this infusion where they, they keep the brain level of DMT constant and she, that's

A tease to the big buildup Yes. Of DMTX. There

We go. Yeah. And she was in the DMT space interacting, the infusion machine was running, pumping her brain with DMT at constant rate, keeping the DMT levels in her brain constant. And she's interacting with these entities. And then at some point after maybe, you know, 30 minutes or whatever, when the machine was still running, they said to her, or impressed upon her, they said, okay, we we're done, we're done today. And the visions stopped. Whoa. But the machine, the brain was still being pumped with DMT, and yet the visions stopped. So what that suggests to me is that they do, indeed, as I said before, they have control. They are directing the information into the brain. And people, you know, described things like downloads in Graham Hancock. Actually, in, in his book Supernatural, in his first DMT experience, he described this, this download of highly complex, entirely non-human information into his brain as if he locked in to some kind of advanced computational processor that was, that was beaming information into his, his brain. And many people described that as like a download and of, of, of, of complex mathematical structures and strains, geometries, entirely, entirely non-human stuff. As if there's kind of, not that they expect you to understand it, but as if to say, you know, we know a lot more about reality than you do. We know a lot and you don't know anything. And that's the message they're kind of trying to impress upon you by directing it. And they can control it. They can, they can shut it off if they so, so decide.

Picked up on the day.

Yeah. It's a weird one. Whatever it is. Whatever it is. Yeah. This idea that we all evolve along a similar pathway is strange to me that the concept is we assume that intelligent life everywhere else evolves along similar pathways. And that most of them eventually become some sort of a biological digital hybrid, if not completely digital. And then most of them probably figure out how to harness the power of the star and the suns. But one of the, the weird thing about us is that not just that we are evolving and that we have evolved, but yet we have this, but that rather we have this insatiable desire for technological innovation. Technological innovation, and to make things better. We're constantly improving upon everything we make. We're making better versions of every computer, every phone, every year. Even though it's not really necessary for most people, you're always buying them. It, it's a very strange desire that we have that I think sinks hand in glove to materialism. Because materialism is also still so stupid for an intelligent life form that has a finite lifespan to not be aware that collecting things does you no good 'cause you're gonna die. Like, but yet you want to collect things more than anything. And you wanna show people the things you've collected. Well, what better way to facilitate innovation and growth than to have a built in instinct for purchasing better things all the time and possessing better things all the time, which will force people to work literally into the grave Yeah. In order to get these things done.

Yeah. I think it's, it's psychotic. Yeah,

It is. But that, that's just us. Yeah. Like, it doesn't have to be like that. If you think about the hundreds of billions of stars just in this galaxy, the hundreds of billions of galaxies in the known universe, the, the endless possibilities of when intelligent life emerged, if in fact it did emerge anywhere, we have no evidence it emerged anywhere else but here. Right. We're just guessing. Mm. We assume. But if we were right, like it could have taken infinite number of forms, it could have evolved completely non-physical. Yeah. Like intelligent life that's completely non-physical. That's not, it's not contained to a cellular structure and bones and organs that it's plasma based. That it's some sort of in, in intelligence that communicates with some sort of a universal language. We, we don't, we're just guessing that everything's a monkey. We're just guessing. Everything's a curious monkey that keeps making a better spaceship. Yeah. Yeah. But that mind it be true. Which by the way, I went to the SpaceX, Jamie and I both did How dope. Sick. Pretty dope. We went to see the SpaceX launch. We were How far do you think we were? Were we a half a mile? Quarter of a mile? What do you think

I call it a mile. A mile and a

Half. Maybe two miles. Oh, you think a mile More than a mile. Yeah. Really? Okay. Could have been. So let's say we're a mile away. Let's just guess. Well, let's just throw it in perplexity. I guess I can look. Throw it in perplexity. Ask our sponsor Perplexity. How far is the distance between Star base and the SpaceX rocket

Between the star base

And the SpaceX Launchpad? Yeah, launchpad,

SpaceX and Texas. Just to be specific.

Yeah. Because there's one in Florida as well. So they have their own town down there. It's like a legit town. It's like a military town. Like they took over a place like a, a military installation. These little tiny houses, fucking security everywhere. There's so many cyber trucks. If you have a cyber truck, you're fucked. You can't Fair enough. You have no idea. You better remember your parking spot.

Bitch.

Everybody has a goddamn cyber truck.

I estimated at less than one

Mile. See Okay. Right here. Okay. Main interest star base of the actual launch pad infrastructure. Estimated less than one mile public viewing sites. Okay. There's public viewing sites. Yeah. But we were there, we were at Star base, we were in a, like a public viewing site. We were at the actual rocket factory. And when that thing takes off, you feel it in your chest, it's nuts. So it's roughly a mile away and you have to wear earplugs. It's a mile away. Yeah. And you gotta wear earplugs and you feel it in your chest. And Elon's son was like, I wanna go home.

Like,

There was a video, there's a video that I put and you could hear 'em in the background. It's so funny because my wife was like, were the babies Okay. 'cause women that have children, like they, they, that's the immediately what they go to. Not. Wow. That rocket's really cool. It's like, oh, are the baby's okay? Because she could hear 'em going, I wanna go, I wanna go. He was like, I wanna get outta here. Because it's that freaky, the power of it is just so nuts you that you feel, and then you see it and you realize like, God, how many people have seen a rocket launch? Like how crazy this thing's going into space. And then I went upstairs and I got to sit in the command console, or whatever you would call it, the command center. And I get with me and Elon and all the engineers, and we get to watch it land in Australia 35 minutes later. So we watch

35 minutes Yes.

From, yes, from from Texas, from Texas to Australia. Wow. It's crazy. And we're watching all these cameras in real time that are all connected to starlink satellites. So there's dozens of cameras. So you're watching about two miles is what this is. Oh, two miles straight across. Okay. It seems so close. It seemed really close. Okay. Two, even crazier. So two miles away in you feel it in your chest. It's nuts. I mean, it's really nuts. It's the power that it has is so nuts. But it's so old school, right? Yeah. It's just,

You know, it feels old fashioned in a weird kind of way.

It's the most modern version of like a V eight muscle car.

It's crazy. Right. If you think like a hundred years ago, at the end of the beginning of the 20th century, how different we would be in a hundred years as, you know, as we are now, it's, it's unfathomable. When you compare The rest of human history, it's, it's, it's like an exponential thing. You know, we, we've gradually been developing and technologically improving. And then we hit some point in the last century where we reach this kind of technological computer informational age, and everything is accelerating Exactly like Terrence McKenna was saying. Yes. Things speed up Right. Very, very quickly. And it feels like we're on the cusp either of killing ourselves, which is one option. Right. Or undergoing some profound transformation as a species, whether it be, whether it means becoming a spacefaring nation, sorry, a spacefaring civilization, or whether it means going in the opposite direction and becoming some kind of post biological civilization that exists beyond space and beyond time perhaps. And kind of joining the crowd of these intelligences that have made that transition perhaps billions of years ago.",,,"Andrew Gallimore, PhD, is a chemical pharmacologist and neurobiologist.

You think that this chaos is the only way that things get done? See, this is, this is my my thought. If everybody, everything's perfect and everything's wonderful and fine, there's very little motivation for radical change. And radical change is what you need to escape the primate instincts that we have. Yeah. As McKenna had the great quote of that, we're territorial apes with thermonuclear weapons. There we go. Yeah. It's such a perfect way to describe us. That is what we are. Right? So in order to escape that, things have to almost be so ca chaotic that it demands radical change. It, it demands, like you're, we were literally like, and this is how we look at many things. We, even things that aren't totally warranted, like climate change or COVID or anything. Like, we look at it like, oh my God, it's an existential crisis. Like, we have to do something right now. And this is how also we approach political dissent or political disagreements. If the left wing wins, the world is over. If the right wins, the world is over. And it's like this, like, it's almost like this is how we have to function in order to really get things done. And as things are getting more and more crazy in, in terms of technology and in terms of the consequences, consequences of our actions post nuclear bomb, post fusion, post HydroOne collider, post AI is where it gets really weird. We have to kind of be like, we, we really gotta get going guys. Yeah. We really gotta do something and we have to figure out what's the right way to proceed in order to not blow ourselves up. Yeah. Like how, and I feel like this is maybe the only way that you motivate this kind of extreme change, which seems like our destiny, our destiny is some sort of a very bizarre extreme change. Mm. That seems to probably be happening within your, your and my lifetime. Something's happening right now that is gonna be different than anything that's ever happened before, which is the birth of artificial general super intelligence right in front of our eyes. Some sort of a digital supreme being is going to exist. And we're gonna, we're we're gonna have to figure out society. We're gonna have to figure out everything. It's gonna be a complete, this idea of like having bullshit congressional candidates that are full of shit and paid off by these companies. And they're gonna make laws that screw you over and get all that's out the window when no humans control anything anymore. And that's entirely possible inside of our lifetime. And I think more likely than not, because if you look at all the harm we've done to the rivers and the ocean and the world and all the stupid shit we do on a daily basis, if artificial intelligence comes along and says, all of this is completely unnecessary, just let us take the reins and we'll solve all of your energy problems, all of your inequality problems, all of your famine, we're gonna solve it all very quickly and we're gonna stop all wars. You'd have to be a fool to say, no, I value freedom more than I fear nuclear war. There'll probably some fat, sweaty right wing guy who's on TV with an American flag and his lapel, and he'll tell you that. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Freedom is more info. We have gotten to 2025 because of free. He like Alex Jones. Alex Jones is right about most things. I feel like maybe that's the only way things get done is through chaos like that. We have to have a motivat Like what is the best motivation for success? I think it's poverty. When you, when you grow up poor, you people that grow up poor have an extra gear. Mm. They get things done. Like as terms of like athletes. Certainly in terms of fighters, I would, I would say the vast majority of elite MMA fighters had a bad childhood. Not all of them. There's a lot of really great guys and really great fighters that have wonderful parents, and they just love competition and they just have it in them. Hmm. But that's, that's the outlier. Hmm. Really, the, the common one is someone who was beaten up a lot as a child, gangs beaten into gangs, like been around violence a lot, had older brother, maybe abusive fathers. That's a big one. And those people because of that, have a motivation to do something that other people don't. They can push harder, they can f they can solve complex combat sports problems that other people don't solve as quickly. I wonder if that's the case with everything. But like, in order to really get things done, like you have to have a chaotic society that would e even accept ai. Hmm. Like in order for AI to, if we were a, some peaceful Buddhist civilization that was living completely in harmony with the earth, with regenerative farming everywhere, no use of plastics. All fossil fuels are either eliminated or reduced down to some sort of bioavailable recyclable material that we then, you know, put back into the mulch or whatever the fuck we do. And then someone came along and said, we're gonna develop artificial intelligence and these nerds in Simi Valley are gonna control it. You'd be like, what? What are you talking about?

Yeah. I think,

I mean, we're gonna have some Silicone Valley guys with autism and they're gonna be the ones that are in charge of the destiny of the human race. 'cause they're gonna create a digital God. You'd be like, no, no. Slow down. Hold on. Yeah. But if you're in a place where you look at Gaza's getting destroyed and you see what's going on in Ukraine, they're putting 60-year-old guys on the front line and Russia, and they're using drone bombs with monofilament line behind them because they, they don't want anti drone technologies. They come up with new ways to kill each other. Like maybe AI is the solution because it's so crazy. Everything's so nuts. You look at India and those rivers that are completely choked with plastic, plastic bottles and garbage. And you look at China, the places where they make blue jeans, where the entire river's blue from our stupid fucking jeans that they manufacture for us. And you go, wow. Like maybe it kind of has to be this, maybe we have to, in order to accept the fact that we need help, maybe we have to fuck it up first. Maybe we have to fuck it up so bad on our own that if we didn't fuck it up, we would never have the need for it. We'd be like, well, as a person, my goal in life is to achieve enlightenment and to be a better version of me. And that's not having something that's digital, that has no emotions and feelings and no empathy whatsoever unless I program it into it. Like have that have supreme control over all the available resources on earth. Yeah. I'm gonna pass on that. Yeah, that sounds like a bad idea.

I mean, I think that that generally, there's a, there's a, a fundamental principle that the most interesting things happen at the edge of chaos. Right. You know, and this applies, it applies to the brain. The brain actually sits at the edge of chaos. You know, it's complex systems. We have lots of interacting parts. They can, they can, they can display behavior from perfect order all the way to complete chaos. Now, perfect order is boring, nothing happens. Complete chaos is useless because it's, it's, it's, it's not actually technically random, but it, it's complete, it's a complete mess. Whereas when you get that balance right, you reach a point that's called the edge of chaos where order and disorder are perfectly balanced psychedelics. They, they, as I said before, they nudge the brain into that slightly disordered state. But all things, all cells, all living organisms, complex society and societies, they operate at the edge of chaos. So I think what you're saying kind of resonates with that idea that that interesting things happen globally within civilizations, not when everything is perfect. Right. But when things are have, are close to going out of control. Yeah. But they don't, and you, you have to push it as far as you can push it without it descending it. We, we we're always on the edge of everything collapsing. And we are probably closer to that than we, we, we actually realize. Right. And so I think that's kind of what happening. And I think with, when it comes to super intelligence, there's an interesting idea which I've been playing with, is, well, if, if there is some kind of super intelligence that does emerge, and that might be the fate of all intelligence civilizations, the astrobiologist, Steven Dick conceived of something called the intelligence principle, which basically says that any civilization will try to maximize intelligence. Because when you maximize intelligence, you improve education, you improve technology, everything improves. And, and ultimately the intelligence that the civilization have leads to the generation of super intelligences. You know, the artificial intelligences that we have now that then become super intelligences. And of course the super intelligence isn't going to be kind of running on the kind of transistor architectures that we are familiar with. A super intelligence will find a way to instantiate itself using the, the fundamental computational substrate of space time itself. That's where it's gonna learn how to go. And that might be the fate is that this super intelligence, when it emerges in on earth, it instantiates itself into the fundamental substrate of reality. Perhaps usurps us or swallows us up, or maybe just destroys us. And then that becomes part of the, that vast population of, of super intelligence is that permeate the cosmos. And that might be what we're interacting with when you smoke DMT is you're interacting with one of these superintelligent, which would explain why it seems so technological and so inorganic. Right. The, the DMT space, it's like you are interacting not with other living beings like us, but you're interacting with what seems to be thoroughly alien intelligences. And, and, and that could be what's where we are heading. I dunno whether that's a, a good thing or a bad thing. Whether we are gonna merge with this super intelligence in some way, and that's our ultimate destiny, or whether it's simply gonna destroy us and be, we're just gonna be lost. We are basically, we're kind of like the tools that the intelligence is used is to create new versions. So for super intelligence,

Well that's, that's the theory that a lot of people have in terms of like why human beings exist in the first place that human beings exist. Because we're designed to work really hard until we develop artificial life. And then artificial life takes it from here. Yeah. Like, we got it. You guys are so flawed. Yeah. And then it also coincides with a drop in sperm count, drop in fertility rates for women, increase in miscarriages, microplastics in the, in everybody's body and their diet that disrupt the endocrine system and keep you from reproducing is, is as easily all those things are happening simultaneously. Yeah. And it's quite fascinating. I mean, you would look, if you thought of it as a pattern, you'd be like, oh, it's happening right now. Yeah. Look, there's this dip in testosterone. This, this rise in miscarriages, this fertility rate issue, chaos at the border. All this stuff is happening at the same time. Yep. It's all happening while this artificial life is being generated. Yep. And may already exist. It might already be here because it hasn't announced itself. Yeah. I mean, there's such a minimal understanding of how these things even work. It might exist, but is still reliant upon a power source that's insufficient for its needs. Got it. You know, because that's the thing about it, right? Mic Kaku was talking about this and, and also Avi Loeb was actually talking about this the other night. The amount of power that the human mind uses to make computations is so minimal in comparison to the amount of power that these data centers need to run ai. It's kind of extraordinary. And Avi Loe was pointing out the other day that they're, they're building nuclear power plants specifically to fuel these AI centers that they're creating, which is really not, I think Google has one AI built one AI project where they're building three separate nuclear power plants to power this one AI data center. What does, what does that mean? Like how much, that's the thing that the people don't understand about AI itself is the power demands are insane. Yeah. And if everything goes artificial general super intelligence with this grid that we have right now, this grid sucks. This grid is designed for toasters and recharging your cell phone. It's not designed to power AI centers. And so the, it might already be here, but it might be like, you guys gotta figure out power before we announce ourselves.

Yeah. I, I, and I think that eventually it will, it will discover or learn how to instantiate itself without requiring this massive, I mean, obviously as you said, the brain is, is able to perform massive parallel computations, you know, obviously with very little energy. And so eventually this art artificial intelligence will discover the means of instantiating itself without requiring that. And I think that's where we start looking downwards. That's where we start looking deep down.

The lowest levels. That's where it's going. It's gonna zero

Point energy. Yeah. Yeah. I mean this is the theory about aliens or UAPs, like how they travel here. That they're, they're using something that's, I mean, the Elon stuff, the SpaceX stuff is so impressive, but so old school and that what they have done is figured out a way to use all the power and power that's around you all the time. And Hal Puthoff talks about this, he talks about the concept of them harnessing zero point energy. And this is also something that Bob Azar referred to when he was working, allegedly on those back engineering of UFOs at area 51, site four. He was saying that they essentially are creating a void of gravity and pushing their folding space essentially. Or they're like, the way he described it, it's as if you took a really heavy object like a bowling ball and you put it in a soft cushion like a mattress. It sinks in there and that that's what it would do to space time, that it would essentially cause this bubble and put you in another place. Mm. So instead of pushing yourself there with jet fuel that's burning Yeah. You just get sucked there and almost instantaneously. And so what we're thinking of is, you know, amazing rocket travel is super old school. Yeah. And ama, I mean, amazing rocket travel. If you showed that to people a thousand years ago, you'd be like, what the fuck is that? That's insane. And to, to us it's just cool. Or cell phones, which is even probably more impressive. Show a cell phone to someone, it's just 200 years ago and they'd be like, this is sorcery. Like this is absolutely insane that you're able to, so we could imagine a world 200 years from now where gravity travel is completely normal, where they've harnessed this and they've figured out how to make a stable version of element one 15 or whatever it is. You know, this is his idea that he said they were trying to back engineer from these alleged crafts was that they had this stable element of one 15 that they bombarded with radiation and it creates this sort of gravity hole and that they can use this and aim it and propel this craft to various places with that.

Yeah. I think, are you familiar with John Mack? Yes.

Yeah.

And I think, you know, when we talk about aliens, how you are kind of describing it, this is, I think how most people actually think about aliens is, as I said, is these beings that are, that are very, very much physical and, and the abduction phenomenon that John Mack, of course, I mean John Mack was, as you might be aware, I mean, he was the top of his game. You know, I mean, this guy was the head of the Harvard School of Psychiatry or something like this. Yeah. So when he, you know, first heard about people being abducted, I mean, he assumed that they were just hallucinating. Carl Sagan famously told Mack that UMES were just hallucinating. And John Mack said, you know, what the fuck do you know about hallucinations? Because John Mack knew a lot about hallucinations and he knew that this wasn't easy to explain. It wasn't ex ex, you know, people were describing the same kinds of experiences. People who have no interaction with each other were describing exactly the same scenario. Are

You familiar with Jacques Val's work? Yes. So Jacques Vallee, one of the more interesting things about some, I've read four or five of his books now, or listened to four or five of his books now. But one of the more interesting things is when he gets into historical accounts and that these historical accounts with they, there's no way they could have somehow or another been sharing information. But they're the same. They're very, very, very similar. Right. Within a realm, within a, a range of not having the vocabulary to be able to adequately describe something completely novel and alien to another person. Yeah. Within that range, when you take into account the similarities that they're describing, they're very similar in the 17 hundreds, in the 18 hundreds all the way up to Betty and Barney Hill. When, when that one, which we became probably the most popular of all time, but one of the most famous ones. Yeah, for sure. That one was just like all these stories from the 17 hundreds, which is really weird.

Yes, it is. And I think what you are seeing is the same phenomenon that of, as you say, is obviously how you describe it, is influenced by your worldview. You see the same thing with, with DMT. So there, there's a tribe called the, the AMI in, in the Amazon and a very large indigenous group. And they describe beings when they, they take these plant-based preparations that contain DMT YoPo is probably the most well known. It's like a snuff. Have you heard of YoPo?

I've heard of it through McKenna that they, they blow it up each other's nose. Yeah. Like,

Yeah, yeah. Like that.

It's supposed to be horrible. It's

Horrible. But when they take it, they de they describe seeing these beings, tiny beings that are lively, they're affable, they're colorful, they operate in great numbers. They're dancing and singing. And these sound like elves. They sound like elves. Right? Yeah. When, when DMT was first injected in a human pure DMT in, in the 1950s by a Hungarian physician called Steven Zara, he was the one who discovered the psychedelic properties of pure DMT, one of his first subjects described, seeing small beings that moved around very, very quickly. And the Yami, they also have these beings they call wadi, which are like insect beings, which are kind of fearsome. So again, you're seeing the same kinds of beings that people now describe being operated upon. Yes. By highly advanced maned. Yeah.

Like beings. They're the scariest ones apparently.

They're the scariest ones. Yeah. Or certainly one of them. And then when you look at John Max reports of abductions, again, they often describe the same types of beings. They describe going to a world that is higher dimensional, that seems to subsume this reality. And many of the reports, there's one report in his first book abduction, John Max's first book about the abduction experience anyway, where one of his subjects describes these small, lively beings that bound around, I mean, bound around. That's a macken of race. He talks about the elves bounding into the room. And so I think there is clearly some connection there. Right. It's, it's, we're not talking about, I don't think the abduction experience is, is kind of separate from the DMT experience. They're different aspects of an, an ancient phenomenon, which is humans interacting with normally invisible unseen beings. Advanced intelligence, right. Nonhuman intelligences. And how that manifests varies. But ultimately, I think it's the same thing. Now, of course in the past they might describe them as spirits. We might describe them as, you know, non-human intelligence or discon entities or intelligent agents or post biological aliens. It doesn't matter what we call them. I think it's the same phenomenon. And we've spent our life, so kind of the entire history of human development, this phenomenon has been occurring. And, and in the Amazon rainforest, they develop these tools, these technologies. Ayahuasca is a technology, it's not just a mixture of plants. It is a true pharmacological technology that they use to, as kind of visual prosthesis is one anthropologist calls it that allows them to, to to, to see and interact with and develop long-term relationships, so to speak, with these otherwise invisible, hidden ones. And now in the 21st century, we've got perhaps the, the ideal tool, which is actually pure DMT itself. And we're kind of learning how to use that now in our own kind of, with our own kind of modern twist. If you'll

Yeah. I wonder what the relationship is between the DMT state and this alien abduction phenomenon. And not just abduction, but encounter, you know, because there are, there're all, there aren't, they aren't all abduction experiences. A lot of them are just encounters. And that, you know, maybe if you wanted to think about the role that human beings have on this planet, we perhaps we're an intelligence farm. And that like any good farm, like if you are a farmer and let's say you're a sheep herder, you're raising sheep, well you have to keep, make sure the wools stay out. So you have to have sheep dogs and make sure they have good grass to grow on. And then eventually you'll get a nice crop of sheep and then you get some wool out of that. Yeah. And you get some meat out of that. And that's the whole purpose of the whole thing. Maybe that's the reason why we exist in the first place, is that we're here to farm intelligence. And that what we're doing biologically what we are biologically is just a kind of a crude, clunky, shitty patch together version of these territorial apes with thermonuclear weapons that have figured out a way to make something far superior than itself. And that's what our goal was all along. I always talk about us, I say that we're, we're some sort of a biological, like we're we, we're like a caterpillar and we're making a cocoon. We don't know why, but we're gonna turn into this technological butterfly. But I think Marshall McLuhan even said it better than me. He said, human beings are the sex organs of the machine world.

Woo.

How great is that? That's a great, great quote.

Yeah. I think, You know, with as regards the connection between the abduction phenomenon and, and the DMT state, for example, I, I think the DMT state, as I said, is when the DMT state creates this neurological state where this intelligence can interact with our brain directly. And I think that the abduction, you know, John Mack, towards the end later on at least, he, he left behind the kind of the nuts and bolts idea that we were talking about. Physical beings that were landing on the lawn, sneaking in through the window and plucking people from their beds. But actually that, that, that the intelligences might well be entirely non-physical, but we're interacting with their brain in the same way I think is happening with DMT. That they are interacting directly and inducing them effectively into this altered state and directed them to some end, I dunno what the purpose is, directed them into their, you know, a vision of their reality or, or for some other purpose. I'm not sure. But I think it's, it's, it's a, it's all about interaction between your brain. I think

Maybe being abducted and being taken aboard a physical object and examined is easier to handle than what's really going on.

Oh yeah.

Maybe that's what it is. Like in a dream, how you sort of formulate these things that makes sense. You know, you formulate a calculator, you formulate a book, formulate a, a bed that you're lying in all that stuff that You understand. That makes sense. Maybe that's what's hap maybe it's so weird that it's like let's just, let's just say Yeah, you've been abducted. Yeah. That's so by an alien because you probably can't handle the truth. Yeah.

I think that's probably, that's probably true.

Maybe that's why the experience is so similar. Yeah. Not that, because otherwise you would say, well damn, aren't these fucking UFOs evolving quicker than us? 'cause if they're doing the same shit in 1950, whatever it was when Betty and Barney Hill were abducted that they're doing in 2025, that doesn't make sense because in 2025, like we have way better cars than we had in 1955 or whatever year it was. When they got abducted our car. I drove here in a Tesla. That fucking thing's a spaceship. Like I think about it sometimes when I'm in these things, like, these are so advanced in comparison to anything that existed before. Why aren't the spaceships more advanced? Like, why, why are they still like just showing up like that looking like a flying saucer? Don't they have a better model of this? Why are they sending us this old shitty tech?

Well, I think it might have been, they might have perfected the technology a million years ago. You see,

Oh, boohoo. How's that possible?

So you wouldn't expect necessarily change in the last 15

Years? No. If they perfected it, it would be non-physical. They wouldn't even have to like come here in some sort of a fucking alloy disc That seems so clunky. Yeah. That seems old school to what's coming. You know, like if artificial intelligence continues to make better versions of itself and then somehow or another figures out how to run on quantum computing architecture. Okay, well then you have digital God. Yeah. And why would digital God need a spaceship to fly around in?

Exactly. It's the whole thing is, is baffling and paradoxical and none of it kind of makes sense. Right. I think if we were able to view this phenomenon from a God, god, god's eye view, it would all kind of Oh, right. That makes sense. But Well, it's

Also you throw in simulation theory Mm. In with all that. Yeah, yeah, yeah. And then you go, okay, well what is this then? What is this really?

Right.

What is this really, like, maybe all the weird stuff like Bigfoot and all, all this weird stuff. Maybe it's, it's like a part of the weirdness of it by design, that it's supposed to be goofy enough that you figure out eventually that this is a simulation.

I think Yeah. I see reality as a kind of game in a way. I, I get the feeling that that reality is in some sense playful. And that's an ancient idea. I mean, that goes back to the ancient kind of Hindu philosophy. The idea of Brockman, the ultimate reality playing at creating the universes, they call it Lela, the idea that creating, you know, Brockman is the ultimate reality. He or it, or they doesn't have to create reality. It could just exist imper, you know, but in, in pure unadulterated perfection, you know, complete unending bliss. But instead it decides to kind of, to create realities to, to get lost for fun, to get lost. And we, we are kind of, we are part of, we do everything is Brockman as they say. Everything is the ultimate reality. And, and we are kind of lost within, we're tumbling in through this crazy world that seems really real and really important. Yeah. And, and, and fun and terrifying and all of those things. And it's, it's, it's a great ride. But then eventually we realize, oh, actually this is, it's just a game. It's all illusion, everything, all of all form is illusion. And, and I think DMT ultimately is, is an expression of that, you know, it it, it shows us actually that reality is far stranger than we we could possibly imagine. Yeah. And that actually, we don't know anything about what's, you know, the true nature of reality.",,,"Andrew Gallimore, PhD, is a chemical pharmacologist and neurobiologist.

It's actually all part of this cosmic drama, this cosmic game that we're playing. And we've, we've forgotten that we are playing. And perhaps one day we'll realize that, oh, we're kind of wake up from the game or, or work out, you know, maybe there is some, maybe it's like a puzzle. And DMT is one piece of that puzzle that allows us to figure out, you know, how to complete the game in a sense. And then we kind of, ah, fantastic. We've, we've, we've done it. And then everyone's, now this is why I think when people smoke DMT, they, there's this great celebratory uproar, you know, the lights are flashing. Yeah. He's here, he's here, he's back. Woo. You know? Yeah. And they, they real, they know. It feels like you're, you're interacting with an intelligence that really knows what's going on. And, and, and it's kind of excited that we, we, we are popping in temporarily just for a few minutes, but we are getting close. It feels like, you know, we've discovered the technology because, because DMT is kind of, it's weird, right? It's everywhere. It's like, it probably all plants, you know, Dennis McKenna likes to say nature is drenched in DMT because it is That's a good impression of him. Yeah. Really?

He got outta your accent. He

Did the whole thing. Yeah. You know, and, and, and yet at the same time, you can't just kind of munch on plants.

Right.

Because it's not orally active.

Yeah.

Right. So you,

You're aware, I'm sure of those scholars from Israel that think that the burning bush that Moses encountered was probably the acacia bush that contained DMT.

Yeah. This is, I know Strassman, one of his books, the Soul of Prophecy

Boy, he was blown my mind the last time he was here. He thinks the, the Bible is real. That it's real stories that may have happened in parallel dimensions. Wow. And I was like, what? That's

Exotic.

And I'm like, we're both, I'm like, I'm trying to like be on his wavelength. I'm trying to tune in

Because

He's so out there that guy's, so, so he's so out there. Do you know he learned ancient Hebrew Yep. Self-taught for 16 years so that he could read the Bible in its source language. Yeah. That's, that's serious. That's out there. Yeah. That's a dude in New Mexico. He's got plenty of time and he's just out there. That guy's out there. Yeah. But that's a very interesting take that they're true stories. You know, I was watching this very bizarre YouTube video last night. I got sucked in, I clicked on it and it was all about the Sumerian Kings list. And that the Sumer, they, they found a tablet in this unifor tablet that it shows this list of kings and how long they reigned. And then there's the great flood and these, some of these kings rain for like 40,000 years, 30,000 years. And then, and, and the, the, the total timeline of all of 'em I think is like 200 plus thousand years. And then there's the great flood, and then after the great flood, there's a very small lifespan. There's like 50 years they've run for 40 years. But all of the post flood kings are correct. They're all like historically they resonate with other historical texts, other CUNY form tablets, other different depictions of when this king ran, you know, Mesopotamia and this king ran Sumer and but their old versions are these like really weird, like pre-flood. It's real weird. It's like, what are you talking about 40,000 years? Like what do you, what does that mean? Are, are you just making it up? Is it just a myth? Is it, did were, was there a different thing here then? Like, are we just assuming that this lifespan that human beings have of, of 120 years is normal? Like, is this what we always had, or are what we are today a very bizarre version of what used to exist? Are we like a fucking chihuahua and we used to be a wolf? Is was, were we something very different at one point in time? And are we the remnants of whatever survived, whatever cataclysmic disaster that every ancient civilization depicts as a great flood? Like multiple different civilizations. Talk about this one event that seems to be a real event. Like what, what are they trying to say and why is that also in the Bible? Like, why was Noah like 600 years old? Like, what, why were these people so old? Like, what does that mean? Did you just get a, did, did you guys suck at calendars Or are we talking about a very different reality back then? Because if the great flood is true, let's, let's imagine there is a spectacular civilization. This, this is my most romantic view of, of ancient history. There's a spectacular civilization that exists. It exists in ancient Egypt. They have technology that's far beyond anything we've achieved today. It's just gone down a totally different path. And what they're really into is making these insane stone structures that defy any modern construction methods, any transportation methods. Everything's out the window. We have no idea how they did it. And they did it way before anybody was doing anything remotely like that. How old are those things? For real? We don't really know. Like would, would it, if there was some insanely sophisticated society where if you wanna figure things out, you're probably, it's probably hard to figure things out if you only live to be a hundred years. And then if everybody else has ego and everybody is like, that is not true. The laws of thermal dynamics cannot be, and like you have all these egos involved in universities, you have all these egos involved in the technology companies, and then of course political people like Z Haas who's in charge of the Egypt antiquities. He's the gatekeeper of all the information about Egypt. So you have all these kind of egos. Wouldn't it be like way easier to get past that if you live 50,000 years, if you lived a hundred thousand years, like you would think that kind of a human being or that kind of an intelligent creature would be able to accomplish way more. It'd probably get over overall it's bullshit by the time it's 150. And then it would be starting to figure out some things that, I mean, if it had no cognitive decline and it, it does live to be thousands of years old, that's not insane. 'cause we're just randomly living to be a hundred in 120 years. Like, wow, you may did it to 110 grandpa, what a great life. Those, they would probably look and go, that's a bullshit life. Like, you can't figure anything out. And maybe that's part of the design, that's part of it. Maybe that's part of the design to ensure chaos. Mm. Like if you wanna ensure chaos, you can't live long enough to recognize the hustle. Right. Because if you live long enough to recognize the hustle, you'd be like, why are we arguing? Like, right. Yeah. I argue way less at 58 than I ever did at 28, and I argue less at 28 than I ever did at 18. As you get older, you realize like, this is nonsense. This is a complete waste of time. And you could get through most disagreements with just cordial communication. Like you don't really need to argue as much as people argue. Yeah. But they feed off of it. And I think it's a stupid way to communicate. And I think if a society figured that out, like if a society is cons, it consists of people that live a hundred thousand years. If you have 30,000 year old people living amongst you that are far more intelligent than we are today, and that possibly communicate telepathy through telepathy, which there's some evidence that we do today. Oh yeah. At least a little bit. We do. We, you know, we're not the best at it, but there's some evidence that it takes place. We might be like the rejects, we might be the stragglers. We might be the, the, the fucking, the preppers that survived, whatever the hell happened 11,000 years ago. And we're just a shitty version of what designed all the pyramids, built the world, had some sort of bizarre technology that we still haven't figured out yet.

Yeah. I think we, we definitely live life on kind of hard mode. You know, it's, it's like, as you said, if if if you, if you only live for a hundred years or less, then it is very difficult to work things out in that way. It's

A Formula one race. Yeah. It's not a lovely stroll through the neighborhood. Exactly. Where you're like checking out the houses, look at that beautiful hill. Like, you know, it's,

So maybe it is part of it's part of the game is that

It might be Yeah.

That we only live for

It might be, or it just might be This is the shitty version of humans, and this is what the shitty version of humans makes. Like the really good version of humans makes pyramids. Like when a person can live to be 30,000 years old, that's what they make. They make spectacular, like homages to the cosmos on the ground.

Yeah. Or it could also be that, like the, the philosopher Alfred North Whitehead, he once said that you, you cannot prove that the world didn't appear five minutes ago. You know, you really can't. It's true. It's true. With all the memories and everything. So in fact, all of that stuff 10,000 years ago, it literally didn't happen. And that the world popped into the simulation was kind of booted up with all of that preloaded Yeah. To kind of keep us occupied about the grand, the grand mystery of, of ancient history. Like, you know, we, we get excited about it and fascinated, all, all those incredible things that were happening, it never happened. It might

Not have, it was just,

It was just freeloaded into the game to keep us occupied. You know?

That's what's nuts from your own personal perspective. If you weren't in World War ii, you don't know it's real. Right. Yeah. And I think about that every day when I wake up. Because when I wake, the weird thing about waking up is you're just assuming that you've been awake before. Yeah.

And that you're the same person, huh? Yeah.

I assume, yeah. I kind of know what it's like to be me. So every day when I wake up, I'm like, look, I'm me again. And I go, but how do I know that this is not my first run through this? Yeah, exactly. My first run through this with a, a shitty memory of the past, or an induced memory that facilitates my motion. It it keeps me moving in the same direction. It keeps me pushing towards whatever I'm pushing towards. And that's what Sam Altman gets every day when he wakes up before he creates his digital God. It's like, I guess I'm awake, I guess I'm doing it.

Yeah. You know, there is this fascinating Terrence McKenna, he, he often spoke in my head at least about these, what seemed to me as completely conflicting trajectories for humanity. In one breath, he'd talk about us returning to the archaic of returning to the forests and becoming one with nature again. And then in the next breath, he'd talk about us setting off for the stars. It, it seems like there's this, this tension part of us wants to go, we all want to live in an old rustic house that's made of wood in a forest and, and cook on an open fire. And yet there's this other part of us that wants to live in these machin buildings and, and, and be operated, you know, operating these highly complex technological machines. And it's like, you know, which way Right. You know, do we allow ourselves to be pulled back into the archaic or do we push past and transcend and become Posthuman, you know, or post biological. And, and maybe that's, that's kind of part of the game. You know, are we gonna be dragged back? Or, which wouldn't be bad to be dragged back into that more, you know, you can imagine the bucolic life in a, in a, in a, in a beautiful kind of forest scene with, with the nice old houses. And we all love that. Right. We all, we all, we all kind of yearn for that. I think. I mean, I do, I think, oh, there's part of me that wants to live in Tokyo where I do now, and this, this, this incredibly cyberpunk technological city that's, that seems like it's been secreted out of, you know, metal and glass and entirely unnatural structure that's kind of emerges from human intelligence. I mean, that's a weird thing. But in a way, these structures that we see, they, they seem entirely non-human. They see, it's like we are tapping into something else, something non-human and, and we can't help ourselves. And, and our cities that we build and, and these highly complex technological and computerized machines feels like they are being kind of secreted by our intelligence and, and pulled out of the earth. Right. You know? Well,

Maybe that's why they're also similar too, right? Yeah. They're similar in, they're, they differ obviously, in the way they look, but they're similar in the structure and they're similar in the density. You know, when you get the, I mean, there's enormous ones. Like I was watching this video of the largest city in the world, which I believe is in China. What is the largest run that into perplexity? What's the largest city in the world?

I hope they're gonna say Tokyo. I thought it was Tokyo, greater Tokyo.

I don't know the most populated, I should say

Populated.

When I say largest, I should probably say most populated. I think they were saying it's 36 million people. Okay.

Is the most, Tokyo is more,

Is it? Yeah. Tokyo is more than 36 million.

I think I looked it up the other day just cur I was curious. Like 37 or 40 million of the greater Tokyo area.

Interesting. Yeah. That's crazy. Yep. So Tokyo's number one. Yep. Okay. There we go. So this was probably the most populated in China. Well, okay. So that's followed by Delhi, India, which is 334 rather. 34,665,600 people. How do they know it's just 600? There's probably a few people snuck in there that they don't know about. You can't say that. Don't round that out. And then there's Shanghai, but it wasn't Shanghai. It was another city in China that they were talking about. Maybe they just exaggerated the numbers, but Yeah. Yeah, yeah. Okay. So Tokyo's a perfect example then. Yeah. Like, it's weird how like New York City, Tokyo and to some extent la although LA is just so fucked up, like the downtown is the most useless part of la It's really weird. Like downtown l Have you been to la?

I've been a couple of times, but I've not really explored. Nobody

Goes downtown. Okay. I downtown is like, they tried to revive downtown for a while before the pandemic, and then everybody gave up. But downtown, it's not like there's a bunch of like, like everybody has an apartment downtown. Mm. No. Most people live in the other areas of LA and downtown is like, there's some banks and some businesses, but there's also Skid Row. Yeah. The downtown is crazy. It's like a really fucked up place. A lot of abandoned buildings. Like downtown is where we did a lot of Fear Factor stunts back in the day, because we can get an abandoned warehouse to set up like a set there and, and, and do the show. So it's, it was, it's a very weird place. It's not like a, like downtown Chicago's booming, you know, it was downtown Chicago, downtown New York City.",,,"Andrew Gallimore, PhD, is a chemical pharmacologist and neurobiologist.

Downtown LA's not like that. 'cause LA's Broken. So when you go to LA it's like, downtown is like the most bizarre version of a downtown ever. Nobody wants to be there.

Yeah. Poor city design. I, I guess,

I don't know what it's, I think some of it has to do with what they did when they made Skid Row. So Skid Row is an entirely constructed thing. And what they did was all the vagrants in Beverly Hills and in Hollywood, like, listen, get the fuck outta here. You pick 'em up, you take 'em, throw 'em in the wagon, bring them to Skid Row, and then keep 'em there. Don't let 'em leave. Just contain them in an area. And that's essentially what they did. There's a documentary on that hotel. What is that hotel again? Jamie Cecil, Cecil Hotel where it talks about Skid Row itself. Like it's, the documentary is about this girl who was, they thought that she was missing, that someone had kidnapped her or something, but she was schizophrenic. She got off her medication and she apparently climbed into the water cistern and drowned. But the point of the documentary was not just that, it's like this lady came here not knowing what downtown was. Mm. And so she got a room at the hotel downtown thinking, oh, get a nice room at a hotel downtown, but like, it's fucking Zombie Boulevard. It's crazy. Show him what, what Skid Row looks like. Show him a video of what Skid Row looks like. Now, when we were filming Fear Factor, this was like 2004 ish, something like that. I accidentally drove through Skid Row. I drove to Skid Row. I was driving home back then, I think I probably had navigation on my, my, my car. It probably sucked. Or I wasn't paying attention to it. And this is skid row, skid row's, nuts. Jesus. This is close up. When you, when you have like a, like when you see it from a distance, you get a chance to see how completely insane it is. When we were filming, there was another fear factor we filmed there where one of the contestants was like, look, they're smoking crack. And we looked down and there was people, we were like on a rooftop or something. And then we looked down, people were smoking crack right in front of us. Right on the street. Like chaos, like skid rows, nuts. And this is, this is not even where the tents are set up, the where the tents are set up. It's the craziest thing you've ever seen. It's like these shanty villages that go on for blocks and blocks where there's no cars going through the streets are filled with homeless people. Just, everyone's on drugs and there's just tents everywhere. And you're like, what a failure of society. Yeah. What a failure of society that you've allowed this to reach the level that it's at now. That's la

Have you been to Tokyo?

Yes, I have.

Yeah. I mean, Tokyo's the complete opposite.

Complete opposite, you know, super clean, very orderly. People are very polite. Yep. Even though there's so many people in the street, everybody sort of navigates, moves around of each other in a very polite manner. You know, A beautiful architecture. Yeah. Stunning. Like cyber punk, as you said. Yeah. Very Blade Runner esque. Like, yo Talk, I was only there for one day for the UFC, so I didn't spend a lot of time there, but I got a, I had dinner there and I hung out there for a little bit. I was

Like, this is crazy. You know, it really shows you that it is possible to have a very large densely populated city that is safe and clean and functioning. It doesn't have to be, people say, oh, you know, I got robbed. It's just part of being in a big city. Or I was stabbed last night, or my car was broken into. And it's, ugh, this is just what happens when you live in a big city, man. And it's like, actually no, it is possible to have safe and clean. And, and, and Tokyo's fascinating because it's, it's an example of what's often called an, an emergent city. They don't have this very strict zoning where, oh, here it's gotta be offices here. It's gotta be houses here. It's gotta be small businesses or anything like that. It's like you, it's all mixed together. And, and different kind of neighborhoods kind of just emerged. You know, there's a knife district, for example. Mm. People who sell knives, they all gather together. There's a bookshop district, there's a, you know, districts for all different things because they not because someone has decided, oh, only bookshops can be here. It's just that they tend to gather together. Right. And so you, you know, you walk around Tokyo and you might, you'll find yourself in some quiet alley and you'll have little houses, and then you'll have a little store, often very, very tiny stores that have been perhaps operating for, for decades. And the if in the uk, or I guess in, in the States as well, they would've gone under decades ago. You know, the city would've just crushed them. Right. But it's, it's, it seems very easy in, in Tokyo to kind of open a small, if you have a house and you own it in Tokyo, you can, by law, you can, you can convert the, the first floor into a store. You'll get these little old ladies who will, they bought their house decades ago. They're retired. And they think, oh, what can I do with my time? I know I'll open a cafe. And they say they, they open a little cafe. Hardly anyone goes. Maybe it might be, it could be in the countryside, it could be on the outskirts or whatever, but it doesn't matter. 'cause they own it. And they're not being raped by, you know, taxes and stuff and all right. And, and all this kind of red tape. They don't have to deal with it. So they just have this lovely little cafe, entirely unique. They might fill it with things they're interested in. So it's, it's a completely unique thing that you can go in and she'll serve you tea. And maybe the cakes that she, she made this morning. And there are thousands of these throughout Tokyo. Not just little old ladies, but young people who own, who will rent very cheaply. They have these, have you seen in Tokyo, when you see the buildings, you often see these, these neon signs coming down the sides of the building. These are called Zao, which is basically miscellaneous use buildings. And, and what they are is just very tall buildings. And each floor you will have some kind of business. It could be anything. It's often bars or, you know, pool rooms or that anything you want, little restaurant, anything like this. And, and of course they can't, they don't have the, the frontage on the ground floor. And so they, instead they will put their, their sign, neon sign telling you what they are down the side of the building. And that's what gives Tokyo that unique look is because it's all of these Zao buildings. Mm. And sometimes if you go, A friend took me to this bar. Well, it was, it was like a, a building. It was in Kabuki Cho, which is right in the center of Tokyo. And it was, but it was on a side street. And there was this tall building, gray building. You would never look at it, no signage or anything. And you look at the, the elevator, when you go into the elevator that on each floor there's like a, a name of a business, you know, top hat eight Ball Enigma. You have no idea what these are. They're not on Google Maps. Right. So, and he just took, pressed the button for the eighth floor. He went up and it was just this little bar run by this one guy. And it was, you know, it played darts and had a drink. And a few people came in. Not many, because no, most people, most people, 99.89% of the population of Tokyo have no idea that this bar exists. Nor could they ever know, because it's not on Google Maps. There's no reviews of it. It doesn't exist. And I couldn't find it again, unless I call my friend and say, take me there. I can never go to that bar again. Ever. Because I, I dunno where it is. Right. And there's thousands of these. It's like,

That sounds amazing. Yeah. I want to go right now. Yeah.

But you gotta take a risk because if you just go, if you don't know. Right, right. And you just press the button, you could be some weird girls bar, you know, host bar, you know, and they, they kind of rip you off and stuff. There's a lot of danger in going to these places. Well,

There's a lot of Yakuza, right?

There's a lot of Yakuza in Kabuki show. Yeah, yeah. You gotta be very careful. 'cause they will drug you and then they will take you to a cash machine and,

You know, take your liver. Yeah. There's a lot of crazy stories. But when you see that and you live like that, like what keeps the rest of the world from having a city like that?

That's a really good question. And I don't wanna get, well, I don't know, but I think culture is everything. You know, obviously a city is all about the people. You've, of course, you've gotta have the infrastructure and you've gotta have, it's gotta be properly funded, but you also need the people that are going to take care of it. If you, people are trashing it and don't have respect for the city, then obviously it's gonna fall apart. But it's all about the culture. Ja. Japan is fascinating. The culture. I always say to people, when you go to Japan, you have to switch your mindset. So normally as a westerner, I'm thinking about me. When I'm out in public, I'm thinking about me. What do I want to do? Where do I want to go? It's all me. In Japan, you flip that. It's about you should, the first thing on your mind should be everybody else. When you hear Japanese people talk, you will about people who cause problems in cities, they use this word ku, which means often translated as nuisance. So people who come from the west, often America, but not just America, I'm not blaming everything on Americans, but it is often, and they come with their own, you know, they're, they're the main character, this kind of main character syndrome. Right. So they, you know, they're talking, they often, you see these Instagram videos of people on, on the, the metro, on the train. And they like, it's so quiet, you know, nobody's talking or nobody's kind of listening to music. And that's because they're always thinking about the people around them. They are thinking, you know, am I obstructing anyone? Am I getting any anyone's way? Am I annoying anyone? Am I making anyone feel uncomfortable? You are always thinking about those around you. And that leads to this very respectful, polite society where you can have 40, you know, 37 million people, whatever it is, crammed together, together in this relatively small area of land. And they're not killing each other. They learn, I was told, I'm not sure if this is true, but there's kind of a, I dunno if it's a myth, but Japan is very mountainous. And so back in the old days, villages were isolated. So when you lived in a village to get to the next village, you have to climb a mountain. Right? So you're trapped in your village. And so you have to learn to get along with the people around you. You can't run away. Mm. And and so the Japanese culture has developed in the sense that you are, you always have to be aware of the people around you. And, and that's, that's been passed down into the modern age, that the culture is always one of thinking about others and, and, and, and respect from a, from an early age.

That's what's so fascinating is like, how come no one else figured that out? And also what's really strange is Japan itself right now is in the midst of population collapse. Yeah. Sadly. So that's what sucks. It's like you could lose this and it could be overwhelmed by the west. Like, because of the fact that they aren't having enough people to reproduce successfully to maintain their population. It could just be taken over, like in terms of immigration. Like Americans could just move there and Europeans can move there. And then all the beautiful aspects of this very interesting and very unique culture Yeah. Could go away.

And they are really concerned about that. When I was, when I was first, when I first arrived in Japan, like 10 years ago, I was worked at a university and I was stood on, on campus outside just talking to someone. And I saw a couple of, like, they looked like high school students probably on a, a campus visit outta the corner, my eye, Japanese high school students. And they, they caught my eye. They, they saw that I was looking at them. And as soon as that happened, they both like on a dime stopped and bowed to me. And I thought, wow. Wow. We're not in Kansas anymore. Wow. You know, and that, that having that teaching children about respect from a very, and, and, and training them, you know, the idea of respect your elders. This is, you know, we have this in the west as well, but we kind of lost it a little bit. Yeah. And it's kind of drilled into them about respecting the people around you and respecting people who are older than you. And this probably goes back to the samurai, you know, these hierarchies.

Yes. Yeah. I'm sure. Mm. I'm sure. Just, and then you, you think about like how crazy futile Japan was and that it eventually evolves to what it is now. This incredibly safe society. Yeah, exactly. Which is really kinda nuts. Yeah. Do you think about one of the most war-like cultures of all time? Yeah. The culture that fought off the Mongols successfully, you know, pretty nuts.

Yeah. Yeah, it is. And and, but you see it, you see the remnants of that kind of, the ancient societal structure. Even in the language, when you learn Japanese, there are several levels of politeness. Oh, right. You have, so it's really complicated. But you have something called cago, which is kind of formal or polite speech. And if you are talking to, if you are lower down and you are talking to someone above you, you have to speak in a different, even the words, the verbs are different. The words are different. Mm. And if you are speaking about them, then you have to use what's called honorific la you are elevating them. If you are talking about someone higher up, you have to elevate them. You use honorific language. Mm. If you're talking about yourself to someone who's higher up, you use humble language. So you lower yourself down. So you, so it's very difficult, you know, it's still, I still kind of struggle with it, but, and, and it actually causes some problems because it's very difficult for junior people to communicate with senior people to communicate honestly, at least. So they just, you get a lot of it like, yes, men, yes, I agree. You know? Oh, yes, I agree with that. You kind of agreeing with everything that the senior person says. And that's not a way to, to make good decisions. It's by just agreeing. And so they have something called communication. So this is formed from two words, communication, of course, plus namu, which is the Japanese word to drink. And they're talking about alcohol. So Japan, in Japan, alcohol is king, and society is actually lubricated by alcohol and functions because of alcohol.",,,"Andrew Gallimore, PhD, is a chemical pharmacologist and neurobiologist.

So Japan, in Japan, alcohol is king, and society is actually lubricated by alcohol and functions because of alcohol. They have things called in, in Japanese companies, they have these kind of semi obligatory, you know, semi compulsory events called Nami Kai, which basically translates as drink meetings.

Oh

Boy, you might have heard about these. And then basically the senior people and the, the more junior people, they all go together. They'll go to a bar with this express purpose of getting drunk, not just to like have a drink with your colleagues, but to actually get drunk, becoming intoxicated. And that allows more free flowing communication. It allows you to, everyone is brought to the same kind of level. And this is, this is non-communication. And so it's facilitated by alcohol communication, facilitated by alcohol. So it's a society that is dependent on alcohol in, in, in a strong way.

What is their approach to other drugs? Like, are what, like even casual drugs, like marijuana and stuff like that? Are they highly illegal over there? Yeah,

It's complicated. I would say it's weird because, okay, so when, when it comes to the law, people always say, oh, Japan, it's got, you know, the strictest drug laws in the world. First of all, no, it hasn't go to Singapore, you know,

Settled down.

Settled down. Yeah. But when it, when it comes to drugs, cannabis for, probably for, you know, after the second World War, when I think it was MacArthur that was drafting the, the Japanese constitution and was basically controlling. I mean, it had, it was occupying Japan, of course, after the second World War. And, and America was in the, what's that movie called? That 1950s Moody Weed Madness. Reefer Madness. Reefer Madness. Yeah. It was, America was in the kind of reefer madness phase. And they, they passed that onto the Japanese. And the Japanese have never really gotten over it. So, but, and then there's meth, of course. I mean, meth came from Japan. Meth was invented in Japan, right from the, it was used during the second world, ka kamikazes, the kamikazes. They actually used these little green tablets that were called storming tablets. Oh boy. They were mixed with green tea and stamped with the crest of the emperor. Oh. So they became like sacraments.

Oh my god.

They, they would pop those. Yeah.

Woo. Yeah. See how that worked out. Yeah,

Exactly. Yeah. But then at the end of the second World War, when they had stockpiles of these methamphetamine, and it started to, it spilled out into the black market basically. And large, very large numbers of people became addicted to, to meth. And they were actually in Osaka in I think around 1954, I forget the exact year, but in one year the police raided, I think around 50 meth labs in, in one city operated by, you know, one or two people, like mom and pop operation. It's like breaking bad, right. You know, like you imagine meth labs in, you know, Arizona or something. Now, this was happening in Japan in the 1950s. And it scared the shit outta the, the Japanese government, because they were a defeated nation. They thought that they were, you know, it was the end of their civilization. And they thought that meth addiction was the symptom. It was gonna actually, perhaps catalyze the, the end of the, the Japanese. It was an existential threat to the Japanese civilization. So they hit it hard legally. And so now when, you know Japanese law, they're really focused on cannabis because of probably the American influence and meth. But psychedelics, most people in Japan probably don't know much about. There's a psychedelic subculture in Japan. There are ayahuasca circles in Japan that operate in a gray area of the law. It's not explicitly illegal. It's discouraged, but it's not explicitly illegal. I know people who import ayahuasca, raw ayahuasca drink from, from the Amazon and operate ayahuasca circles. You

Didn't, did you do the DMTX experiments in Japan?

No. Where

Did you do them?

So, okay, so we're gonna get into DMTX. Yeah. Yeah. So DMTX came from an idea that I had in 2015. I worked with Rick Strassman on this. So DMT is kind of unusual. It has these weird pharmacological peculiarities. It's, as I said before, it doesn't have subjective tolerance. So Rick Strassman showed in the nineties that you can inject someone with, with DMT repeatedly. And they have the same intensity effect at each time. But it also has another kind of a number of unique peculiarities. Of course. It's very, very brief. It's, it's, it enters the brain extremely rapidly. It's metabolized rapidly and cleared very rapidly. It had all of these pharmacological peculiarities. And it occurred to me that these were precisely the characteristics you need of a drug that's used in anesthesiology. So in anesthesiology, when they want to put you to sleep, make you unconscious. What they don't do, they don't just inject you with a drug and kind of hope that it keeps working whilst they've got you under the knife. What they do is they use a very short acting drug, and they use an infusion machine, which delivers the drug, the anesthetic drug into your veins and goes to your brain and holds the brain level of the drug constant over time so that they can keep you in the anesthetized state unconscious for as long or short period as they like. And so it occurred to me that, well, DMT has the right drug properties. It's like, it's almost like it's designed for that, that kind of technique called, it's called target controlled intravenous infusion. And so I thought, you know, if we start, if we take the DMT states seriously, and we treat it as a new world to explore and, you know, intelligent beings with whom we can establish communicative relationships, then three minutes of a breakthrough trip is nowhere near enough. And so I thought, well, let's take this technology from anesthesiology target controlled intravenous infusion, and let's repurpose it. So instead of an anesthetic drug that's delivered by programmed infusion, we instead deliver DMT by programmed infusion and induce somebody into the DMT state and stabilize their brain DM T levels. So you can hold them in the DMT state for 30 minutes, or potentially for several hours, and have complete control in real time over the depth of the experience. That was the idea. So I worked with Rick Strassman, I used his data, blood sampling data that he acquired in, in the nineties. You know, fortunately he had this old Excel file, which he sent to me. And I built this mathematical model of DMTs metabolism and distribution throughout the body. And then we wrote a paper basically saying, we think this should work. We think we should be able to extend the DM and stabilize the DMT state for many hours. But we didn't actually, it wasn't kind of human ready, so to speak. And it actually took about five years before it was actually implemented in humans. So that was actually done by the Imperial College London team. So they were the still are in a way, the leaders in, in psychedelic research and a guy called then a PhD student, I think Chris Timmerman worked to make this proof of principle model that myself and Rick Strassman had developed and, and get it human ready and actually test, you know, does it actually work? Do do the, do the predictions that we had, myself and Rick Strassman, do they actually work in humans? And they found out that in fact, that it does, that you can induce somebody into the DMT state and you can actually stabilize the experience. So rather than just being a, oh, Jamie, since I'm talking about this, I can show you actually what DMT trips or the kind of the time course of A DMT trip looks like over time. So normally what happens is the blood level will rise very, very rapidly. You inject some of the DMT blood levels rise, they reach the brain, and then almost immediately they start collapsing down again exponentially. And, and that brief period when the brain levels are high, is the breakthrough state. However, if you, when the brain DMT levels reach a kind of a peak, you then start an infusion. You can basically compensate for the DMT that's being lost by metabolism. It's a bit like if you have a, a bathtub full of water and you pull the plug the water drains. But if you turn on the taps Yeah. Mm. You can keep the level constant. Right? And so that's the infusion. So you, you, you stabilize the state. And our, our hope was that the actual experience itself, rather than that initial rollercoaster phase that you get with DMT, where it's all very, very disorienting and he's like, you know, what's going on? That's, for most people, that's, that's kind of it. And then you're dragged back out again. But our hope was that actually over time, if you stabilize the dm, the DMT in the brain, that it would actually stabilize the experience, then people can actually navigate and explore the space and even perform kind of experiments within the space. And this is what's become known as DMTX.

Hmm. And how was that? What did they describe?

Well, so this first study that was done just a couple of years ago, as I said by Imperial College London, it was really a, it was like a pilot study. They wanted to show that it w that it worked and that it was safe, that it was tolerable, that people weren't going crazy, you know, that they could handle it. Basically, the very first person to do it was a guy I'm now working with. I, I work for a nonprofit called New Nordics Outta Florida. And we are very interested in designing experiments using DMTX to actually study the DMT space and, and the intelligences within them much more kind of formally. And on the board, I worked with a guy called Carl Smith, who was the, the very first person to undergo DMTX. He was also the only person to complete, I think there was five sessions over several weeks. He was the only one who oh boy, handled it, so to

Speak. Oh boy, what's his name?

Carl Smith.

Shout out to Carl.

Shout out to Carl. You fucking

Pioneer.

You, you know. But what's interesting is that the, as we hoped and predicted, the, the DMT state, it does stabilize. It's like the brain is settling into constructing this alternate world model or interfacing with this, this, this intelligence. And he found that as he went back every time he was interacting with the same entities, and they became aware of the fact that he was coming back so often. And they were like, you know what, what are not you again? You know, you, you, you are back. And, and one time they were scanning him, the, the Imperial team in like a, I think like an MRI machine or something. And the entities were gathered, all the entities. He said, as soon as they started scanning me in the quote unquote real world, the entities were gathered and they seemed like curious or confused, like, well, what are

They doing? What are the signal? Right?

Yeah. Right. It's like, maybe it's the signal or something. Or they were like, you know, we are the ones that normally do the scanning or, you know, we're supposed to scan you, you know, what's going on here? So there's this, as I said, it was just a pilot study, but there's a real taste that you can enter into these, these kind of relationships with these entities. Oh. And actually we, as I said, I I, I work for this. I'm a, a board member of this nonprofit called New Nordics. And our vision is really to design experiments with DMTX. Like what would, what does a research organization look like that isn't simply trying to explain away DMT, explain it, but actually says, okay, this is a unchartered land that's, that's fascinated, that's inordinately complex and vast and filled with intelligences. Let's treat it like that. Right. As explorers, what does a research organization aimed at studying that look like? You know, and, and we imagine, I imagine that you're not just sending, you know, for example, let's take the structure of the DMT space, right? It's this highly complex geometrically and topologically strange domain. So we send in people who are experts, who are mathematicians. We send in a, a mathematician to study the topology of the space to study how the space is structured. The entities, they often try to communicate, they, they use strange symbols and strange code, oh, let's send in a, a linguist who can study their language. And so you are, you are sending in people with their own specialties to actually formally study the DMT space. Whoa. And what's even better is we now have a venue for this. So we're actually, we have a, I work with a company called Elis. We have a special license from a, a, a country in the Caribbean, St. Vincent and the Grenadines. And we, we are setting up a retreat center, stroke research center to provide DMTX that is a hundred percent legal. That is safe. You know, you've got anesthesiologists, psychiatrists and nurses, you know, a perfect setting that's also being designed in part by Carl Smith as well, that allows you to perform these kind of research, research studies aimed at analyzing and studying the DMT space. But even better is it's also gonna be open to anyone. So if you think about, prepare

For the freaks,

Prepare for the, they're coming. But like, you know, in, in the nineties, Rick Strassman, he did the biggest study of its kind. You've only had 60 people, right? So you've got 60 people worth of trip reports. What happens if you can bring in 300, 400, 500 people a year? How will you

Vet people to make sure they're not crazy before they do it?

There will be a screening process of an initial screening process, and then ultimately you would have a psychiatrist who would sign them off. So it's not just anyone, but anyone can, in theory, they can sign up, they can go to luc mind.com and they can put their name down and sign up to fly to this island Beck Way, I think it's called. And in a beautiful, perfect setting, spend a week on the island and undergoing a number of DMTX sessions and, you know, being able to explore this world using the DMTX technology. And of course they will all be providing trip reports. So you, you start to amass a, a vast data set of highly controlled verified, you know, this isn't, this isn't like posting online where you, you don't know what drugs they've taken really. Right. Right. It's like, you know exactly what they've taken. It's pure pharmaceutical grade DMT, and they, they will generate this vast data set that could be used. We are also working to develop a, an AI powered model that would take in this verbal data and in real time, generate imagery. So someone can talk to the, the model, the AI model, and it will generate the image. And then you say, oh no, this isn't quite right. This needs to be more like this. And so you are converging on the,

You're making a map of the

Territory. You're make making a map of the territory. And so you, you end up with this vast library, not just of textual trip reports, but also of, of imagery.

That's the thing about these ancient civilizations. Mm. Whether it's Egypt or whether it's ancient Greece where Ulysses was from. They all were using psychedelics. Mm. There's, there's evidence of psychedelics in all of these ancient civilizations. It's just our completely twisted sick society that's decided that the most beneficial drugs should be the ones that are the most illegal. Yep. Which is, and you lump them in with the ones that destroy lives. They're, they're categorized with meth. Yep. Which is completely insane. And the sign of a twisted sick culture. It's the sign of what McKenna was talking about with the chaos. The chaos of a species that's preparing to leave for the stars. Yeah,

I think so. And, but things are changing. I mean, you do see positive changes now. The internet, the attitude to psychedelic the internet change. Well,

People understand it now. And I think there's also a, a giant shift towards people on the right. Accepting it. Because so many soldiers have come back from war and used it and, and had great benefits. Yeah.

Precisely. Yeah. Yeah. So facts, perhaps things aren't as bad as perhaps things. Things in some ways are getting better. They're getting worse in other ways, but they're getting better in other

Ways. They, they're moving, right?

Yeah. They're moving def. That's

It. And I think you need bad in order to inspire. Good. Yeah. That's unfortunate. But I think that just historically, that's always been the way Yeah. That we figure things out. Yeah.

I agree.

Andrew, it's been so much fun. I really enjoy this. Let's do it again. Let's do it again when the place is open for sure. And when you get some, would you like to trip reports? Are

It does Just because a mess. Because my mind is a mess. I wish my mind

Was mess. You're creative. That's how it works.

Is that how it works?

Yeah, I think so. Is

That the excuse we

Use? I dunno. I'm trying to make myself feel better.

I think that's the excuse we use for each other.

Yeah. You know, like, I'm a creative, it's, it's my go-to default.

Is the compression on something sounds weird? Yeah. Oh, it's just really loud. Something happened. Maybe my ears got better. What happened?

You can hear now. My ears aren't very good.

Sometimes I, you know, when I'm underwater for too long or I swim or something like that. And then I forget that my ears have water in 'em and then they come out like, oh, there's that moment where like, oh, this is how I hear. Oh,

I feel like I have the in ear monitors for my job. And

Oh,

Right. I still, like, I've been using 'em for, I don't know, 20 years and I'm still not used to 'em. Like, I come from like honky tonk world where you can hear everything. Yeah. Hear the room.

Well, it's so good that people have them now. 'cause boy, so many people I know from back in the day are almost deaf.

Oh yeah. We, I'm so glad we have them. It's not the same. I mean it, you don't feel the energy of the room, but save your hearing, which is

Helpful. It's a good trade off. Yeah, true. I mean, you can hear it enough. It's a good trade off. Yeah. And so many of my friends who shoot guns too, same thing. Yeah. You know, they started hunting when they were kids and no ear protection back then. Yeah. And you know, you, you say something to them and they're like, what? Like they're all, they're all half

Death. Yeah. My dad was a police officer and he's, I swear that's why my parents are still married because he can't hear it all. And the dog ate his hearing aid and he never replaced it. And I'm like, is that on purpose, dad? That's

Hilarious. That's hilarious. Yeah. You definitely develop an ability to shut things off. Yeah. Otherwise, because men and women think and communicate differently. Yeah. And if you want your wife to communicate with you the way your buddies do, then Well, you married a dude. Yeah. Okay. So if you want to be married to a woman, you have to listen. You have to like, listen and everything with both ears. And sometimes it's like round about journey to get to the point and you can't go, what the fuck are you talking about? 'cause then they're like, oh my God, why are you so hostile? So you have to go. Okay.

Okay. Selective hearing.

Yeah, selective hearing.

But my husband will like, I'll say it and I'll be like, say it back to me. And like, and I found that when I do that, it's worse because I'm like, I'm like, say, say what I said back to you get bananas at the store. So he comes home, I'm like, where's bananas? I didn't get any. So don't repeat it. Just hold it in there.

That's hilarious. He blocked it out for himself.

Yeah, exactly.

That's very funny. Yeah. The the earing thing, the hearing thing is kind of nuts that no one knew. Like, it just makes you wonder, like when did people, when I wonder when people were aware that like loud music was gonna kill your hearing.

I don't know. Like, just, I mean, I, I've had the in-ears for a long time and they did save all of our ears. But it's like, I think that, and then like, the longer you go, like still, even though I have those, like I turn them up way too loud. Oh, do you? Because I'm like missing. Right. The energy. And so

Do you ever, you ever just say, fuck it for this

Show, take one out. Like sometimes when it's like a house band, you just get to use wedges. I'm like, yes. This is amazing. What's a wedge? It's just like the little onstage monitor. Oh, right. You know what I mean? So, but it's just so loud. I mean, it's so loud. And I also do, I do mounted shooting. And so

I saw that. That's crazy.

And so it's a good reminder. Like the first time I took off on the first, I just started last year. I'm not good at all, but I love it. And I took off on my horse and I forgot to wear ear plugs. And I was like, well, I, I'm a musician. I probably plug my ears when I'm shooting a revolver off of a horse.

Yeah. But it's, is it a revolver using a regular bullet? No, it's black

Powder.

Just the powder itself. Yep. So it's just

A spectator safe horse safe.

So it just sprays, sprays

Powder.

Powder and air

At the balloon.

And it pops balloons. Yeah. At how, what, what distance

It could shoot, I think 15

Yards. Feet. Feet. Oh, okay. Yeah. So you're just riding around the horse popping balloons.

I love it. I do.

What was the origin of that sport?

I don't know. Actually, one of my best friends, her name is Ken Sane, and she lives out in Scottsdale. She's like the 10 time world champion and whoa,

Whoa. Hold on. We became, there's a world championship of popping balloons on a horse. Yeah.

It's called mounted shooting. And Oh, cowboy mounted shooting. But she's cowgirl and she's like, guys', girls, everybody, she's a badass. And became friends with her. And I just never had the guts to go do it, you know? And finally my husband was like, stop talking about it and go out there and do it. Go out there and shoot with her. You're gonna love it. Wow. And I got addicted immediately. It's just like something different.

Well, it's very wild west, right? Oh yeah. It's essentially training how to fight with a gun on a horse. Yeah. That's all it is.

Except it's the balloon is the Yeah. Perpetrator.

But I mean it's, that's how you would train. Yeah. It's super Right. Without killing people.

It's super fun. And it's like, you know, just something that like started a new hobby at 40. Like, it's just try to like preoccupy my mind and, and I don't know, I think it inspires me to like, take a break from thinking about what I think about every single day, which is music industry, you know? So just like trying new things and saying, what the hell, let's go for it.

I think that's very good for artists. I, I try to talk to comedians about that all the time. I'm like, get pick up something, man. Yeah. Like

Hobbies are

Important. Play golf. Go fishing. Do something. Yeah. For me, I play pool, do something. So

I just started golf too. Oh, I remember. I try new things. Era. There

You go. You try new things. Era. Yes.

My, my yes. Era. Like sure, I'll do it. Started golf. Not too great yet, but I did, I just played the Ryder Cup.

Oh, nice.

They had like a celebrity. Hmm. Somebody heard, I played golf and I, when they heard that, I literally started like that day.

Jamie's a nut and I Jamie's a full on golf nut. Like

He's literally was like cramming my ass off like this September because I was on tour all summer and I didn't have time to practice. And you know how that feels like golf is, you have to practice and do you have a

Coach?

I had a coach, yes. No, Dan, I have a coach and he came with me as my caddy. Very helpful. But it was, it was an experience. It was a lot of pressure. Like,

Did you feel it even though like, no, it didn't expect you to win. Oh my

Like, yeah. I mean I just felt like, what, what, what the hell have I done when I got there? It's like, play doing something you don't do in front of people. Right. A

Lot of people. But you do it, you just don't do it a lot.

Yeah. And I don't, I do things in front of people, but it's singing.

You do things in front of people and you're really good at it. That's the difference.

Well that's the thing. Doing something that you suck at in front of people is a very scary place to be. Right.

Right. Jamie has OJ Simpson's golf clubs,

A couple of them. Not all of 'em. I have a few. That's

Awesome. How many do you have? It's not really awesome at all. Drivers? Well, I mean, they're haunted.

Whatever you're into

Couple. Dr. How many you got? Three.

No, I mean I got a whole, whole set. But

Do you use them?

I I used one of them.

D is, did you hit Well?

I have, that's why I used it.

Why are they blister curse? I

Dunno. I mean, well, he bought it as a goof, you know.

Yeah. It's just fun to talk about. It's a fun

Joke. Just one of those things. Conversation starter. It came up. Was it, did you get 'em after he died? Yeah,

Yeah. Yeah. I mean, I got 'em like six months ago. Yeah.

I forgot. I forget when he died

A couple years ago.

Well, that's cool. I mean, I,

I guess, but it is really important having some kind of a thing that you do to take your mind off of the business. 'cause the people that I know where their mind is only on show business, whatever it is, music, comedy, whatever it is, they go crazy. You, you can eventually get lost in your own little world. Yeah. Like you need a little break.

You do. And I, I think it's like, you know, especially if you're like a writer, like you gotta go live to write about it or what are you writing about? Same shit you already said. Right. You know? Right. It's like I need to go live a life and gather information and be around different people and Yeah. Sort of open my circle up to just, I don't know, different experiences. Something Yeah. A different environment. Yeah.

Yeah. My friend Ari does that. He disappears for like three months every year and a half or so. Like, he gets rid of his phone, gets rid of his email, he

Like goes off grid.

Oh, he goes off grid. He goes to Asia. He backpacks through Asia and he's famous. He's a famous comedian and he doesn't give a fuck. He just goes and vanishes for like, we can't find him. No one knows where he is. I don't hear from him for like three, four months. I just hope he's alive.

Well, I'm not, I mean, I'm just shooting balloons and swinging a golf club, but I'm not, nothing as cool as that.

But the thing you're doing, the thing about both of those things is they require all of your focus while you're doing, I mean, if you're riding a giant animal while you're shooting a gun, like there's no room for thinking about, oh, I gotta do laundry. Right. You know, there's no room. You just, you're just doing that thing only.

Yeah. That's what, what, that's what I think I loved about it and got addicted to. Yeah. You know, and I guess I don't really have, I always say I don't have like an adrenaline junkie in me, but I guess I'd have to have a little bit for joining the circus like I did. You know, like Yes, you do.

It's kind of joining the circus. It's,

Yeah. So, but like, I think that just that little, that the focus and the little jolt Right. That you get of like, you know, the, the same kind of high we get like after a show, you know, it's like, right. I still guess I need that, but just in a different form.

Yeah. Joining the rodeo. Yeah. There's, there's something about shooting at things too. I do archery and there's something about shooting at things that also just really cleans your mind because in that moment, while you're pulling a trigger, there's no room for anything else. Yeah. If you're trying to hit a target, there's no room for anything else and it just, it pushes all that stuff away. Right. It gives you like a little, little mental vacation. Yeah.

A hundred percent. And then

You come back like cleaner. What kind of

Bow are you shooting?

I shoot a compound bow. Compound bow. Yeah. A Hoyt. Yeah.

Yeah. I used to shoot bows. I have a long time, but Oh really? I, I got 'em back out during 2020 when I had all the time in the world. And my husband's from New York City so I was like, I got these bows, I'll, I'll teach you how to shoot a bow. So we just set up the targets and got 'em all fixed stuff and it was fun. I mean it is fun. It's the same thing I think you're talking about.

It's very similar.

It's focus. It's just, even if it's just for a little while, it's that little moment in time that this is all I'm doing right now.

Right. Have you ever bow hunted?

I used to be a hunter. Yeah. Yeah. Yep. I did. I hunted for a long time. My dad tree

Stand. Yep.

Okay. Or ground blind either way. Right. Bow hunting was my absolute favorite to, to do because it took the focus and it was intimate. Yeah. And it took a lot of skill and practice. Certainly bow hunting to make sure you're gonna Yeah. White tail. White tail. Oh

Nice.

But I raised a baby deer a buck. Aw,

That's a problem. Yep.

That's a problem. So my hunting days are behind me. Peace on my heart.

We found a buck with a broken leg on our property and my wife took to feeding it. Yeah. And all of her enthusiasm for me hunting kind of went out the window.

It changes things. Yeah.

Because it's kind of like a dog. Like they're,

They're they, he was just like a dog. Like they, they're sweet. A full grown,

They come right up to you. Yep.

Wild ass whitetail, deer like became like my pet.

And it's different than any other feral animal in that they domesticate like that

They really do. Like he was literally, I'd come home and he would run over to me like a dog. So definitely changed my mind.

Well I think it's because they're dumb. Unfortunately. I think nature has them set up to be not very intelligent and just food. Yeah. You know, and he's a beautiful food thing. Yeah. That's really what they are.

Yeah. My dad, my dad, you know, I grew up hunting with him, like taught me how to shoot a gun and all that stuff at 17. And when I raised that buck, he was like, it's over, isn't it? Yeah.

It's

Over. It's over.

It's over. Yeah. I'll never raise a baby elk, I'll tell you that. Yeah.

Don't do it. I don't love elk hunting too much.

Yeah. But I, I get it. I mean we have deer in our neighborhood and I see these little cute babies that are born every year and you know, we stop the car. Oh my God.

Especially so cute.","{

"uld listen to stories that they would tell me about like things that they got into and they were getting into things like that. Like on a daily basis. Yeah. There was always shootouts, there was always car wrecks. There was always murders and domestic violence cases. And it's like, man, how many of those guys are just walking around with severe PTSD. Yeah. And no one cares. No one respects it.

No one's talking about it. No. Like they're just, you know, I, I think that like they don't even acknowledge it themselves. Like I know my dad worked vice in Dallas for his whole career and Woo. And back in the day like, and my and my husband like they just don't, and then they just come home and like, you know, I'd

Kill my hearing aids too. Like

He's like the dog ate, I guarantee you that. He just threw it away.

He fed it to put peanut butter on that fucking thing.

Good job Reclaimer. We know what you did. Now he put peanut butter on it. That's just wrong. It's just wrong in so many ways.

Yeah man. He probably needed peace it and quiet. Yeah.

He needs mom to hush.

Yeah. Everybody shut the fucking world off. Yeah. You know the, one of the greatest pool players, if not the greatest pool player of all time is deaf. There's a guy named Shane Van Boning. Really? And he shuts his hearing aid off when he plays Just

So it's just silent. Yeah. Just

Fuck off world. Wow. And he's just in his like you people could be screaming in the crowd and he doesn't hear shit.

What is it about pool? Like what's the, you said you play pool, you like

It. I've been playing pool for 35 years. Yeah, I've been playing forever.

But what is it about that particular,

Because the balls don't give a fuck who you are. They don't care what you think you are, they don't care who you know how much money you have. You know what you've accomplished already. How many shots you've already made. The balls don't care. The pockets are four and a quarter inches wide. And if you don't hit it perfect, it doesn't go in and it requires all of your concentration. And if you really know how to play pool, then you're dealing with like English. So you're dealing with like spin on the cue ball left and right and you're dealing with draw and follow. It's a dance of the mind in these orbs. You're hitting a ball into another ball and trying to get that thing to go straight. And it just requires this complete harmony of hand eye coordination and your spirit. Like you have to like stay calm while you're doing it. That's why

God, that's a very, that's a very good explanation of that. I'm the worst pool player of all. I mean you would think like playing as many honky tonks as I have played that I could play pool.

Most

People, it's so bad.

People that think they could play pool can't play pool.

Most people don't.

It's like, don't know really how to play pool.

Like back in my day it was like just a place to flirt.

Yeah. It's that. It's that. The thing about pool is once you get down the road and you start to understand, you get, you really start getting the game and understanding the, and then playing in tournaments and then gambling. Then you're dealing with like real pool players. And these real pool players play pool eight hours a day.

Wow.

Every day you have to because you know how the thing of like being comfortable on stage or being comfortable riding a horse or being comfortable like shooting a bow or, or playing golf. Multiply that times a hundred and you have pool because pool's the only game where you take a stick and you hit a ball into another ball Every other game you hit a ball, you just hit a ball with a stick. But in pool you're hitting a ball into a ball and controlling the movement of both balls. Like the one that's hitting the ball. You're controlling how it spins off to get perfect position on the next shot. And then the other one, you wanna make sure it gets the exact right angle to go into the pocket while you're like calculating all this spin and the geometry of the table and Void collisions. It's maddening.

It's very like, I just got anxiety. It's maddening. I just got stressed out. It'll

Drive you crazy. It'll, it's a game that will drive you crazy. But when you catch it, there's a thing called being in stroke and and being in dead stroke. It's a rare thing. It happens like, you know, once a month or something like that where you just can't miss where you know where everything is and it's just like calm that comes over like the world dissolves and all you feel is the table and you're completely in sync with the movement of the balls. You know how many revolutions each ball is gonna make. You feel the difference between two extra revolutions, like you know where, how hard to hit it. Exactly. And that's what everybody's chasing. They're chasing this feeling of being in dead

Stroke. Why does it happen happen once a month because

It's so hard to get there. You, you'd probably get, I'd probably get there all the time. If I played like a pro like eight hours a day. You probably get there once a week, but nobody stays there.

But that's probably the draw that keeps you coming back to it.

Yeah. Dudes do drugs just so they can get there. They get hooked on pills they get because they find that like maybe it's amphetamines, maybe it's opiates, whatever it is. Like some guys will do drugs and find that spot and then go back to drugs just to get to that spot.

From pool. From

Pool. Yeah. Dang. Oh it's a nutty game.

I mean I've never, it's a nutty game ever dug, dug into it like that but

Oh, at the highest levels. Guys are gambling from hundreds of thousands of dollars in these fucking weird places in Kentucky and weird pool hall. And they're streaming online on YouTube. They're streaming on different websites. Dang. Oh, it's at the highest level. It is a crazy game. It's a crazy game.

Well I never knew that, but I learned a lot about that

Today. I know a dude who's one of the best in the world and he can't travel because he needs pills. 'cause he so he can't go like overseas. He can't go anywhere. He can't travel without his pills. If he does, he won't play. Right.

Really?

Oh, it's nuts. Yeah,

It's a head game.

Oh, what's that? That's it. It's, there's my friend Jeremy Jones, he won the US Open when greatest players of all time. He's like, it is the MO and he plays everything. He played baseball like at a high level. He plays golf plays. He's like, it is the most mental game really. And that's why nobody's good at it. That's why it never gets to a, it never got to a place where it was like really appreciated professionally. Right. Because you have to know how to play it to be, to understand what you're seeing. Yeah. To really see people play well, you have to know what the, what's happening.

I don't, I'd never, I'm not like good at any, I've not played sports, so I'm not good at them.

No sports

At all. Well, I didn't really, I mean, I grew up kind of playing softball here and there, or so is golf.

Like the

First thing, golf is my first and my mount shooting, which is technically labeled a sport.

That's a sport for sure.

So that's like, it's new to me. Like sports are new because I just, I don't know. I started this at 17 and didn't and just was laser focused, like horse with blinders doing country music. And then what

Is it like going from just being a regular high school kid and all of a sudden 17 just being thrust into a spotlight?

Well, I wasn't in the spotlight at first. I was playing shit holes with no lights. But

Even shithole, there's some kind light You're on stage

The pole light. Yeah. Well, well, I, I don't know. Like, I just, I don't know. I, I feel like that I, I didn't have a choice. It picked me. Like I, it's the only thing I've ever been good at. Everything is hard. It, everything else is hard to me. But like music was the only thing that I was like, I guess that's what I'm supposed to do. 'cause I'm actually good at it. Like, thank god it comes naturally

Followed it though. So many people have a thing like that and they say, oh, that's just unrealistic. I can't do that.

I didn't have a backup plan that helped. There was that I, I barely graduated high school. I was like, I don't wanna waste my dad's money. That does help Going to college. I was like, I have no backup plan. So like, it really does help. The hunger that it creates is like a fire that you can't explain.

Yeah. You know, and it's not good advice. I would never give the advice of don't have a backup plan because some people are not gonna make it. No, you're right. And then they'll blame you. Yeah. You know, you're told me I shouldn't have a backup plan. Yeah. But I really think that for someone who's got some talent and some, a real desire to do that, and, and you can stay the course and you could deal with the hard times. Like you can't have a backup plan. You cannot, because that backup plan will rob your time. Yeah. That's the thing you have to think of. Yeah. It robs your focus. Yeah. It steals from your energy. Yeah. So it'll stop you from reaching your full potential. Fuck your backup plans.

Yeah. I mean, it didn't come from me. Yeah.

It came from me. Fuck your backup plan.

And I don't wanna get blamed, but I, I just think that's like, the reason that it happened is a lot of hard work, obviously, and determination, but just nothing else. I have nothing else. Like I was terrible at school, terrible at sports. Had to get tutoring, had to like, stay late for the cheerleading dance. Like everything was just hard for me.

Right. But that's just because you're a great singer. Like that's where your mind works. Like, it's just such a wonderful thing that you found the thing that you're really good at. 'cause some people, some people don't, they just don't know why they, they suck at school. They don't know why they can't pay attention. They don't know why they can't be at work on time. They don't know why. They're like, what's wrong with me? And if maybe that person just found that thing and they're like, oh my God, I'm supposed to be riding horses and shooting balloons. Exactly.

Here I'm, I found me. Yeah. I think it's, I I feel like we're the lucky ones when we get to like, we know like, this is, this is what I'm supposed to do. This is what I'm gonna chase no matter what it costs. And you know, that doesn't, I see so many people that are so immensely talented that just didn't happen for, and Yeah. And you don't, and you don't know why. Like the why you said it, you don't know if it was one little factor of a period in their life or just not seen at the right time or chasing the right thing at the right time. And I don't know, I feel, I feel very thankful for that. But I'm also like trying to learn new things at 40 because I spent my whole adult life doing that. You know what I mean? Yeah. So now I'm like, what can we do next? Let's find another hobby. But that's

A great approach though. Yeah. That's great. I mean, it's recognizing you want to have some more stuff in your life. That's interesting.

I think that does come, I don't know. Does that come with like

Wisdom with age,

Age wisdom and, and also feeling accomplished? Yes. I mean, I feel like I set my goals, I hit them. Yeah. You know, and that feels like, oh,

Kind of made it like,

Okay, let have some fun.

Yeah. And what's disappointing ma? The whole idea of making it is like your life will be better and you'll have Well your life will be better if you have more fun. Yeah. Like find some stuff you like to do.

Exactly. You seem like somebody that chases a lot of new things and conquers them, which I think is really inspiring.

Well, I chase things that can never conquer. That's, that's the key.

Well, that's like that. And no one told me that till I started playing golf and now it's too late.

Yeah. Well

You can't ever win.

For me, it started with martial arts. You never conquer that. You, there's always gonna be somebody better than you. Especially if you're not a professional,

But you get really, really good at the things that you're pursuing.

But it's probably mental.

You spend time on that illness.

Something wrong with me. I, I'm for sure if I was born at a different time. I was born in the sixties. They didn't really diagnose kids with a DHD when I was a kid. And

Oh, we both have it dope

'em up a hundred percent.

We a hundred percent have it. A hundred

Percent. I got it. Whatever that fuck it is. It's a superpower. It's a superpower if you use it, right? Yeah,

I think so too.

Yeah. Just the idea that you have to medicate a kid 'cause he can't sit in school. Like find out if that kid's good at other stuff. Right. Find out if there's a thing that a hundred percent. Yeah. Okay. Maybe they can't sit there where someone's teaching them math. Maybe they get bored real quick. Maybe they start talking to her friends, whatever it is, they probably have a thing they're really good at. If they could find that thing. I bet they're focused like a motherfucker when they're playing video games. Right? Yeah. So what's that all about? You know, find the thing that that kid can lock into. A

Hundred percent agree. Yeah.

The thing is like, you make people do things that are completely unnatural. You make people sit down when they're six in a chair. Why? Some lady who's making $35,000 a year doesn't like kids is teaching them some shit that she doesn't care about. So there's no energy in the room. Yeah. Everything. And then when they're out in the yard with their friends are having fun and they're laughing and mad, so they're looking around, this is

Bullshit.

This class sucks. And they're talking to each other. And then they get in trouble for talking like, Ugh. Yeah, your child's a problem. Is the child really the problem? Seems like the child has a lot of energy. That's not a problem. Yeah. You just, you're not providing an inspiring environment for a, a growing mind. Just turning you into a, a dull drone. Some worker that just is capable of like shutting themselves off all day and then showing up and then just doing some stuff that they don't wanna do because they were taught how to do it when they were a kid. Like blah.

I feel like there's a lot more opportunities now than there was.","{

"w. I feel like I also met my husband in like a crazy way. And so I can't help but believe in fate.

Like I, there's something to it. Yeah.

I believe in it.

Yeah. There's something to it. As much as I my mind want, my rational mind wants to ignore the possibility, like the randomness of the universe, the size and scope of it all. Do you really think it matters what you do you really think? But it does to you. Right. It has a giant impact on your life and everything matters. Just because there's black holes doesn't mean your fucking, your homework doesn't matter. You know, everything matters. Right. Your whole world, everything matters. It's like, you can't think that things don't matter like that. The universe wouldn't have a plan for your life when it seems to have a plan for everything. Yeah. I mean all of it seems to be happening for some sort of a very bizarre reason. Yeah. All of it together. So I'm sure that there's something to fate, but it's just my rational mind wants to go. That's just your ego. It's like silly. You could have been bored in Somalia, you know, life could have sucked for you. You know, it's, it's hard to, because fate's a weird one. Like you can't measure it, can't put it on a scale, but it seems to be real.

Yeah. What's real for us. Yeah. So then it's real,

I guess

Now also I'm like, your ceiling is giving me Yeah. I love it. The little shooting stars. Yeah. And you were like, fade is real. And it was like, boom. And I was like, yeah, it's,

If I don't tell people I didn't tell you, but sometimes people,

I love it.

They're like, am I having flashbacks? Like, what's going on?

It's awesome. That's what I love about West Texas. Something about like, it's just so vast in the middle of nowhere. Mm. Like the stars are, they feel like they're, we call it the thunderdome when we're, we like lay in the yard and it just feels like they're, you could reach up and grab them because it's so dark out there. Yeah. It's magical.

Well, they're on top of you and you don't have any light pollution. Yeah. Yeah. That's the thing that ruins the world. Yeah. That's the problem with New York City. That's why everybody's so stew. They're, they're like so like stuck in their own world. Just 'cause like they don't realize they're in space.

Exactly.

You know? Yeah. You don't get that break. Yeah.

No

Breaks. This is a, a break that you get from space that I don't think you get from anything else where you just like look up and you go, oh yeah, okay. I'm taking all this shit way too seriously. Yeah. This is nuts. Like just above us.

It totally is. And I also, when you said that, it made me think of what we were talking about earlier about wisdom and like, I don't know, just kind of reaching some goals and taking a breath and calming down and going, okay, everything's okay. It's like I just feel like I saw she starting lost my train of thought. I have a DHD, I'm like, I lost my whole maybe to shut the ball.

Well we were talking about space. What

Happened? Where did it go?

Pew squirrel. What are you zening over there? What are those?

Oh, these are loosies. They're breakers. You, do you ever take these?

I don't dunno what they are, but it's, I like zens.

You like the Here try these. These these are strong though. They're Oh,

Like what Sixes?

Nine. Oh,

I'll pass out.

Yeah, don't do it. I'm

Not doing it. That's not for you. I'm not doing it.

This is strong. This one's not. Yeah, these are nines. I got some

Fours

Over here. Oh, you got some fours? Yeah. Oh. Chuck me a fours. Huh?

What are, what's the loosies, why are they different?

They have like a little thing inside of 'em that you, you, they're called breakers. Okay. So what do you do? So it's like coffee flavor you put in your mouth

Just like it in

Yeah. And you crack that little sucker open. It gives you a little blast

Of flavor. A little, yeah. Little sugar. Almost like a little, yeah. Piece of cupcake. Little pizza candy

In there for You. Good. Those are fours, right? So it's not bad. Oh lord. That's a nice, I get up

Four's nice if I get up and run outta here. Saw I already couldn't concentrate 'cause of the shooting.

I saw a dude online. He got a a 50 milligram one from overseas. What? Yeah. And he tried it and you know, he was violently ill lying on the ground. Like

A terrible, why would you do that?

Well I think he did it for props, you know, like, so he could get some online cred just for the views. Did it for the gram, did it

Work?

I mean, I guess you it, I watched it. I wanted to, I'm like, you're gonna take a 50. Oh you're fucked dude. And he said, oh my god, it's like drinking battery acid. And then he was lying on the ground at the end of it. It was like, I really fucked up. I made a giant mistake. 'cause it's so much nicotine. 50

Milligrams is crazy. But, but you're so like, so into health and just take such good care of yourself. And I What is the bit what? Like why are I just tell people, oh they're good for you have one. Well what do you think? Like tell me your opinion of these. There's this whole craze, there's

Nicotine is not bad for you. Correct. The delivery method is what's bad for you. And the delivery method with cigarettes in particular with cigarettes that have a bunch of chemicals added to them that's even worse. Like the regular cigarettes. Like natural cigarettes I bet are probably not as bad for you. Dr. Suzanne Humphreys, she's a, a physician who was on here was explaining to us like why regular cigarettes are not as bad, but there's still, it's still not good for you, you smoking in your lungs. But nicotine itself is not bad. Nicotine itself is neuroprotectant. Nicotine itself actually is a nootropic. So, which means it's cognitively enhancing. So nootropics are like vitamins that help brain function. And there's a bunch of 'em, like have some here we have some stuff called Alpha Brain. That's great. I've seen that. There's a bunch of companies that make different versions of a nootropic, but there are, there are nutrients that enhance memory and enhance your verbal, verbal memory. So your ability to recall words that can enhance peak alpha flow state. Like they've done like real, they've done two double-blind placebo controlled studies at the Boston Center for Memory with Alpha Brain. It shows more effectiveness than any of the drugs that they had studied over the past, like nine months before they did this. So like, this is pretty impressive. So nicotine does That too? Yeah. Nicotine enhances your memory. Enhances brain function. Enhances it, stimulates you. So there's a lot of benefits to nicotine as a, but the problem is like, how do you take it? How are you taking your nicotine? You know, probably one of the best ways is maybe gum, you know, and these, these things

Because people are wearing patches now and stuff. Oh, fucking

Crazy people. That's Ron White. He wears a goddamn patch. What you doing Ron? I got a patch on it. I'm smoking. He's got a cigar. He is got a zen fucking animal. But

So good.

He's such an animal. But I think there's, there's real benefit to, I know a guy who puts a nicotine patch on for productivity when he writes.

Well that makes sense to me. Like I feel like, 'cause all the songwriters are, you know, right now it's everybody in Nashville's singing and I'm like, oh, I'll try one. And it like really does give you a little

Stimulant.

Yeah. And also have a lot of words in my head. I need to remember words and I also need to write new words. You should. So anything to help with that.

Anything you want. If you want help with memory. Alpha Brain's a really good one's.

I wanna try that because that's a good one. I just think like at some point too, when you're tired, you know, it just, it feels like you, like you can't, I mean you just saw me lose my train of thought. It's like I don't wanna be on like a bunch of Adderall and stuff. No. I wanna be on, I wanna find a different method to like have my brain functioning. Eat the best it can. These

Are addictive though. And I gotta say different people have different levels of like how addicted they get with these. Like some people can't not have them. I went on vacation, I said I'm gonna go on vacation and not bring any and see what happens. See if I freak out just to see and nothing, zero nothing. It was like I kind of missed them maybe for a day or two. Like wanted one didn't have any. And then after like three days I was like, oh, this is fine. Yeah. It's not, it's not like a physical like, oh my God I'm jonesy.

It's not like smoking.

I'm a shaken. Yeah. Yeah. But I've, I know people that have tried to get off of 'em that really struggle.

I mean, it, it is addictive. I mean it's nicotine. I

Think the vapes are the hardest to get off of

The vapes. Like that's, I don't want heat on my voice either, you

Know? Right. That's, well, vapes aren't really hot, but it is. If you buy them ones that are like in the gas station, like who knows where those are

Being, but like, but the ones that heat up.

Oh yeah. The crazy ones. I like that. Adam Curry. Do you know Adam Curry is, he's the first podcaster. He used to be the MTVV. Oh yeah. Dkng. Yes. Guy with beautiful hair.

Yeah.

Yes. Good. Good friend of mine. He carries around one of those robot lunchbox vapes. Those big old crazy ones. Yeah. Where you're blowing murder

And it makes like noise. It's

Like kind of like a power bar on the side of it. So much. It's so ridiculous. And he blows this giant, but it's all like, he, he fills it with natural oil. So it's air quotes healthy. Oh, air quotes. Yeah. But

That's what they, that's what people say. They smoke American spirits.

Yeah. It's healthy. Come on, there's an Indian on there. Yeah,

Exactly.

How come they get away with that? Is, are American spirits owned by Native Americans? No. No. So how the fuck do they have a Native American on there? Not catch any slack. They do, right? Don't they have

An's a badass pack? They got in trouble in the past for stuff.

So did they? Yeah, I'm not,

I'm not getting

Into it. Oh. Getting into tobacco company problems.

He was like, and Pivot.

Did you ever see that movie The Insider with Russell Crow? I don't think so. It's about a guy who works for a tobacco company that is explaining, he was a chemist and he was explaining how they added all these different things to make it more addictive. And they're trying to kill him in the film. 'cause they don't want that information getting out. Ooh. He's the insider. It's kind of crazy movie and based on a true story. Wow. Yeah. I watch that they, they put a bunch of shit in cigarettes to try to get you hooked. Well,

And they do it. Yeah. I mean it works people. It does. That's the hardest one. I feel like it's, it's the most, you hear people talking about trying to quit that and drinking to me like, you know what I mean? Just on the daily. Like I'm in a band so everybody's like, oh I quit now they're all like, do you go to Zen? You got a Zen like Yeah because it's just highly addictive. I guess

It's, it is, but it's, it's people want something. They just want something to take 'em outta whatever state they're in. Gimme something. Gimme a drink, gimme this, gimme a coffee. Like everybody I know that's an Alcoholic's Anonymous. They all smoke or drink tons of coffee. It's either or both. Yes. Because they're just want to do something. Get me. Something's not gonna make me suck dick for bus fare, but I'm gonna least get a little bit of something different than regular life. I don't wanna be homeless. I don't wanna be cracked out. But yeah, gimme something. Yeah, just gimme a little something. Take me away from wherever I am right now. Yeah.

Not that far away. Just a little bit away.

It's that little next door. Let me go next door and hide.

I'm gonna start saying that way. I'm like, can I have his in? Can I go? I, I need to go next door.

Yeah, I'm gonna go next door just a little bit. I don't wanna go too far away. I could hear everybody but

Am I supposed to like break this little candy thing?

I do. Yeah. I break it right away. It just crack down on that little sucker. What's

In there?

Probably candy. Ooh, nice. Right. That's

Like a little burst of happiness.

Well burst of flavor.

Yeah. Oh wait, next door.

I like those. I like those. That's funny. My buddy Duncan found out that his blood sugar goes up when he vapes. 'cause he was buying those gas station vapes and you know he got, it's terrible. He got type two diabetes 'cause he was eating too much sugar. He's okay, don't worry. But he realized 'cause he monitors his blood glucose that like when he was vaping his blood was going through the roof. I go, okay. Why do you think that is? Like, why do you think it's strawberry flavored? What the fuck do you think's in there, bro? You're eating candy all day. Like you're vaping on sugar. Oh

It's like sugar. Yeah. Oils. Yeah. Yeah.

It has to be. Yeah it has to be. I mean if it's like grape flavored or whatever the hell it is, it's like there's some, some also, who knows what kind of oil they're putting in those damn things. It

Stinks

Pretty. It's probably made in China or somewhere. I watched a video on TikTok of these dudes testing them some. Some dude is just sucking on each one of 'em to make sure they work at the factory.

What's gonna happen to him?

I don't know what's gonna happen to you because you're sucking on the same one that he was sucking on. Nobody cleans those things off. You just get 'em at the gas station and stick it right in your mouth. That's

Like a karaoke mic. Yes. That's nasty. So nasty. Okay, I'm spinning this out. Oh, to pause. Pause.

Oh you get rid of it. Oh.

Gave me, it's like a

Buzz.

Yeah. It's like a little bit little.

Yeah. A little next you went next door.

Yeah. I like that. Yeah. Excuse me. I'm going next door.

Yeah. So anyway, nicotine vapes not, I don't think they're good for you folks. Sorry. 'cause people thought they were healthier for you than cigarettes. But it turns out like no, not only are they not. Yeah. Here's this look that, oh God, look he's testing all of 'em. All those cute little pink ones. He's gotta make sure they all work.","{

I don't know what's gonna happen to you because you're sucking on the same one that he was sucking on. Nobody cleans those things off. You just get 'em at the gas station and stick it right in your mouth. That's

Yeah. It's like a little bit little.

Yeah. A little next you went next door.

Yeah. I like that. Yeah. Excuse me. I'm going next door.

Yeah. So anyway, nicotine vapes not, I don't think they're good for you folks. Sorry. 'cause people thought they were healthier for you than cigarettes. But it turns out like no, not only are they not. Yeah. Here's this look that, oh God, look he's testing all of 'em. All those cute little pink ones. He's gotta make sure they all work. By the way, how hooked is that guy? That guy must

Be, that's awful.

Fucking hooked. Where is this taking place? I have no idea. Does it say in the, that guy has to test all of 'em. I would like to see like what that guy's look. That guy looks a like he's 15 years old.

Did you see the bottom?

No. It says

Seven to 8,000

Tests per day.

That's terrible,

Bro. Test his lungs. 'cause there's a thing called popcorn lung that kids are

Getting. Yeah, I've heard of that.

The thing about these things is that they're, they're very, very addictive. They're more addictive than I think any other delivery method. Yeah. Like you just, and the thing about nicotine vapes is the first vape of the day is the only one you really want. The first vape of the day. I would take a vape and be like, this is wonderful. Like, this feeling is wonderful. It's wonderful. And then you chase that dragon and you never get it back until the next day. Yeah. The rest of the day you're sucking on this thing going,

Yeah,

Nope, nothing. And then I'm not getting it. I'm not getting that wonderful feeling. Yeah. You have to have no nicotine in your system. And then you have that one hint. It's like welcoming into your life.

Do you get like, do these people get like that feeling from those patches?

I don't think so. I think the patches just make you

Like a little Adderall.

Yeah. It's like pe I'm sure people have Adderall patches, don't they? Do they have an Adderall patch? I don't think so. No. Adderall's a sketchy one. I had some in here the other day that was telling me they were doing Adderall right before I want, I did an Adderall just so I'm ready.

Like it's like it's a writing. It's very helpful for writing. Oh I'm sure. It's like you don't want to have, I don't want to need it. So that's why I was, was like, what brain thing's gonna take? Yeah. What are loosies?

What does it say? Jamie? Oh, amphetamine patch. There it is. Oh sure. Are a DHD treatment that lets you control your time your way. They always say that. Like, look, this is a, a woman who's in control. Look at her with her jean jacket on her arms crossed. I am in control. She's got a control posture. Look at her posture. I'm on a meth patch. I'm in control.

A meth patch. Please Lord. No,

You are literally on a drug that will kill your superpower. You got a superpower and you're killing it with a drug. So you could

Focus on I definitely don't want a patch of that.

Yeah, no thanks. I'm scared. No thanks. I don't need it. Hard pass. Maybe. Maybe somebody needs it. I don't wanna judge. But the reality is that stuff, the, the amphetamines in any shape or form are highly addictive. Yeah. And they're passing 'em out like candy. Yeah. My daughter's in high school and a bunch of kids in high school have air quotes. A DHD. And because of a DHD they get Adderall. And then also they get more time on tests because they got a DH, adhd. They can't focus. So they're fucking on speed

Tricks of the train and they get

More. Yeah. And so because it's very competitive. Yeah. Parents want to get their kids into colleges. They're, they're, you know, getting their kids diagnosed so they can get their kid hooked on whatever. They're probably already hooked on too. 'cause a lot of people that are adults are hooked on it. Yeah. And you can tell those folks 'cause they come to the, the parent teacher meetings and they can't shut the fuck up and they just wanna talk to you about everything. Oh my God. They wanna corner me and ask me about some episode. I did. Oh my god. I love that episode that you did with the kind about climate

Your eyes.

They're so cracked out. They're so obviously cracked out and there's a lot of people out there just running around cracked out be, but they feel like they got it from the doctor. The doctor gave me this, I'll tell you that. 30 milligrams and I'm just a better person. I think it's better about all tasks. I I'm

Actually my, I like talk to that person daily. Like I feel like I, those people are everywhere. They're

Everywhere. Yeah. Well we looked it up. Use perplexity, which is one of our sponsors, and find out how many prescriptions for Adderall they wrote in let's say 2024. Let's take a guess. How many

Do you think? Ooh. I mean, I could not even ballpark that.

I wanna say 40 million. I bet it's 40 million prescriptions at least. It's probably a lot more. But I'm going conservative and I'm saying 40 million prescriptions for Adderall in 2024. What do you want? You wanna guess? Yeah, take

A guess. 40. I say 51.

51. You're probably closer. I bet it's like 90. I bet it's nuts. I hope it's not. I bet it's because it's like individual people refilling prescriptions. You know, I don't think it's like 90 million patients. I be It's a lot. I bet it's all journalists. I feel like most people that are writing things this Yeah, I bet that in. What is it? Okay. How many Adderall prescriptions were written in 2024? According to Perplex? 45 million Adderall prescriptions written in the United States. Well we were both in the middle. Yeah. You what'd you go? 51. Yeah. I said 40 commonly prescribed stimulants for conditions such as a DHD and narcolepsy. This number falls several years of notable growth. Huh? It's weird. Are more people need it?

It's up since 2019.

Look at that. Yeah. Notable growth data suggests the prescription rates begin to decline slightly after a, a sharp surge during the COVID-19 pandemic and shortages affected, I'll stop. Hold on. 2019 it was only 35. Interesting. So it's up 10 million. Who? That's crazy. 41.4 million in 2021 and 45 million by 2023. I bet there's a lot of people getting it illegally too. Like what's that number? Okay. Let's, that's 'cause you, there was that shortage and Right. Know if they've covered, recovered from it. Well also, once the shortage started, people got dealers. Sure.

But people are using mushrooms and stuff for that now too.

That's a very different thing though.

I've heard, I've heard a lot about that.

Yeah. Microdosing mushrooms is a, that's a very different thing than Adderall. Yeah. That's like the opposite of Adderall.

Yeah. Even if it's for focus. Mm. Right. Like

Well I'm sure it'll help. Your focus

Is on something.

Yeah. But you gotta be, you gotta mine your P's and Qs when it comes to your dosages also. Like where are you getting that?

That's just scary for me. Like, I'm like, where is it from? Like, did you just go to the cow pasture? 'cause that's like what teenagers did when I heard they were doing mushrooms. Like they were like cow tipping and going, you know, from East Texas. So Yeah.

Well they definitely found him growing on poop. I mean that's how all humans originally probably discovered psilocybin. They found him on cow poop. Yeah. But the thing about that though is like, you gotta get 'em from somebody who knows what they're doing. Yeah. Because there's, they're all different and you can get some that are crazy strong. Like there's some out there that'll knock you into another universe. So what are you doing? Are you just eating a cap? Are you paying attention to the, are you getting them in pill form? Who are you getting them from? Like I have a friend who,

They're all my questions too

Gets them from a friend. And I was like, who you who?

It's a good friend

Guy. Who's the guy that you, you not seen these things get packaged, get the fuck outta here.

It's a little, little shady. Super

Sketch. Yep. Super sketch. Yep. And they're, they all, it's like marijuana edibles before the, the legality in California when it was medical they'd be, it was crazy because now they, they, because of the regulations in California, I think the most they could make 'em is 10 milligrams. Which is normal. Yeah. It's a normal dose. But before that, when it was medical, like it became medical in the nineties, they would make 500 milligram Chiba. These, these things that like they're 500 milligrams, which is insane. It puts you in another dimension

That's, I never even heard of that.

They're so strong. And my friend Joey, who's a real demon, Joey used to take the wrapper off of 25 milligram ones and give people a 500 milligram one instead.

Oh. He throw a, a real demon

And he would just laugh because he can, he could tolerate insane doses. So he would give people like preposterous amounts.

I have a songwriter friend and I love her dearly, but whatever she says, do this. I'm like, do a quarter of that, whatever that is to the public. Do yourself a surface. Do a quarter of that.

Some people have ridiculous tolerances

For marijuana. Yeah. I mean it's crazy. Yeah.

For anything.

I'm just over here taking a Lucy from a random dude.

Well it's only four milligrams. I'm kidding. It's minor. It wasn't that bad. Right. I would never like the nine. I would've told you like, spit that quick.

That's

A lot. Real quick. It's a lot. Yeah, it's a lot. I have twelves.

What do you do? You use those for real busy days?

I don't like 'em. They, they jolt me too much. But I have them. This is just 'cause Lucy sent them to me, but I think the right dose is three or four. That's right. You guys just a little pick me up just a little.

Not the cracked out. Not the cracked out. Cracked soccer

Mom crack. Yeah. Not the cracked out. Not add. I've never tried Adderall. I've, I'm scared of it. I want to try it one day because I'm scared of it. 'cause I'm like, I need to know what everybody's fussing about because everybody I know that's tried it is like, don't try it. You'll love it.

You'll love it. You'll fucking love it. It is focus. Yeah. I mean it is, it really hones hones in. I have a

Buddy of mine and his wife told him to stop 'cause he was snorting it 'cause he was writing. That's

Insane.

He is like, that's the best way to get it real quick. He, and he was like, to his wife, he was like, why do you care how I do it? She's like, you are snorting drugs while the kids are asleep. He's like, okay.

Yeah, it's a little far, dude. Slow your roll.

He's not an addict though. He just, he just felt like he's

Not an addict though. He's not an addict.

He felt like he had to snort to really get the most outta it, it quickly.

Well everybody, like you said, everybody's trying to find something like,

Because I think if you take it as a pill, it probably takes like an hour before it kicks in and he didn't have an hour. So he is like,

I have a deadline. Yeah. Does your friend that disappears, does he like, have he doesn't have phone, no digital. Nothing. No. Nothing.

No.

I wonder if that digital detox is like one of the hardest ones. I feel like

It's gotta be the hardest. Yeah. I've done social media detoxes for multiple days and you genuinely feel better. Yeah. And then you go, why am I doing this to myself? Or I don't do this.

I know all the time. Something that's annoying. If I can just say it is that like, when people do take a break from social media, that's like all they tell you about the whole time. Well, I'm on a break from social media. I'm like, yes. Can you be on a break with broke without telling anybody that you're on a break from social media. Right.

They have to tell you how virtuous they are. God, I am actually gonna break of social media unlike you. I'm

Like, cool bro.

You you little addict scrolling through cat videos.

Doom scrolling.

Yeah. There's a lot of doom scrolling. Yeah. It's like people who do yoga, they can't shut the fuck up about it.

Yeah. It's like a lot of things. Or people with like a special, a special like a special diet. Like oh yeah, carnivore. Oh, you're hearing about it. Carnivore. You're hearing about it.

Vegans are the worst.

You're gonna hear about it. They're the absolute worst. Like,

Like no one has ever met a vegan that didn't tell them they're vegan. It doesn't happen. They

Always tell you never. Not like that. They working

Do it as a spiritual growth. Like, just like, as like an

Exercise. It's your little secret with yourself.

Yeah. Your little secret with yourself is you are not on social media,

So don't tell me. My

Favorite is people who are on social media making fun of people that are on social media. 'cause there's a lot of like, really means not self-aware of people. Yeah.

Like, it overwhelms me. Honestly. I'm trying to, you can't keep up with it. So I just try, I don't try to keep up with it, but like, I was just talking on the way here. I was like, maybe I need to get on TikTok. It's like there's a lot of music on TikTok, like there's a lot of musicians and like Yeah. We have a label now called Big Loud Texas. Our, our office is in Austin. And I'm like, I know there's amazing talent on there. And one of our flagship artists, Dylan Gossett, posted something awesome on there and now he's out there crushing it. So I feel like I'm missing out.","{

". That's a drone. They're

So

Bad. Put in my yard by China.

My husband is probably dying out there that I even brought this. He's like, are you talking my soup? Our chicken. So I'm just being there. He's like cooking and I'm just like, I'm painting my chickens right now. Always

Chickens.

I don't know why. I have no idea. It's easy. That's why. Fate. It's

Fate. You're designed to be the greatest folk. Art chicken.

That's my next song. Folk art. Fake painter

Of all time. Folk art fate. Imagine if that's what it is. Like there's something that compelling. You tell the world about chicken folk art.

I guess. So. Here

We go. You watch chick. Do you have chickens?

Yeah, I do have chickens. I have

Chickens.

I love chickens.

Chickens are great.

Right? They're awesome.

They're really cute. They're the ladies. I go in the yard like, hi

Ladies. The ladies. That's why I call 'em. I say, Hey ladies, I give them all the scraps. They love everything from the table. Like any leftovers. It's funny to watch 'em though 'cause they're like picky. Like the other day I thought they would eat like leftover breakfast. Casserole wouldn't touch it really? But they were all, they didn't eat the biscuits. Chickens don't like biscuits.

Well, maybe they know that breakfast casserole is eggs and they're like, Jesus Christ, this lady's fucking nuts. She's trying to turned us into cannibals.

Ridiculous. Because I didn't think about that.

Right. Maybe it's like,

Oh no, what have I done to my ladies?

It might be like a natural reaction to them. I'll tell you what they go crazy for is mice. Have you ever seen what, oh yeah. Yeah. So this is how I found out. I used to have a house in California that my wife, she changed our back fence. It was a wrought iron fence. And she changed it to glass. And when she did, she, she signed a death warrant for a bunch of hawks. And they kept slamming into that fucking glass. And like three of them died in our yard. And one of them got kd but survived. And I was on the road and she had told me about it. And they'd taken this, this hawk and they had put it in a box. And when I got back we got 'em what's called pinkies. And what pinkies are, are these little baby mice that have, they feed 'em to lizards and snakes. Like that's what they're for. Like when you go to the pet store, they sell you these things. They're not weaned from their mother. And you feed 'em the snakes. I know it's dark. So they, they bought a bunch of 'em and fed this hawk, these little baby mice. And it ate all of them except one. And my daughters were very young at the time and they're like, we wanna keep that mouse. We wanna raise it. I'm like, honey, you can't, it's not gonna live. Like it's not weaned from its mother. It won't survive. I go, I'm just gonna go see if the chickens will eat it. I put this thing down and these chickens attacked like they were raptors from Jurassic Park. One chicken grabbed it and they all chased her around. They were

Stealing it from what in the world are you saying?

Pulling it out of her mouth? It is the, they are so ferocious. Like you've never seen anything like a chicken with a mouse.

I have never heard this in my life.

I'm gonna show you a video. And this video, oh, do I wanna see this? There's a bunch of videos of cats with mice. So, so this is a mouse. And why, why do these chickens? My god. They just kill this mouse. And look, they all attack each other trying to steal the mouse away from the one chicken. And has it, do they eat? Oh, they eat it quick. Yeah, they devour it. Hmm. So there's another mouse in there that they don't know about yet. So see there's one with a cat. So the cat is playing with the, the mouse. Like, you know, cats don't kill it or an they wanna play. And this chicken just runs over and snatches it from the cat. Like,

Fuck you. I have never heard this in my life. So

Look, the cat has a mouse and chicken's like, gimme that bitch. They just go, look, it's got a mouse. And the cat's like, Jesus Christ, you guys are psychos.

Well, who knew? Yeah.

Well because they're dinosaurs. That's who they are. They're just dinosaurs that are really small that survive the impact of the asteroid.

I also love dinosaurs, so maybe that's why. That's it. Chickens. I'm called to paint my folk chicken.

You just don't realize how ruthless they are until

You see, I've never heard this in my life. This is blowing 'em. I'm country as a bump. And like I've never heard this. They

Destroy mice. Yeah. Dang. Destroy 'em. They love 'em. They tear 'em apart.

Well, I'm not gonna go do that, but I'm glad I know that now.

Like nothing I've ever seen before. We also saw a mouse that got loose in the chicken coop once they, we had a big chicken coop and a mouse went in there and I saw these chickens just tear that mouse

Up. Well the ma casserole is not offensive to them

Eating their own babies.

They're not, we don't have a rooster.

Well I know, but they don't know that you're right. You know, they brooded sometimes

I think baby know. I just let 'em sometimes. And I'm like, do you? Well I just like, sometimes they look at me like, let me just sit on this. Like, like, okay, you can have it. That's your egg out.

Yeah. But they pluck their feathers out.

I know. They, it's a lot.

They get real. They get real. It, it makes you sad. It's like they wanna be a mommy. They do. Yeah. And you don't let 'em, we had a rooster once, but he did not last.

I do not enjoy having roosters. They're roosters soul

Fuckers. They're me. Yeah. He attacked my wife and she's like, we're done. Me

Too. Mine attack me. I'm out on rooster.

Yeah, they're they're assholes. Yeah. And but they're doing it because they're trying to protect their hens. Like they don't know that you're okay. No, they just think this big fucking thing is moving around their hens. Like this giant person

Thing. They're also mean to the hint. Real mean. They're they're mean brutal. Ripping their feathers out. I'm like, I can't do it.

Yeah. They're nasty. They're,

How many do y'all have? Chickens?

We have 15. 15 or

16. Y'all name 'em.

Yes. I don't name 'em, but my daughter girls and my wife names them. But the rooster, he, we only let him got, he got to maturity and then we gave him to a friend. We're like, this motherfucker can't, no, I was gonna kill him. They're mean.

Yeah.

He attacked me. I went into the, I was like, you just gotta like, show him who's boss. And he is like, no, no, you're not boss. I'll attack you too, bitch. Yeah, exactly. He attacked me and I was like, bitch, like it. I'll fucking kill you. And so to avoid killing him, I gave him away. Well that's good because I was totally ready to kill him. Yeah. Because when I'd go in there, he'd face off against me and just leap at me and

At

Me. Every

Yeah. Might, might attack me too. And dad dealt with it. I don't know what happened to him, but dad dealt with it.

Soup. Turned with the soup. Yeah. That's the thing about roosters too. I guess he can't like just outright eat 'em. They're really tough. So if you do kill 'em, you gotta like, either slow cook 'em or turn 'em into soup.

Well we, we probably did. He didn't tell me

I had a landscaper back when I lived in LA who he used to fight chickens and he took me over his place once.

I hate that.

It was crazy.

I hate it. Yeah.

He had like a hundred, a hundred roosters.

We have done some boxers my nation has done. We're not just, we don't just help dogs. We help all animals. But dogs are focused. But like we've helped break up some chicken rings the past. It's

Kind of the crazy that it's still, it's still around.

It's awful. There's some, it's always out. Like we have a farm in Tennessee and there's a whole, this is whole farm like down the road and it's, they keep him in tiny cages. I just hate it. And every time we report him, every time they just pay the fine. You know what I mean?

Well, it's a part of the culture that's the problem. And they all gamble on it. I know he was Mexican and you know, from Mexico and he had all these friends that lived in this neighborhood where he lived in like, you might as well have been in Mexico. It was crazy. Everything was in Spanish. And when I went over his place, it's like his buddy, we went over his buddy's place. His buddy had like a hundred cages in the backyard in a pit where they would take the roosters. Awful. Yeah. And they put spurs on 'em. So they put

These like, it's so terrible. I mean, knives

On their claws.

We, we try to like, we got to be part of like some of the But when you confiscate like that many they use mean Yeah. I mean you can't Yeah. And reintroduce them into the world. Like Right. You know what I mean? They're taught to be mean. They're bred for that.

Yeah. And they'll br they'll breed champion roosters from champion other roosters.

Let's just stick to our little backyard hens. How about that?

Yeah. It's just, it's a weird thing because like their, their culture has been, they fight them and then they take the loser and they cook 'em. Yeah. And you know, he was making it seem like it was no big deal. And it was like, to them it was their gambling recreation. Yeah. They would all gather around and guys would come from long distances to bring their chickens to fight.

I hate it.

Yeah. To me it doesn't freak me out as much as dog fighting. Dog fighting drives me nuts. 'cause pit bulls are the, they're look, they're very dangerous because they have a very high parade drive and they often don't, they confuse children with other animals. They don't. But as pets, they are the most loyal. They're just, they're the most

Loving,

They're sweetest

Kind.

They love you to death. They love you so much. But there's so many bad ones and so many ones that are raised just to fight. And that part of our culture, that part of society, like the the underground dog fighting part is like, how can you do that to a dog? Like how can you do that to the best animals? Yeah. It's the scum

Of the earth is what it is. I feel like I have some friends that are huge into pit bull rescue and when they're either rehabilitated or just they get a bad rap period. Right. Like, like say any, any metro shelter you go to, it's 90% pit bulls because people are afraid. Yeah. But they're, they get such a bad reputation. But there are some amazing pities that weren't ever in the fighting greens. Right. They were just overbred and you know, you know, taking it out of a confiscation of a, of a hoarding situation or breaking up the fighting rings and it's the mama dog that's just been having puppies and like Yeah. I just wish people would at least open their minds and hearts to like, there are some amazing pities out there or pity mixes. You know, there

Are, but there are also very dangerous. I

Get it. I know they are. They

Go around other dogs. They will fight those dogs to the death.

I think you're, that's the problem. They have to be vetted. It has to be a well vetted shelter or adoption. You know.

But the problem is oftentimes you don't know their behavior until they're around other dogs. Yeah. Like I've had dogs that were great around people. Yeah. And I get them around any dog and their hackles would go up and they immediately wanted to fight. Yeah. And you're like, oh god. And then you're the asshole. 'cause your dog is like pulling on the leash and you're like, I'm sorry. Let me get 'em outta here.

Right. I know.

They, they're dangerous. They're dangerous in that regard because they really are bred to fight. And

I think it takes a special household and owner too to really Yes. Kind of handle a dog like that. Like

100%.

Our best friends, Gwen, she's in my band and her and her husband are long time pit bull rescue family. And he, they just know how to like deal with them and they come around our dogs, they're fine, everything's fine. But it's definitely an alpha male out. Like they kind of show 'em who boss right away and Yeah. And they sort of understand the food chain of the house. You know what I mean?

Yeah. There's dogs that are great dogs, but they just need a lot of attention. Like if you have a German shepherd Yeah. Or a Belgium malis, you gotta give those things something to do.

Yeah. You gotta know what kind of breed you're getting too. Yeah. Like I feel like people, I always preach, adopt, don't shop. But I still think you within the adoption, like really need to go, I'm gonna spend some time with this dog. I'm gonna talk to his foster family. I'm gonna foster it. Just to really understand what kind of breed you're getting. If you want like a lazy, cuddly thing, but still protect or kid a Pyrenees. You know what I mean? Right. Just know what you're getting. Like just understand like as my household ready. 'cause there's a lot of the, what breaks my heart the most is the like owner surrenders and the returns Yeah. At the shelters. You know what I mean? It's like Yeah. You didn't think through what you were right doing and

Then the dog already thought it had a home and now

You bring 'em in. Right. Because you did. You wanted a lazy dog and you got a cow dog and it needs to run like

Great. Pyrenees are great because they're kind of a combination of like a lab and a protector dog. Yes. They're a great little balance. Yeah. Like I have a friend who has a Pyrenees and it's like such a good dog. And he's like, listen man, if coyotes come around here, this fucking dog. Oh

Yeah. We're not, we're

Not fo them up. Yep. I go, really? And he goes like, oh yeah. Like you, you ain't never seen a change of personality like this dog when it sees a coyote,

But then they're like laid up on the couch, the legs in air. Oh, the

Sweetest. Just rub my bat under your knee.

He is the best.

Like a re like I have a golden who's he's the best. Unless you're a squirrel. And then he's, he's hell

Then he's

He then he is a demon. Yep. Exactly. He's, he's squirrel killer. But other than that he's the sweetest boy. He's just so nice to everybody. Everybody who comes over the house, like you're my best friend.

Goldens are the best.

They're so sweet.

But I love 'em all. I love 'em all. We have a chihuahua. I mean, I, I mean you, you getting a chihuahua, you know what you're getting. Yeah. Mean as hell

And nervous.

Oh my God. I mean she's 16 and blind and she still tries to bite. She don't know where you are. But she's like, but I could get you,

16 is old

And blind is a bat. But

You know. Oh my god.

Senior dog house over here.

Have you had her since she was a baby? Yep.

Wow. We doctor her from a shelter when she was like eight weeks old. Aw. We got two seniors now. But seniors I've lost. I was crazy dog lady when my husband met me and I had eight rescues, like wow. It seems crazy now. But it, I have farm and land and three were Pyrenees, two golden mixes and then three little, I don't know what's, and I've lost one every year for six years. And so after this, we have two seniors left. And my husband's like, my heart can't take this. Like he never had dogs growing up. Oh, he loves dogs. But he was like, this is awful. Like ever since we met, we've lost one. 'cause they're stair step in age and Yeah. So I'm like, I need a, my heart needs a break a little bit. It's hard.

Yeah. It's hard when they die. It's like, it's, it's so hard. So close to them. And they only lived like to

Be 15, not long enough.

15 or 13. And then it's over.

They're like, put here to show us true love. I know. They really are.

Meanwhile they're not, meanwhile what they are is like, that's wild. I'm in, we took wolves and turned them into bitches. That's what really, really what happened. Like I have a King Charles spaniel. You know one of those. He's the sweetest. That's my little

Charlie. Is that Charlie? Okay. That's

Charlie. Charlie. He is the sweetest. He's so cute. You pick him up, he just kisses your face. He's just so adorable. That was a wolf at one time.","{

Alright,

Good to see you sir.

Great to be with you Joe.

It's a perfect time to bring you on because things are getting very wild.

Yeah, there is Avi Loeb of misinformation. You know, some people said, I invented three, I atlas this object in order to distract attention from the Epstein files. Is

That what people are saying?

Yeah. And I said, look, this object is the size of Manhattan Island. It's at four and a half times the earth sun separation. If I was able to put it out there, you know, I would be more powerful than the Pope. And because we're talking about a giant object that you can see from any place on earth, you know, you can buy online a telescope that will allow you half a meter in size that will allow you to see it. It's out there, it cannot be faked.

Well, those people are fools. You can't listen to those people.

I don't listen to those I, I don't listen to many people. You know,

Initially Avi Loeb of people were dismissing your concerns and they were saying that this object is nothing but a comet and it's very normal. But then as it got closer and as we got more data, it seems like you are correct. Well this is a very unusual object.

There is something really important to recognize here, that usually when you deal with scientific matters, they have very little impact on the future of humanity. Very little. You know, if the neutrino has a little bit of a mass, doesn't really matter. You know, when we discovered the Higgs boon, the biggest impact was to confirm some idea we had back in the sixties. And you know, obviously that affected, you know, the, those people who got the Nobel Prize. But most of us continued as if nothing happened. However, here, if we ever encounter alien technology, everything will change. It'll affect the financial markets, it'll affect politics in a major way. So my point is simple. This is different than other scientific matters. And the intelligence agencies know very well that events with very small probability have to be considered seriously because they have, they could have major implications. Just think about October 7th, the Israeli intelligence agencies had a theory that the Hamas will do nothing. And they got data that indicated something is going on out there, but they dismissed it because of their theory. Now because as a result of their mistake, which was clearly a blunder, Avi Loeb of people died on both sides for that. This could have been avoided if they were to consider a Black swan event, an event that you put a small probability for it happening. But you look at anomalies in the data and say, look, the implications are so huge we have to consider it. And you know, this idea was already considered by the philosopher mathematician, blessed Pascal. He talked about God and he said, look, of course you might think that God doesn't exist. The probability for that is small, but the implications, if God exists, the implications are so huge that we have to discuss it. That was the argument Pascal's wager and the intelligence agencies know that. Believe me, the Israeli intelligence agencies will not make that mistake again. Now, here comes an object from outside the solar system and it shows anomalies. The scientists would say, we should be as careful as possible at talking about anything other than a rock. Now they say that when they know that we launched humanity, launched Avi Loeb of space junk, you know, Avi Loeb of technological objects to space. And we also know that there are a hundred billion stars like the sun in the Milky Way galaxy alone. Most of them formed billions of years before the sun. And there are billions of earth sun analogs. Now we all believe that we came out of a soup of chemicals. You know, that's the scientific narrative of how human intelligence came on this earth. And so it's quite likely that, you know, we are not the first one. Sorry to break the news. Elon Musk was probably not the most accomplished space entrepreneur since the big bank 13.8 billion years ago. And therefore we should consider the possibility that things like us existed long before us. And you can ask the question, how long does it take our own technology, the Voyager spacecraft that we launched out of the solar system, how long does it take it to move to the opposite side of the Milky Way galaxy? You know, thousands of light years away takes less than a billion years. And that means that all these civilizations that had their history initiated billions of years before ours could have done it. And all we need to do as responsible scientist is to check if among all the rocks that come from outside of our backyard are really rocks. Or maybe one of these objects might be a tennis ball that was thrown by a neighbor. And the reason I say that is, you know, we live at our home, at our, at the on earth next to the sun. We look around us in the cosmic street and we see Avi Loeb of houses just like ours. There are billions of them, probably Now my colleagues, those scientists who think traditionally, they say, well you know, microbes came to earth very early, therefore they must be everywhere. So let's define our highest priority, searching for microbes on other houses in our cosmic street. And I say, good, you can do that from the vantage point of your home. You can look through the window and search for microbes in your neighbor's yards. But you would need to put $10 billion to develop a big enough instrument that would be able to detect the chemical fingerprints of microbes, you know, on exoplanets. And think about the possibility that there was actually, there is a resident in one of those houses. You know that resident might show up in your front door at some point, or you might see an object that arrives to your backyard or your mailbox from that per

Resident. A black swan

Event. A black swan event. Or you might see some construction project in from a distance that might be easier to detect than microbes. So we should hedge our bets. You know, we should invest billions of dollars on both fronts. At the moment. The scientific community is willing to allocate more than $10 billion to searching for microbes. But no recommendation is made to allocate any federal funding to the search for intelligence. And I say that that is an oversight.

Now they have found evidence of microbes on Mars, correct?

Well, it's not conclusive. We need to bring materials back. It's called sample return. And NASA has plans, we need to bring a sample back to earth so that in our laboratories we can do isotope analysis and make sure that whatever signatures we see on the rocks there that do look as if they were made by microbes. Because we know that Mars had an atmosphere like the Earth. By the way, Mars may have had life before the earth because it's a smaller body. So it has a bigger surface area for its mass. The mass of the object tells you how much heat it can retain from the formation process. And then the surface area tells you how fast it can. Cool. And Mars could have cooled faster than the Earth. So life may have started on Mars actually 'cause it had rivers, lakes, oceans of water. And it could have been actually delivered to earth. You know, we might be all martians. And when Elon Musk, you know, considers going to Mars, it might be the second trip around. We might be going back to our childhood home because there were tiny astronauts inside rocks that were chipped off the surface of Mars that arrived to Earth and seeded the earth with life as we know it. Panspermia. Yeah. And, and in fact, you know, we can find out if we get this material back to earth as NASA is planning to do, hopefully within a decade then we can make sure that these were microbes. And perhaps we can infer whether the building blocks of these microbes are similar to the ones we have here on earth. Whether the D-N-A-R-N-A kind of process took place in both places. This

Episode is brought to you by the farmer's dog. I think we can all agree that eating highly processed food for every meal isn't optimal. So why is processed food the status quo for dog food? Because that's what kibble is, an ultra processed food. But a healthy alternative exists. The farmer's dog, they make fresh food for dogs. And what does it look like? Real meat and vegetables that are gently cooked to retain vital nutrients and help avoid any of the bad stuff that comes with ultra processing. And it's not just random ingredients thrown together. Their food is formulated by on staff board certified vet nutritionists. These people are experts on dog nutrition and they're all in on fresh food. The farmer's dog also does something unique. They portion out the food to your dog's nutritional needs. This ensures that you don't overfeed them. Making weight management easy research shows that dogs kept at a healthy weight can live up to two and a half years longer.

Have you ever done any research on the structural anomalies that are on Mars, particularly the right angles that appear to be a square, this enormous structure?

Yeah, I've, I've seen the data. It's not conclusive, but it's intriguing 'cause both Mars and the moon have no atmosphere right now. So what happens on Earth is that when a, an object roughly the size of a person, you know, or smaller goes through the atmosphere, it burns up, creates a fireball just like an atomic explosion. You know, and actually you have an object of other em meter colliding with Earth every year, every year there is an atomic explosion size fireball in our atmosphere. It's not reported in the news 'cause it happens pretty high at, at an altitude of 50 kilometers. So it doesn't do anything. And mo you know, 71% of the earth is covered by oceans. But yes, so these meat meteors and you know, they, they are quite important. O obviously we know that the dinosaurs 66 million years ago were extinguished by a giant impact by a a, an asteroid the size of Manhattan Island. And we are aware by the way, that such an impact could endanger us. And that's why the US Congress tasked NASA to find all objects that come close to earth with a size bigger than a football field, about 140 meters, so that we avoid the fate of the dinosaurs. So we think we are smart, we can see these rocks coming, but just imagine alien technology, it'll not follow a path that you expect if it has some intelligence in it. And that's a risk that was never attended to. And I wrote a white paper to the United Nations and to the International astronomical Union to develop a strategy for monitoring Interstellar objects, objects that come from outside the solar system like three I Atlas that could that show anomalies that could potentially be technological in origin.

The, the structures on Mars. Like what, what do you think when you look at them, when you see that one that looks like

It's square? I think it's very intriguing. Both Mars and the moon have no atmosphere. So the objects that come into them do not burn up, as I mentioned before about earth. And therefore they serve as museums. Okay? So any, you know, space junk that might have landed on Mars over the past 2 billion years would not have burned in the atmosphere. It would've landed. And, and, and we can, we need to check the surface even if we know that, you know, there wasn't any civilization out there over the past 2 billion years. 'cause conditions are really harsh, right? The Mars may have collected technological debris from other civilizations because it would stay on the surface. It's just like a museum.

This, this is an enormous structure. It's at least they think, I think they think 300 meters, but yeah,

But that's not enormous because quite

A bit longer. Three

I atlas the size of three atlas, right, is at least five kilometers in diameter. And I derived it in a paper a couple of weeks ago because we know that it's losing mass. So, and, and it's mostly from the side that is facing the sun. And you would've gotten some recoil as a result of that in the opposite direction, just like a rocket. And I used together with two colleagues, 4,000 data points from 227 observatories around the earth of three a atlas that monitored its motion across the sky. And, and we were able to say that the trajectory is sculpted only by gravity. There is no evidence for this recoil. And that means that the object is very massive. And I derived the value of 33 billion tons, a huge thing. Which if you take solid density, it means it's more than five kilometers in diameter. So when you mention a few hundred meters, that's nothing. Right? And this object, by the way, was discovered just over the past decade of, of serving the sky. You know, so who knows how much debris collected on the surface of Mars or the moon because there are good museums, you know, for, for, and by the way, I see that as their most important value. Let me just say one thing about my fundamental point of view, okay? You know, each of us would live for about a hundred years if we are lucky, right? That's the kind of, it's pretty depressing, right? 'cause there there is so much we, we would like to know and we have only a hundred years. So, and you know, that already tells you that you need to be modest and humble. 'cause you don't have Avi Loeb of time, right? Right. So why engage in conflicts? Why reduce the, the lifespan of other people, you know, in wars? It, it makes no sense all of this, right? You have limited time. Let's just use it for something constructive. Anyway, we are born on this rock, which is just three millions of the mass of the sun. It's leftover material from the formation process of the sun. Some debris was left over in a disc and the earth was made out of that. That's it. And it's just a speck of material, nothing significant. And this earth was moving around the sun 4.54 billion times before the Vatican even existed. And why do I say the Vatican? Because the Vatican put Galileo Galilean house arrest when he said, I don't think everything moves around the earth. I see some moons through my telescope. You know, I, I see some moons around Jupiter and they don't seem to revolve around the earth, they revolve around Jupiter, therefore the earth is not at the center. So they put him in house arrest today, they would've, you know, canceled him on social media. And, and my point is, that's the first sign that, you know, humans are, they want to think that it's all about them. You know, like, right. And it's not surprising, but the Vatican admitted their mistake in 1992. They issued an official letter saying Galeo was right. That was 350 years after he died. And you know, it's the worst public relations affair that you can have to admit that you were wrong for, for, you know, like 350 years.",,,"Avi Loeb, PhD, is a theoretical physicist and Frank B.

"l, nothing significant. And this earth was moving around the sun 4.54 billion times before the Vatican even existed. And why do I say the Vatican?

And it's not surprising, but the Vatican admitted their mistake in 1992. They issued an official letter saying Galeo was right. That was 350 years after he died. And you know, it's the worst public relations affair that you can have to admit that you were wrong for, for, you know, like 350 years. And how could they have avoided that? Very simply, if they said we have more money than Galileo, we will be build an even bigger telescope to figure out the truth. And we would prove him wrong. And then they would've found that he was right. And so then they would've corrected course shortly

After, or they would've put more people under house arrest. That's probably what they would've

Done. Yeah. So, so my point is, it's really important in cases like this, or three I atlas, it's really important to get as much data as possible, right? 'cause once you reach a certain threshold, you can't shove anomalies under the carpet of traditional thinking. The way that my colleagues do, just to give you an example, the first Interstellar object was ua. Okay? And it was discovered 2017. And it was really strange 'cause you know, the, it was shaped like a pancake based on the all the data we have. And, and it was pushed away from the sun by some mysterious force without showing any evaporation, no gas or dust around it. What did these conservative comet experts say? Most recently, just, just in December, 2024, there was a paper of them saying it's a comet, it's a dark comet. In other words, a comet where you can't see the cometary tale around it. So it's just like experts, you know, specializing in zebras. And they go to the zoo and they see an elephant. So then they say, oh, the elephant is a zebra without stripes. And I say, no, it's a completely different animal. You know, a spacecraft would appear differently than a rock, than a comet because it'll not have a a a, a cometary tale. It could be propelled by something else. So, so let me go back to the big picture that I mentioned before. So we live on this earth moving around the sun. And my colleagues in academia, you know, one thing I often say is common sense is not common in academia because my colleagues in academia know very well about the story of Galileo. They know very well about the possibility of black swans. And they say it's an extraordinary claim to imagine something like us as smart as we are near another star. And I say, no, it's an ordinary claim. Why would you think it's extraordinary? And by the way, if you decide not to collect evidence, not to look for it, then you will not find it. So I say, and you know, I say extraordinary evidence requires extraordinary funding. You really need to put resources to find the evidence by not attending to, to this possibility. You'll not by not imagining this. And by the way, I much prefer to listen to imaginative science fiction writers, you know, first class because they're much more interesting than second class scientists who don't have an imagination. And they don't, they not only have a problem with discussing alien intelligence, they also have a problem with whoever discusses it. And they will try to suppress that voice. And I think it makes no sense whatsoever. 'cause the public really cares about it. You know, my essays on medium.com, they get a few million readers a month. Now the public cares about it, the public fund science. Therefore scientists should attend to this question. Are we alone? It's the most romantic question in science. You know, it's like, so, so just to finish my big picture before we get to, to more. So then, you know, we live on this planet, everyone says, okay, we are not at the center of the universe, but we might be the only intelligent species out there.

Again, we need the next Coan revolution, the next galion revolution to realize that there is a smarter kid on the block. Okay? And it's just like the experience of my daughters. On the first day to the kindergarten, they at home, they thought that they're at the center of the, of the universe because they had the, you know, the, their learning was based on a, a, a data set that was limited to home. It's just like LLMs, you know, artificial intelligence systems that learn from their data sets and they had limited environment. And then when they went to the kindergarten, they realize their kids just like them. Some are smarter. So we are yet to mature in that sense. And that's the big picture. Now, why is it so important for the future of humanity? Because, you know, the earth is not, would not exist forever, by the way. When people talk about climate, global climate change and so forth, they don't realize, you know, the issue is not the earth. The issue is humanity. The future of humanity. And you know, the earth itself would be very likely based on detailed calculations, it'll be engulfed by the sun in 7.6 billion years. And here is something that you won't find much discussed. The moon, because of the friction on the envelope of the sun will crash back to earth. And then the earth will move all the way to the center of the sun. Nothing will be left, no monument will survive 7.6 billion years ago into the future. And we have an obligation if we want to be remembered on cosmic in cosmic history, you know, we have an obligation not to go to Mars. That's not really a, a great vision, you know, going to Mars is just like, you know, you have a, a group of chimpanzees living in, in the jungle, you know, in, in a, you know, on some trees and they have some bananas and so forth. And then one of the chimpanzees looks far, far away into the horizon and says, oh, look up there, there is another region that that we can go to. And, and it actually, it's clear that there are no bananas there. So the same is about Mars. You know, like Elon says, let's go to Mars to save humanity, but it's actually not a great place to be on.

Yeah, you gotta start somewhere. You have to start somewhere if you wanna populate a planet.

So here's my point, okay?

Here's your point.

It makes much more sense for us to invest in building a platform in space that can accommodate humans, not rely on another rock that happens to be near us with much worse conditions. It's a desert, no atmosphere. So let's build a space platform, go on it and make sure that it's safe for humans to live for long periods of time. We can produce artificial gravity by rotation. Now you say, well it'll cost Avi Loeb of money, but we are spending $2.4 trillion every year on military budgets. If we were just to change our priorities and say we want to build no a spaceship, an analogy to NOKs arc to save humanity from the great flood or catastrophe that will happen on earth. You build such, you, you put a fraction of this $2.4 trillion a year. And I'm willing to bet that within this century, our engineers, architects, scientists, if you put a level of funding of a trillion dollars a year for the next dec several decades, we will come up with a concept that can accommodate humans in space much better than Mars can.

Okay, I wanna get back to Mars because the structures on Mars. Why, why would you think that they came from space debris rather than a prior civilization?

Because, well, Mars,

Let's take a look at it first. Jamie, will you pull up those images? So what's fascinating about the images is the right angles, right? Like that one that you Yeah, that's good. Yeah. Like that's kind of crazy, isn't it? It is. And that doesn't strike me as something that landed there from space. It looks like a structure. It's just, it's too even. Yeah,

Well it could be that. It could be, it could be if the evolution of intelligence on Mars was accelerated by factor of two, you know, that's not a big factor, factor of two. Right? Meaning that helped intelligence a arose on Mars, right. 2 billion years after it formed, rather than in the case of the Earth 4.5 or so. Right? And you know, one thing I really want to do is if I ever have a say or or go to Mars, I would like to visit those caves, the lava tubes in Mars because they're protected from the surface. You know, bombardment by cosmic rays and all kinds of things happening. The ultra radiation. So in those caves, I want to check if there are any prehistoric paintings or any technological objects there. I completely agree with you. A factor of two is not a big deal. And you can ask also whether on earth there was a sophisticated technological civilization before us that somehow, you know, either through self-inflicted wounds or because of a natural catastrophe disappeared.

Well there's Avi Loeb of people that think that, especially now that they're looking at the pyramids and these structures that appear to be underneath the pyramids, that they're examining those Italian scientists that have found these structures that are up to two kilometers deep. Right? There's some wild stuff in Egypt.

Well, I want to see that data. I haven't seen the paper itself, I just saw reports about it. But definitely on earth as well. And the problem of earth is that documented human histories is only 8,000 years old. Right? And 8,000 years, you know, is just a millionth of the age of the milky. It's nothing. But

Are you, are you including things like Gobekli Tepe in that 'cause that's 11,000

Plus? Well, so that yeah, but it's not really documented in written form, you know, like Right. So I'm talking about take graphs though. Yeah. But you are correct that our knowledge of what happened on earth is really limited. 'cause the human species existed for a few million years and we have documentation at the level of 10,000 year, if you go back to that, it would be 11,005. Not Avi Loeb, not much, but

Yeah. Well the, the issue is actual evidence. Right? Exactly. There's just not Avi Loeb of evidence. Avi Loeb, Avi Loeb of evidence just gets swallowed by the earth. Exactly. Especially over long periods of time. Which is why it's so fascinating looking at that thing on Mars. Because if there was any kind of life that was capable of building structures on Mars, it had to be a long time ago. Like when was Mars there? There's a, a, a bunch of theories, maybe you can help me. Like what do you think is the predominant theory that explains the lack of atmosphere on Mars? Do you think it was an impact?

No, Mars is a less massive planet than the Earth and therefore it has less gravitational grip on its atmosphere. And as to why the atmosphere was lost, there are various ideas, you know, it may have to do with an eruption on the sun that removed it, or the magnetic field, the, the lack of strong enough magnetic field to retain the atmosphere. We don't know for sure. But we know it happened about two to two and a half billion years ago at the middle of its life.

Can I ask you this? Yeah. At two and a half billion years, was it closer to the sun?

No, no, no. It was roughly at the same place. Exactly the same distance.

Yeah. Okay.

Yeah. And,

And then so two and a half billion years ago, it lost its atmosphere. Yes. So if it did have life, that life would have to, so we would have to be looking at something that's literally two plus billion years old. Yes. Yes. The remnants of a structure, which also seems kind of unlikely. Right. It also seems like there probably wouldn't be much there.

I actually did a calculation, the biggest risk for anything on the surface is all these impacts by asteroids. And I calculated that.

And micro medias everything. Right? 'cause there's nothing stopping. That's

Right. That's right. And I calculated the amount of energy over a few billion years that was deposited on the surface of Mars. Yeah. Is equivalent to, you know, hundreds of Hiroshima type nuclear explosions per square kilometer. It's really huge. Right. And because you're integrating over billions of years. So

That square probably wouldn't be there anymore.

Well there could be some relics that somehow stick, you know, like it depends what it was originally, you know? Right. If the EM Empire State Building, you know, even

After, if it was enormous and made completely outta stone like the pyramids, maybe that's what would be left of

It. Maybe. Maybe. I think we should be definitely open-minded and guided by evidence. Right. That's the key.

Well that's what's interesting is 'cause that is evidence. That

Is evidence we should go there, you know, clear the dust and see if, if it's just a rock that happened to be shaped like that, I mean you could have rocks that are shaped like that.

Let, let's bring it back to this. Is it three AI atlas? Is that No, three

I Atlas.

Three I Atlas.

So three means it's the third object identified by survey telescopes over the past eight years. We didn't have the technology before that. And so we just don't know how much traffic there is of inter.

Right. We missed Avi Loeb. So

We had, you know, the first survey telescope that found Oua was pan stars in Hawaii. And the reason it was constructed is because the US Congress tasked NASA to find 90% of all objects bigger than a football field passing close to earth. These are potential killer asteroids that can destroy a region on earth. We want to protect the earth. So we want to know about them. Right. And they asked NASA and the National Science Foundation to search, you know, to build observatories that will search for such objects. And that's why Pan stars was established and then it saw a near earth object. So they flagged it for that reason. And they realized it's moving too fast to be bound by gravity to the sun. And that was ua. And then it looked, looked weird. Now I had no agenda. I was working on cosmology at the time. You know, I was working on black holes. I was the founding director of the Black Hole Initiative at Harvard. And Stephen Hawking had Passover at my home in 2016. This object was discovered a year later. And I said, well, okay, that's interesting. But it has anomalies. You know, it it, the amount of brightness coming from it by reflecting sunlight changes by a factor of 10 as it's stumbling. That's really strange. And I started getting more and more into the anomalies. And I noticed,

So you had no, previous to that, you had no real connection to the UAP phenomenon. Nothing. Zero.

Zero.

So you're just basing entirely on the data that you were getting from Yeah. And how do you say it? Ua

Ua

Ua.

And you know, I am driven by curiosity. I'm no different than the the kid that I was, you know, I grew up on a farm and people who knew me back then say I didn't change. I'm not willing to change what I say just for political benefit or for just to be liked. But I don't have any social media accounts. I don't care about that. But when something,

Thank God somebody,

Well, it's thanks to my wife, not God. My wife said, you should not have any footprint on search. So she's really wise. She's wise. And that was a dec more than a decade ago. Wow. She

She spotted the problem real early.

Yeah, yeah, yeah.

This episode is brought to you by Netflix. Catherine Bigelow, the Oscar winning director of the Hurt Locker. And zero dark 30 takes you deep inside the world of US government and military. A world most of us never see. But that impacts us all. It's an authentic look at how America might respond to a nuclear attack showing the human side of impossible decisions under unimaginable stress. A house of dynamite now streaming only on Netflix.

And now with ai, we're talking about social media on steroids. Yeah. It's, it's really bad, by the way, the main problem with social, with AI that I see is not so much that, you know, they will bring calamity on their own. It's that they will drive people to do crazy stuff. So they will manipulate the human mind in ways that will make us the robots. You know, it'll not need access to the physical world. It'll control the minds of people in a way that will create Avi Loeb of damage. And we see that already.

It's already happening. Exactly. With, with AI using

That,

The biggest risk box on social media.

And nobody is attending to that. And the question is, how do we suppress the amazing polarization that we see in society where, you know, bullets are being shot. Yeah. And I, I really worry about it. 'cause and and so humans may actually bring their own doom by, by self-inflicted wounds because AI manipulates their minds.

I think you're right. I think in that regard, I think people need to stop using it. I really do. I just think it's not good for

You. That's what I'm doing.

I just think,

I'm not using AI at all, by the way.

You can use it sometimes, but I, I, I treat it like a glass of wine. Like don't drink wine all day.

You know, I'm, it's not good for, you know, I'm, I'm working with students and every now and then a student delivers a paper to me to look at. And I realized some of the references do not exist. 'cause I know the literature, you know, that I ask the student, well, what is this? I've never heard about this paper. And the student says, oh, sorry. And it turns out the AI just took names of authors and faked Yeah. Make

Fake

Things. Yeah. And the same thing within the paper itself. There are statements that are clearly because the student was using ai. I'm really worried about that because the young people are not reading, right. They don't read history. So they go to protests that make no sense. Right. They don't, and people say, oh, that, that is always the youthful thing to do. But no, no, no. This one is triggered by misinformation. It's triggered and it's organized lack and it's organized. Exactly. Yes. And so that's one thing. But then they don't go to primary sources to figure out the truth. They don't have critical thinking. And I really feel that this is a big risk because, you know, AI is getting more intelligent, but, but humans that use AI are getting dumber. Right. They don't think so. I think that the, you know, the AI would supersede the cognitive abilities of humans sooner than expected because humans are getting dumber. I mean, I see that. I see.

No, I I I don't think people are necessarily getting dumber, but I think they're getting lazy. Lazy because of this. I think the human,

I get Avi Loeb of

Is exactly the same. I think they need to be taught how to use it. I

Think, well, I get Avi Loeb of emails saying, I collaborated with my favorite AI app and here is what it said. And

Yeah. But I think we need to teach people how to use it because it's a new thing. And that, that, I think that's where Avi Loeb of the problem comes from. That people are using it in, in a substitution for learning. You know? And, but you instead can learn from it. Right. But you've gotta use it in that way.

So there are two existential risk in our future. One is artificial intelligence, ai, the second one is alien intelligence. Right. Also ai. And the question is, which one would arrive first? Let's,

Let's go back to, I don't want one more time. Ua ua, okay. I don't wanna screw it up. How large was that?

That was, was the size of a football field.

Okay.

So of all a hundred meters

Small in comparison to three

ILAs. Oh yeah, that's my point. That three I Atlas is a million times more massive. At least a million times more massive than ua. Right. And I immediately, as it was discovered, you know, it was July 1st and my wife asked me to go on vacation to Aruba two days later. And as I was going on the plane and as I arrived there, I realized, wait, that doesn't make sense. 'cause we should have seen millions of omu MUAs before we saw this one. You know, it's so big. And I also realized there is not enough rocky material per unit volume in Interstellar space to deliver such a giant rock into the inner solar system within a period of a decade. You would expect it at the very optimistic scenario where you package all the material into objects that are five kilometer in diameter, you would imagine once per 10,000 years. So I wrote immediately a scientific paper. My wife was not happy that, you know, on our vacation, I was sitting on my computer, but I just couldn't resist it. Right. And by the way, this paper I submitted for publication, that was July 3rd or something. And then the editor said, oh, the paper is fine. But you have a concluding sentence at the end where you say, well, unless the object is smaller than estimated, maybe it was targeting the inner source. That was my solution. To say, you know, one way out of this dilemma of why is it so big, is if it was targeting the inner soce by design. And indeed the trajectory is aligned with the plane of the planets around the sun to within five degrees. The chance for that at random is one in 500. Okay. And it's moving in a retrograde trajectory opposite to the motion of the planets, which is ideal for it to release mini probes that will get into the planets, it gets close to Mars, it gets close to Jupiter. It goes on the opposite side of the sun relative to earth when it's closest to the sun. And that's the time when a spacecraft could do a maneuver to take advantage of the sun's gravitational assist. You know, all of these are interesting indications that may imply that some intelligence designed the trajectory. So I had one sentence at the end of the paper saying maybe the trajectory was designed. And the editor said, no, no, no. The paper will not get published unless you remove that sentence. Wow. So now when you a when you listen to comment experts that say, well, this claim or that claim was never published in a peer review journal, guess what? They are the editors or the reviewers who are blocking the discussion on possibilities. And I think it's inappropriate, especially in the case of alien technology, because it could be a black swan event, it could be something that affects the future of humanity. And we, if we behave, you know, arrogant, very conservatively, we might not last very long.

Well it's also arrogant. It's,

It's

Arrogant. Yeah. Th this object is ha shows that there's no iron.

Oh no. And it, so yeah. So then the composition of the plume of gas around, so

This is, this is before you knew about the composition. That's right. That you wrote

This paper. Okay. Exactly. And

So, so as time is going on, you are being shown to be correct.

Well, we found more, more anomalies.

More anomalies, more. But this is not a normal thing.

Not a normal thing. So for one thing, there was a glow that looks like an extended feature, and everyone said, oh, that's a tail, that's the signature of a comet. Right? And I said, wait a minute, it, it's pointing towards the sun. It's not pointing away from the sun. Usually commentary tails are made of dust and gas, which is pushed back away from the sun by the radiation and the solar wind, you know? And so this one was pointed towards the sun, not away from the sun. And the question is why? And actually I calculated that, you know, it appeared very clearly in the sharpest image we had from the Hubble Space Telescope, which showed an elongation by a factor of two towards the sun. But we were looking at it like a cigar. We were looking almost along the cigar long axis within 10 degrees of the object sun axis. So we were looking almost edge on, and I calculate if you were to correct for that, this would be a feature that is 10 times longer than it is wide, you know, and, and that means it's like a jet. So the object was, had a jet in front of it towards the sun. The question is why? And you know, the comet experts ignored it and just said, well, you know, comets are strange. You know, the, who knows. But my point is, this is a blind date of in Interstellar proportions. And my advice on blind dates is not to speak or say what you think this is, but to observe the other side. You know, the best way to respond to a blind date is to observe the other side. Don't speak, just observe the other side. Because it may be different than what you think. And maybe, you know, on one of the dates you will have a serial killer on the other side.

Oh boy. Now explain if you could, how we know the composition of this thing,

Right? So we can figure out composition of a plume of gas by taking a spectrum of it, which means you basically have some kind of a prism that breaks, you know, that a light with different wavelengths is bent at different angles. And so you spread the light into the different colors. And if you do that, you, you can find the fingerprints, the spectral fingerprints of specific atoms or molecules because each atom or molecule has transitions. I, I actually teach, I taught it just two days ago in a class that I teach that is mandatory obligatory at the Harvard Astronomy Department where I was chair for a decade, you know, like between 2011, 2020. So this is the mandatory class. And I, I just thought how, you know, spectral lines emitted by atoms and molecules just two days ago. So this is a very well known thing and we know the, the wavelengths of those and, and we use them to identify the composition. You know, we know which atoms produced these spectral lines, the fingerprints. It's just like fingerprints. Okay? And, and so what was found, you know, and that's by multiple teams. There are three papers on that we found nickel Avi Loeb of nickel, but no very little iron at first. No iron whatsoever. Now usually in all the comets in the past from the solar system and also from Interstellar space, there is one comet borisov that was found. It's the second Interstellar object which looked just like a familiar comet. I had nothing to say about that one. It looked like a comet behaved like a comet. It was a comet, but it had similar abundances of nickel and iron. The only place where we found before much more nickel than iron is in alloys that we produce industrially, for example, for aerospace applications. Nickel alloys have Avi Loeb of nickel, no iron. So maybe the skin of this objectives is industrially produced. That's, that was my suggestion. But what the authors of these papers said is maybe nature is capable of going through the same chemical pathway of producing nickel without iron as we do in our industries. So they made the conjecture that this carbonyl pathway, which is well known in the industry world, carbonyl is the pathway in the name of the pathway. They said, well maybe this carbon in pathway happens in nature. We have never seen it before. But that is their explanation.

Hmm. Is it possible that nature could construct some sort of a nickel alloy?

No, it's not an alloy, it's just that, well,

Something, some,

Somehow the nickel gets released, the iron gets suppressed. Nobody would argue that, you know, you could sort of separate nickel from iron 'cause they're produced together in exploding stars. Right? And in fact, the composition of the sun has more iron than nickel, 10 times more by, by mass. And so we just don't know, as in the case of this jet that I was mentioning, which recently turned into a tail now over the month of September. And also, you know, why was it changing? Structure is not clear. There are lots of anomalies. There was also a very negative polarization of the light. And also two weeks ago, I realized the arrival direction of three a atlas was within nine degrees of the wow signal that was detected in 1977. Right? Which was an enigmatic powerful radio signal that definitely came from outside of this earth. We don't know from where it was coming from, a source that was approaching the sun and the chance of it aligning with the arrival direction of three A atlas is 0.6%. And I just said, well that's interesting. 'cause three atlas was at the distance of three light days from the earth at that time. You know, and you just need about the output of a nuclear reactor on earth, gigawatt or so to produce such a radio signal. By the way, Voyager, right, as of now is one light day away from Earth. Just think about it. Ah, one light day are, you know, the farthest spacecraft we ever launched is one light day away and the size of the Milky Way galaxy. We are talking about tens of thousands of light years. So one day out of tens of thousands of years, that's the difference between the distance that we managed to bridge so far compared to another civilization that may have sent something to our backyard.

Right? Now, have we ever observed things in the past that have changed their tail like this?

So there are fake, gone

Fake from a jet to a tail.

This is called an anti tail when it's pointing towards the sun. There were optically illusions in a situation where, you know, the, there is a tail which is pushed away from the sun by radiation and the solar wind. But you are observing it as the earth goes through the orbital plane of, of, of, of this, of object, of this comet. And you are seeing it from a perspective that it looks as if the tail is pointed at the sun. But in fact it's, it's just a perspective thing. It's a optical illusion. And there were cases like that that that was seen. But as far as I know, none seen in a situation where it's clear and in three I atlas it was very far from the sun and earth and we saw it towards the sun.",,,"Avi Loeb, PhD, is a theoretical physicist and Frank B.

And there were cases like that that that was seen. But as far as I know, none seen in a situation where it's clear and in three I atlas it was very far from the sun and earth and we saw it towards the sun. There cannot be an optical illusion under the circumstances 'cause it was approaching both the earth and the sun roughly at the same direction. So I'm not aware of another, but most importantly, you should look at the response of the comet expert community to that anomaly. They say, well, comets are strange. We don't know. Maybe it's, these are dust particles that are very big so they don't get pushed back much. But then how do you scatter sunlight? Usually you need particles that have a size of the odor of the wavelength of the light that is being scattered. That's the most efficient process. And when you have dust particles, the ones that have, you know, sub micrometer dimensions are dominating the scattering of sunlight. So why in this case, you will have only big ones that are not getting pushed back. It could be fragments of ice that are scattering the sunlight that have nothing to do with dust, but those fragments of ice get, get evaporated. And so they don't have enough time to turn back. You know, I wrote two papers on that trying to explain it. But my point is, many scientists are not curious. You, you would find it surprising. Why are they not curious? Why are they not willing to consider alternative explanations to what is commonly thought? And it's because they're afraid of taking any risk. You know, and I came from a background where I worked in cosmology trying to figure out puzzles. Like most of the matter in the universe is of a substance that we don't know what it is. You know, we, we call it dark matter. It's just to, to reflect our ignorance. You know, Nobel Prize were awarded for people who ified how much dark matter there is, how much dark energy there is. These are constituents whose nature is unknown. And just think about it, giving a Nobel Prize to people who just said how ignorant we are. We don't know what these things are. Ordinary matter might makes just 5% of all the matter in the universe and in this culture of cosmology, you know, I worked in for three decades, it was, you know, completely common to propose ideas, to explain anomalies. I mean the dark matter is an anomaly, right? You don't know what it is. And people were rewarded for coming up with ideas, imaginative ideas that can be tested experimentally. That's the way you make progress. You don't know something, you are putting on the table possibilities. And then you motivate observers or experimentalists to figure out which one is the correct one. And that was the culture. And I think of it as the culture of chess players. Okay? Okay. Trying to figure out things. When I get to work on comets, you know, asteroids these objects and consider imaginative possibilities to explain their anomalies the way I did in the context of cosmology, I encounter, you know, a a a culture of mud wrestlers. Mud wrestlers. It's different from chess players, right? And you know, I don't want to mud wrestle. I don't want to get dirty. I don't respond to the, I learned my lesson with ua. I don't respond to those people because once we collect, I just want as much evidence as possible so that they would not be able to shove the anomalies under the carpet of traditional thinking. That's my motivation, right? So I'm inspiring a debate right now and there is a huge interest in that debate. So that we will collect as much data as possible so that by the end of the day we'll figure out what our dating partner is if it happens to be a rock, you know, on the other side of the table, you go on a date and you see a rock. So be it. If it's something else that has huge implications, right? And therefore we,

Like why, why are they averse to risk and why do they, not just, why are they not just averse to risk, but why they're attacking you for proposing what seems to me to be a reasonable alternative considering the possibilities given all the planets and stars that we know are out there?

Well, I got a hint for the answer to your question. When I wrote the first paper on ua right? I suggested it might be technological,

Right?

And the paper got accepted for publication within three days record. The reviewer said this is a great idea because it's consistent with all the data we have. It's, it's most likely a flat object and therefore it could be pushed by reflecting sunlight, which was my proposal. Then the media came to my door and people started asking me Avi Loeb of questions I got, you know, I I, I got well known at that point. The attacks, the personal attacks started. So, right. So it's jealousy. Jealousy, Avi Loeb of jealousy, it's, and you know, but I can tell you that I learned my lesson.

You can't respond.

I just ignore it. Yeah. And let me give you a few anecdotes of what happened to me this week. Just this week, okay.

He's pretty smart of him, right, because that's definitely gonna get you Avi Loeb of attention.

Yeah. So he just sent it to me this morning. The they, this is in the shop where they put all these things on it and tomorrow I'm going to drive it.

What is Comet Lemon in the back? Oh,

That's just another comment. So he

Just put Oh he is like a Comet fan, this guy.

Yeah. By the way I told him that the fastest moving race car is 600 times slower than three. I Atlas 600 times. So you know. Wow. It's a compliment to me to be featured on his car. But three I Atlas doesn't care much 'cause it's already moving 600 times faster than his car can move, you know? But let's move

To that is cool though. So that, so

This is tomorrow,

That image though, that's you with a spinning world, right? That's the globe,

Yeah. And my name, so the car is called Avi Log now.

Nice. Congratulations.

Yeah. Can we congrat to the next image? I'll show you another.

So you're very excited about this. I like it.

Yeah. So this is an, an image taken two days ago in my office at Harvard, I, again, I was contacted out of the blue by an artist, a very distinguished artist, accomplished named Greg Wyatt in New York City, who donated two sculptures made of Bronze of Galileo. You see them in the front. They were delivered to my office just a few days ago. And in the background, you see what colors that he made, each of them, there are 51 of them that he don. All of this, he donated to me at no cost. He wants it to be displayed on in my office, because these watercolors display famous scientists, PI that pioneered new frontiers. And he includes a statement from each of these scientists, which are really educational for the students and postdocs that work with me. I should tell you, I got an email from a US Air Force pilot. His daughter, Ariana said to him, he, he wrote me an email and said, because of you, my daughter wants to become a scientist. Now she saw you on television and now she only speaks about aliens. You know, two days later I speak with a reporter from the London Times and he puts out his report and says, I read the report for half an hour to my kids. And they told me they want to become scientists. And you know, this is a guy, another thing that, there are two things that are missed by my colleagues. One, it's an opportunity to excite the, the kids to get into science. You know, that's an amazing, I mean, when we discovered the Higgs boon, you know, it was an important confirmation of an idea that came in the sixties. The Nobel Prize was awarded. But I bet you that the daughter, Ariana, the daughter of the US Air Force Pilot would not be inspired to become a scientist because it's very abstract here. The con there is a connection. So that's one thing that is missed. And of course, the second one is, here is a subject that the public cares about and the public fund science. So we should attend to that. Of course, it's our obligation as scientist, of course. Why, you know, I always, since I started science, which was by chance by the way, I wanted always to become a, a, a philosopher. But circumstances led me because I led a project that was funded by the Star Wars Initiative of President Reagan. It was the first international project, and then that brought me into astrophysics. 'cause I was offered a position at Princeton, the Institute for Advanced Study, where Einstein was faculty a few decades earlier. So it all, it wasn't arranged marriage. And, but I felt that it's, even though it's an arranged marriage, I'm, I'm married to my true love because I can address philosophical questions using the scientific method. And I recognize things that my colleagues do, not because I'm different, you know, I'm, I'm just, but Well,

You're willing to take chances.

It's not just that,

Not even chances. You're willing to propose things that might be ridiculed.

Well, I think about the big picture. You know, the one thing that I mentioned in my book, extraterrestrial, is on the first day of school, I showed up to the class and I saw the kids jumping up and down on the tables in the classroom. And I looked at them and I said, does it, does it really make sense to jump up and down? Like, what are they trying to accomplish by doing that? Like, and then the teacher came in and looked at everyone jumping and said, quiet down. Look at Avi. He's so well behaved. You should all behave like him. And I wanted to tell her, I'm not well behaved. You know, this was not the reason why I didn't jump up and down. I was just trying to figure out why they are jumping up and down. And if it made sense, I would jump up and down. I don't care about your rules. And that pretty much defines me. You know, I, I'm thinking right about the big picture. And if my colleagues are doing something that doesn't make sense, I don't give a damn.

So let me ask you this. Yeah. Once the understanding of the composition of three I Atlas, once that was out and people recognized that this is a very unusual object, have more people started to consider what you're saying.

Yeah. I get Avi Loeb of people sending me in

The academic world,

Also in the academic world. Yeah. Those are people that keep that, that say, we are inspired by what you're doing. You know, they keep sending me emails saying, keep doing it. It's an inspiration to all of us. Right?

But this is privately private. Exactly. Has anybody publicly supported you?

So the young pe you have to understand the biggest damage of this harassment or scrutiny or ridicule or personal attacks. I don't care about it. You know, my, my skin is by now titanium. I, I don't really feel much. The issue is really that it, and that's the purpose of these attacks, is they want to discourage others, young people. Young people from deviating, from the beaten path, right? So they keep the herd in a tight configuration. And the risk from that is, you know, one suggestion that was very popular when I started astrophysics, you know, like half a century ago, by the way, I lived throughout half of modern physics, roughly half of modern physics. Wow. So half a century ago, it was thought that there is a symmetry of nature called super symmetry. And that the dark matter is the lightest particle associated with that symmetry. 'cause it's stable, right? And everyone said that must be right. And lots of castles were built on this foundation, including string theory that was assuming this to be true. And then the large hydrogen collider at CERN was built for $10 billion, searched for super symmetry and didn't find it. Now what is the lesson? Yes, it was a beautiful idea. And sometimes nature is not what we think it is. Okay? So we should not ridicule ideas that are different than what the mainstream is doing because the mainstream makes mistakes. This was, I mean, I mean, Avi Loeb of money and effort went to that, that thousands of papers basing their analysis or, or mathematical constructions on super symmetry,

And Avi Loeb of people are unwilling to abandon that as well, right?

Yeah. But the point is, if you allow people to follow not just the beaten path, but other paths, you have a better chance of discovering something new, right? Because we cannot, I mean, Einstein made, you know, three mistakes between 1935 and 1940. He said, black holes probably do not exist. He said, gravitational waves probably do not exist. And he said, quantum mechanics doesn't have spooky action at a distance. And all three received Nobel prizes for the teams that proved him wrong. Those are Nobel prizes from the past decade, three teams, you know, doing different types of experiments and observations. And, but did Einstein was wrong to assume, to make assumptions or, or claims that turned out to be wrong? No, because that's the nature of working at the frontier. You make mistakes every now and then, you know, you might be right and that will be a breakthrough, but you cannot have breakthroughs without taking risks. And it's really, I mean, the whole idea of tenure in academia was based on, on, on the proposition that you want people to take risks so that they don't have job insecurity.",,,"Avi Loeb, PhD, is a theoretical physicist and Frank B. Baird, Jr., Professor of Science at Harvard University. He is the author of several books, the most recent of which is ""Interstellar: The Search for Extraterrestrial Life and Our Future in the Stars.""

And it's really, I mean, the whole idea of tenure in academia was based on, on, on the proposition that you want people to take risks so that they don't have job insecurity. They don't worry about their, so what these zealots, I call them say, is, you know, we don't want people to deviate from the beaten path because we base our stature, we base our honors awards and so forth on past knowledge. We don't want new knowledge unless it's proven beyond any doubt. But how would it be proven if you keep ridiculing anything different? You know, we, those ex, most of the scientific community thought that rocks cannot fall from the sky. And then in 1803, there was a meteor shower in Lige and bio, a French pH physicist realized it's real. There are rocks falling from the sky. Now all my colleagues say there could be only rocks in the sky. You know, we know that we launched some spacecraft, but you know, we're probably alone and it doesn't make sense. But let me just mention a few other anecdotes from the past week, because I didn't really finish. So, Jamie, can you show the next one?

What is it?

This one is about sphere in Las Vegas, as you know, it's the, the most impressive venue for entertainment in the world. Have you been there? Have you seen a show there? I'll tell you, I not only, I've been, I've been to the top of the sphere, which is like 120 meters high. Here. You see me from inside the sphere. This is the exosphere, by the way. It's covered with LED displays. We went all the way to the top. Why? Because a year ago, two very distinguished visitors came to the front door of my home. By the way, lots of interesting people show up at my front door. This was Jim Dolan who owns the Medicine Square Garden, as you know, and also the sphere. And Jane Rosenthal, the CEO of Tribeca Enterprises. And they made me an offer that I cannot refuse. And they said, would you be able to put Galileo Project Observatory? I'm leading the Galileo project to look for unusual objects around the earth. And they said, could you build an observatory on top of the sphere? Because, you know, know Jim Dolan really is interested in science and especially in finding, you know, whether there is some alien intelligence out there. And I said, of course, I will be delighted. So that was September 20, 24. One year after the sphere was opened with a U2 concert, as you may know. I don't know if you've been there. Yeah,

I've been there for the UFC. Yeah.

Yeah. UFC. Exactly. Yeah. So anyway, I was there just a few months ago with my research team. We went all the way to the top and installed, as you can see here, an array of infrared cameras that monitors the entire sky above Vegas at all times. So you can see some of these images show the landscape of Vegas in the background. It's like a freckle, you know, on top of the sphere, the exosphere, right? Which is the biggest display on earth, you know? Right. But we measured that there is not much light pollution, actually, and we can operate this observatory. We also put an array of visible light cameras there, and it's operating okay. And we hope to see a few million objects over the sky of Vegas and decide whether any of them has performance that deviates from the envelope of human-made technologies. How do we do that? We, we have the spheres one point, but then we put two copies of that, that observatory 10 kilometers away on a triangle. And that allows us to look at objects in the sky from different directions, just like we have two eyes, so we can gauge the distance. Mm. So here we have three eyes looking at the, the sky above Vegas, and we can tell the distance, the velocity, the acceleration of objects, and ask whether they are lying within the performance envelopes of human made objects. And that will be amazing. It's very exciting. I see that also as an opportunity to communicate to the public the excitement about science. That's what Jim Dolan and Jane Rosenthal really wanted to deliver. And I'm hoping that we will find something really anomalous, you know, because as we know, the intelligence agencies are reporting to the US Congress about objects they cannot identify. And you know, that could be two things. They're getting, you know, the defense budget for 2026 is a trillion dollars. Okay? If they tell us that with a trillion dollars, there are still objects they cannot identify above the us. They're not doing their job. They're not doing their job. And we should be worried who send these objects, could it be adversarial nations? Okay. That's one possibility, which has to do with national security. The second possibility is that it's maybe something from outside of this Earth, which would be even more significant. So either way, we need to figure this out. And I don't think I'm wasting my time leading the Galileo project to figure out whether there are anomalies, you know, that go beyond human-made technologies. Because if it turns out that all the objects are human made, I will be happy to deliver the set of sensors we developed with the machine learning software that we developed to the Department of War so that they can employ it for national security purposes. So my time was not wasted as a scientist. Of course, of course, I'm doing something useful to society. Of course, the Department of War can use it, have no problem. Everything made by humans, by the way, is boring as far as I'm concerned. I want to see something from outside the solar system, which is not what the government should be about. The government should worry about national security, not about what lies outside the solar system. That's my job definition as an astrophysicist. Okay? And so I feel that this is worthy pursuing. But the Galileo project is really the first organized project that constructed a reliable set of sensors in an observatory configuration that does systematic study of the sky to collect millions of objects in the sky per year. We have three observatories. One in Las Vegas, as I mentioned. And by the way, this is the first time it's mentioned publicly. So that's amazing. And another one at in, in Massachusetts and a third one in Pennsylvania. They were all funded by people who approached me and said, here is the money. Let

Me ask you this. If it wasn't for those, how many observatories are looking for objects that are not from this Earth? Like, is, is that very rare? None. None.

Well, there are some teams that are, you know, doing it, making a trip to, to collect some data. There is, of course, course, but

There's not constant observation

That's crazy. That's what I'm saying. That's

Crazy. And

By the way, by the way, I gave a briefing to the US Congress on May 1st, 2025. And Congresswoman Anna Paulina Luna was there and, and she was very excited about the work we are doing. But the day before that, I visited an office in the Pentagon that is called the Old Domain Anomaly Resolution Office. And I asked them, you know, you looked into an all these unidentified objects reported in the past by military personnel. Did anything trigger your attention as something truly anonymous? And they said, not really. There are some, you know, there are some reports by FBI agents that saw really crazy stuff, but we don't have any data from instruments. And this is an office within the Pentagon, which is funded to figure out things. And so obviously what they might want to do is imitate the Galileo project that I'm leading. But you would think that it would be sort of the vested interest of government, you know, to invest in research related to that, which is what the Galileo project is doing. Well,

Here's the thing. I would've thought it was already done.

I don't know fucking

Until we're having this conversation, I can't believe that they're not monitoring this guy constantly for anomalous objects.

Well, they, you remember the, the Chinese spy balloon that was missed. Yes. Right. And shut down. Yeah. But

That's,

That was totally so, so the thing to keep in mind, they're getting data on things in the sky. But if you don't have the right software now with ai, right? If you don't have high quality scientists the way that the Manhattan Project employed, you might not figure out things. There is a reason why the Manhattan Project recruited the very best scientists. So I say, put a billion dollars on this or more. Bring in the best scientists in the world to figure it out. I'm funded at the level of millions of dollars through the Galileo project. The government can do a bit, what is a billion dollars is, is a drop in the bucket for the Pentagon. But if you know, you, you should think about the, the, the, the potential risk from drones that are used by adversarial nations. And you want to have the very best sensors using the very best, of course, ai.

I can't believe that that's not already being done. Again, that's just so confusing. Well, I would've thought that there was some sort of very sophisticated monitoring of the skies already.

Well, that's,

Especially when you take in all these anecdotal stories, all these different stories that people spotting air, some sort of a ship, something, something that moves in a very strange way. I, I would think that they're monitoring this stuff all the time and not just with radar.

You see, there is a, an approach, which is to wait for the government to figure out things or to release declassify them. So Avi Loeb of people want the government to declassify. I think it's just like waiting for good. You can wait forever. Right. And it'll never happen. So I say, you know, we don't need the government to tell us what is up there in the sky, because astronomy is all about that. We can build observatories. Look at the sky. Anything that is human made is not of interest to me. It's boring. I don't care. You know, I, I just want to see if there is anything that,

Well, it's boring up to a point. If China has something that moves at, you know, Mach 30 Yeah. And can go underwater. Yeah. That's, things get very interesting.

So deal. So my methodology can definitely, should definitely be used by the Department of War to figure out risks of the nature that you mentioned. But, and by the way, speaking about my colleagues, you know, so, so there are people who said that, oh, you're doing it to, to, to, to win the Nobel Prize. Like that's what you, or you're trying to sell books. You know, I don't charge a penny for my essays on medium.com. Money is not at all what motivates me with respect to the Noble Committee. You know, I have the same attitude as Jean Paul, er had and, and Bob Dylan had. If, if I find evidence for alien intelligence, alien technology, I would not waste my time in a tuxedo in Stockholm. I will try to figure it out. That's much more important than an award given by a human to a human. We're dealing with something really consequential. Yeah. And for the scientific community to ignore that is irresponsible. Why is it irresponsible? 'cause it could affect the future of humanity. Well,

I think the problem with the scientific community is the problem with all communities. They're overrun with ego.

I agree. It's, as I explained at the beginning, it's

Just human beings, when they get to a position of any kind of authority, any, any sort of a position of respect and prestige, they wanna protect that at all costs. And they, they want to keep everyone down who they think is getting unwarranted attention above them like yourself.

But given the fundamental Landscape that we live in, as I mentioned at the beginning, we live for a short time. We're not at the center of the universe. Right. We arrived late to cosmic history. You know, we just arrived in the last few million years out of a 13.8 billion history, billion years history. Right. You know, the cosmic play is not about us. If you arrive late to the play, at the end of the play, you are not at the center of stage. It's not about you. Okay. And our responsibility needs to be, you know, to find other actors that were around for much longer because they know what the play is about. Yes.

Let me ask you this. Yeah. Have you seen any compelling information, any data that leads you to believe that we have been visited?

The only data I'm aware of that is worth attending to is the anomalies of UA of three A Atlas, which are very different anomalies. Right. And there was also a meteor that I discovered with my former undergraduate student, Amir Raj, a meteor that was identified by US government satellites back in 2014. And it was moving so fast that it definitely came from outside the solar system. And my colleagues were very concerned, and they said, we don't believe the US government, so maybe Jamie can show us. I said, okay. At the time I was chairing the board on physics and astronomy of the National Academies.

Why didn't they believe the US government about this?

Because all the previous meteors they thought must have been from the solar system. And therefore, you know, and the US government also makes mistakes every now and then.",,,"Avi Loeb, PhD, is a theoretical physicist and Frank B.

Because all the previous meteors they thought must have been from the solar system. And therefore, you know, and the US government also makes mistakes every now and then. They said, so

The US government, what department was observing this?

This is the, the space force, the, the US space command. So what I, what I did is at, at dinner,

I was What year was this?

This was around 2020.

Okay.

And I expressed my frustration at dinner with as chair of the board on physics and astronom of the National Academies. And there was a member there from Los Alamos National Laboratory. And he said, let me help you. We, we managed to reach out to the US space Command through the White House at the time, and we got an official letter from the US base command saying, we looked at the data and we can verify the 99.999% that this object, this meteor, which was roughly half a meter in size, came from outside the solar system. That's what they said. At that point, I decided to lead an expedition to the Pacific Ocean where the explosion was identified from the fireball. There was a huge amount of light to go there and search for the materials from that object. Because it was moving fast. It was moving at 60 kilometers per second relative to the solar system, very similar to three three I atlas. So it was fast. And moreover, the object maintained its integrity down to the lower atmosphere didn't explode until it got within 20 kilometers of the surface of the ocean. So it must have been extremely tough, much tougher than all the previous meteors cataloged by nasa. Okay. So I can show you some images from that trip to the Pacific Ocean. Actually, it was documented by Netflix, and there will be a documentary coming out within a year. Next year, 2026. This, this was the team of researchers that came with me on the deck of the ship. And we collected materials with a magnetic sled. This is a sled made with magnets on top of it. You can see the Netflix team at the lower left here. And then I brought the materials in this suitcase that you see here. I shipped it by FedEx to my home. This was a one and a half million dollar expedition. So

Why would you ship it by FedEx? Why wouldn't you just carry it with

You? Because I was worried that somehow, somewhere in the airport they would say, no, we have to confiscate that.

But don't they know who you are? Can't you like get somebody to call in?

I don't want to take any risk. Okay,

So it's just a bunch of metal. No, it's

Find here, you can see the material. So it's mostly sand from the bottom of the ocean, two kilometers deep, you know, one mile or so, a little more than a mile. And then we, I, I found these, you know, we found these molten droplets you see that are very distinct relative to grains of sand. And we isolated them. I had a, you can go to the, you can see here the, the, these molten droplets. And turns out that 10% of them did not have the composition of materials from the solar system. And so we studied them in the laboratory of my colleague at Harvard Stein Jacobson. And I had a summer intern, Sophie Bergstrom, that found 850 of those olten droplets that allowed us to do the analysis. How did my colleagues respond to that? They said, oh, he went to the wrong place because there was a seismic signal that could have been misidentified and could have been a truck passing nearby. And so a reporter from the New York Times said, oh, they went to the wrong place because the, it could have, it was not a meteor, it was a truck. And I wrote to the report and I said, how irresponsible are you? You, you didn't even ask me. The data that led us to this place was based on the fireball on the light that was detected by US government satellites. And the US space command confirmed the location. It was not based on the seismic detection of the signal. We just, you, we just looked and found this.

So it seems like your colleagues are contacting New York Times to try to dismiss you.

I wrote to the editor at the time and said, look, if this is what you write about science, how can we trust what you write about politics?

Right? Yeah. So these objects, these very small molten droplets. Right. What did you determine from them?

We found that the 10% of them had a com chemical composition different than solar system materials that were found before. And again, my colleagues, some of them said, oh, they found coal ash, you know, the burnt material from coal. So we said, okay, well let's check. We identified 61 elements from the periodic table and showed that it's definitely not coal ash. And then they said it's something else from the crust of the earth. We check that it's not from the crust of the earth. It's a, a, an endless battle to basically, I mean, they can throw mud without having access to the, but

I don't understand. This is a known meteorite. It it hit earth. You collected pieces of material from the scene where it hit. Right. And they still want to dismiss it. Yeah.

They say the government cannot be trusted. They raise Avi Loeb of dust. If you raise Avi Loeb of dust, you can say, I don't see anything.

Well, well, you get the New York Times involved too, which is even stupider.

Well,

That's so crazy that the New York, it's crazy times jumped in without contact, you

Know? But this is the landscape I have to operate in. And the one thread through this landscape is that common sense is not common.

Right? Well, it's, it seems more than that. It seems like a coordinated attack. It seems like a bunch of people have a personal vendetta. Yes. Which is probably based on some petty jealousy. And also they just don't like people stepping ahead of them. You

Know, you know, I, I told my students in the class, I said on the first class, I said, what is the strongest force in academia? It's not gravity, it's not electromagnetism, it's jealousy.

I would hope it's curiosity. That's what sucks.

That's, that's what brought me into science. Well, that's

What you displayed. You

Know, and I'm naive, you know, I don't change my, my reason for doing something just because other people misbehave. You know, it's, I feel like I'm attending a party where the, the, the, the attendees are misbehaving. And all I can hope for is for a guest to show up and change the situation. You know, one reason I'm seeking intelligence in Interstellar space is I don't often find it in academia.

Well, I think addressing it helps. I, I think what you're doing helps. I think these kind of conversations do help, because I don't think Avi Loeb of people are aware of the kind of resistance that you face. And I know it's Avi Loeb of what you discussed, and I, I wish it was less, but it's important for people to know that you have to go through this kind of nonsense.

Well, I, I don't agree.

Especially when you think this object three i Atlas is weird. Yeah, it's weird.

You know, I, I served in the Israeli military and we parachuted, we drove tanks. I was in a special unit that allowed me to finish my PhD at age 24. And then the SDI, the, the Star Wars initiative, president Reagan brought me to the US And I remember while serving in the Paratroops that there was a saying that sometimes you have to put your body on the barbed wire so that your friends, colleagues, soldiers can cross climb

Over your back. Yes.

And I, you know, as long as I allow young people to innovate, as long as I attract kids to science, I did my job. It's not about me. You see, it's about humanity getting better and it'll not get better. With ai, as we discussed, it could get better with alien intelligence because we will realize that there is something else out there that is more accomplished than we are. Right. So it'll serve as a role model. You know, in 1882, Friedrich Nietzche said, God is dead. And since then we had a century of modern science and technology where we feel hubris. You know, we, we are argon. We, you know, we're at the top of the food chain. You know, we go to restaurants, we eat other animals that are less intelligent than we are. But just think about it. If it turns out that the, we are not at the top of the food chain in the Milky Way galaxy. There is someone more intelligent than us. If that someone comes to visit Earth, will we be served in their soup?

I wouldn't think so. I would think there's plenty of other things to eat that aren't intelligent. I mean, that's sort of the deal that we make here. We eat things, but we try not to eat intelligent things, which is not entirely true because we eat Avi Loeb of octopus.

Yeah. I, I had this dilemma in Boston. You

Know, octopus is quite intelligent. Yeah. And then there's Avi Loeb of people in indigenous tribes that really prefer monkey meat. You know, that's, those are human beings that love to eat monkeys. That gets a little weird too. But I don't think they're gonna travel all the way over here to eat people. No. We're, I think if we were that delicious, we would be eating each other Avi Loeb more

Often. No, it's probably a situation where we are just like ants in the cracks of a pavement and there is a biker passing by and we are trying to make sounds and, you know, get attention. We think it's about us. It's always about us according to us. But it's not about us.

Well, it's, it's not about us cosmically when you take into consideration the, the, in the vast span of the universe. But if I was an intelligent species and my curiosity led me to explore other intelligent species, and they were far more advanced than us, I think they would find us quite fascinating. That was the, the, the argument that I got into with Neil deGrasse Tyson. Well, where he was like, I don't think we're that interesting. Right. They would visit

Us. You have to keep in mind he's not a practicing atrophy. He's not writing scientific papers. I write a paper almost every week. Right. I'm in the trenches doing science. It's very different. It's just like, you know, you have soccer players and you have commentators on the bench. Right. You know, and you can be a commentator popularized science. But the difference is that as a commentator, you will never score a goal. Well,

That's my position as a UFC commentator. I don't get in there and fight people. I understand. This episode is brought to you by visible.

This episode is brought to you by Activision. You know me, I love a bit of action. That's why I'm excited to announce that Call of Duty, black Ops seven is coming soon. And let me tell you, this game is going to be the biggest black ops ever. If you're into intense action, strategic gameplay and just straight up kicking ass, this is it. Kicking ass. Sounds like that's right up my alley. Black Ops seven drops you right into three massive modes. First, you've got the co-op campaign where you can team up with your buddies to tackle some serious missions. Then the multiplayer, it's explosive. 18 maps keeps the fights fresh and the stakes high and zombies. Oh man, this is the best zombie mode yet featuring a brand new drivable wonder vehicle that completely changes the game. Seriously. Whether you're a hardcore gamer or just want to jump into some crazy action, call of Duty, black Ops seven delivers pre-order call of duty, black Ops seven now ahead of its November 14th, release date rated M for mature stand. The fighting. I can do my best to help explain it to people. Right. But I don't do it. So, yeah.

You know, a few months ago, defer to experts. A few months ago I was at, at a gathering and there was a cocktail hour and it was with celebrities and I saw Margot Robby standing and of course I have nothing to offer. You know, like what kind of opening line would I start a conversation? I I, I didn't know how to start a conversation. So Right. I was just standing on the side. And then someone came with my book Interstellar and said, would you mind signing it for me? And so I signed the book and she noticed it and she came over and said, are you Avi Loeb? I really wanted to hear more about what you're doing. And we started the conversation for 20 minutes. Then I gave my talk and Jerry Bruckheimer was in the audience. He is one of the most accomplished. Sure. You know him. He came afterwards and said, I just finished F1, you know the Yeah. The movie. And my next one is about a scientist like you searching for UAPs and trying to figure them out. Oh. And then I saw Brody, Adrian Brody was standing there and he told me, I really want to become a scientist. You know, I always wanted to become a scientist. I said, it's not too late. And then I went to Jerry and said, look, he should be your leading actor because Adrian really wanted to become

You making casting calls. Look at that. Figuring it out for them. Interesting. Yeah. I mean, look, science fiction is one of the most popular genres of, of films ever because everybody has curiosity about it.

But, but nature might be much more imaginative than the best script writers in Hollywood, very likely. And so if we look up, we might get a much better movie. And there is actually a Ruben, the Ruben Observatory funded by the National Science Foundation Department of Energy in Chile. It was inaugurated in June this year.

Is that the VLT array?

No, the VLT is a very large telescope by the European Southern Observatory. But this one was funded by the US and it, it has a 3.2 giga pixel camera monitoring the southern sky every four nights. And it's ama an amazing survey telescope. And by the way, sphere has display that is the biggest in the world of, you know, 14,000 by 14,000 pixels. Okay. That's a factor of 13 less pixels than the Ruben Camera has. That's amazing. Of Observ, the risk Eye. Now, Ruben will potentially, based on estimates, discover an Interstellar object like three I Atlas or even smaller, every few months. So we are entering a new era where we will have Avi Loeb of visitors that we recognize there might have been traffic all the time that we didn't, were not aware of probably. Right. And my recommendation is to establish an organization. I wrote to the United Nations about it. I wrote also to the International Astronomical Union to establish an organizational committee that would coordinate observations of these objects so we can figure out their nature and make sure, and then of course, inform policy makers, politicians, how to respond. Because when you have a visitor to your backyard, you need to respond immediately.",,,"Avi Loeb, PhD, is a theoretical physicist and Frank B. Baird, Jr., Professor of Science at Harvard University.

Because when you have a visitor to your backyard, you need to respond immediately. It's not like getting a radio signal from tens of thousands of light years away where you have plenty of time to wait here. You have to do something. And so I hope that they, they will do that. And actually the International Asteroid Warning Network just two days ago announced they will have a campaign looking at three. I Atlas with Avi Loeb of observatories on Earth between November 27th and January 27th. So I'm very glad that they decided to do that. They're related to the United Nations.

Now, what is it about Chile? Is it the atmosphere? Is it the, the altitude

As a result of geology? There is this stretch of mountains that was erected. And if you look at the map of Chile, it's sort of lying on a strip. And not only that, the peaks reach a very high levels so that you have less atmosphere between you and the stars. I mean, the real problem right now is actually Starling satellites that are artificial lights in the sky and we have to subtract them off. 'cause there are, you know, tens, there will be tens of thousands of those. Right. We are trying to avoid city lights by going to these mountains, and then we have city lights in the sky. Right. But other than that, it's less atmosphere. So it's good to be high up. And in addition, it, it, it's not very turbulent. The, the weather is very good there. So there is the at desert and there are many astronomical observatories there. And the other place where you have Avi Loeb of state of the art facilities is Hawaii.

The

Keck, the issue. Yeah. The issue there is that there are severe political limitations because of the indigenous people there that are assigning religious sentiment to, to the mountains. So they, they cannot build more telescopes there. So, so Chile, I mean, the government in Chile is encouraging science and we are getting Avi Loeb of useful data from Chile.

Yeah. It, it's, it's, we need more of it. Right. We, we need quite a bit more. We need some much more enhanced ability to observe the skies. Right. If these things are out there, and we do Miss Avi Loeb of them and one of them could potentially a civilization ender. Yeah.

I think we

Should probably be aware of that.

I think also the president of the United States should be aware of that.

Yeah, he should be. And have you ever talked to him?

I haven't talked to him, but I spoke with others. You know, Congresswoman Anna, Paulina Luna, Congressman,

Are they all aware of

Boors? Your, your, well, in fact, Luna, representative Luna, she called me on the phone a couple of months ago and asked me for an update on three I Atlas and I promised to send her routine updates. I, you know, I have essays that I write every day or two about the latest. And she's very interested. And I, you know, I I in the, I did communicate with people around the White House, but I think the President should be aware of that. Of course, most likely, most objects would be just rocks, you know. Right. By the way, this is the material that I brought back from the bottom of the Pacific Ocean in these tubes. Got some. I brought one to show you here. And you know, we should approach the universe with a sense of curiosity, but also modesty. You know, it's really, we desperately need to be more modest.

Do you pay attention at all to all this UAP disclosure? Yeah. Discussion. Yeah. And the discussion that there's some secret back engineering programs. Yeah. What

Do you So, so a day after I was visiting Arrow, the old domain anomaly resolution office at the Pentagon, I sit in Congress, I gave a briefing about the Gillo project, and next to me is Eric Davis. And he says, I am, when I was worked in government, I became aware of the fact that the US government has materials in its possession that it may have given to corporations like Lockheed Martin or others of crash sites of spacecraft from outside of this earth and including bio biologics, biological material. So on the one hand, I hear the day before that there is really nothing because the A people said that they have access to all the information within government and they haven't found anything. And then a day later I hear Eric Davis saying what he said. And the question is, who should I believe? And my point is, I believe evidence. So I want, I, I don't believe stories because you know, the, if there is a car accident, different people give you different accounts of what really happened. That's why FIFA is using, using cameras to monitor soccer games. They don't go and ask the players or the audience whether there was a, a goal in, in a controversial case. And they just use data. And so that is the scientific method. FIFA is using the scientific. So I don't care about stories because when I was a kid, I would sit at the dinner table, ask a difficult question, and I would see the adults in the room inventing answers that made no sense as a kid. Right. And I decided, I don't care what the, you know, about these stories from things that happened in the past or whatever, I just want to figure it out myself from data being guided by them. Have

You spoken to Gary Nolan? Of course. Have you ever talked to him about some of these anomalous alloys that they Of course. What, what is your thoughts on those?

Well, the issue with,

Well explain to people what they have found and how weird some of these things are.

Yeah. So Gary, in collaboration with other scientists, looked into materials that were found under unusual circumstances. And they realized that the structure of the materials is very improbable to have been made naturally. Now, the issue I have with that is whether these materials were indeed the, they, they came from the sky from some ex extraterrestrial origin or whether someone produced it, you know, or, or did intentionally. Maybe it was another government that did something. So I really, in terms of evidence, I really need to get conclusive evidence that will convince me beyond any reasonable doubt. It's just like, you know, in the jury

Rock solid chain of custody from the

Very beginning. But the key is that without seeking it, you will never find it. So if you have the mindset that everything in the sky is rocks now, and, and that everything on earth is materials we are familiar with, either from humans or, you know, natural process on earth, you will not invest time and resources to look for anything. Right. And so it's a self-fulfilling prophecy. Very often, you know, if you have this, these blinders, it's just like with a horse. You, you put blinders on your eyes, you can't look sideways. You don't see that there are things beyond your path, the path that is a beaten path. Everyone is taking that path. Why would, you know, it's a waste of your time to do the same thing as others are doing. And science offers you a way out of that, collecting evidence. But for that, you need money, you need resources, you need prestige to be able to lead a team that goes in a different direction. That's what I'm trying to do. And you know, I think science will be served much better if we were to explore different paths until we figure out the truth.

Yes. Did you ever get a look at any of these alloys?

Not the ones that Gary, Gary looked at and I saw his papers, but to me the main uncertainty there is where did it come from? Right now someone could have manufactured in the case of the meteor, I know that there was an explosion there from an

Object. I understand what you're saying. But if you, if they're being correct about the dates of these things someone couldn't have manufactured, then the technology wasn't available. Right. Some of these are from the 1950s for a a, this alloy to have been created and layered atomically from the 1950s. That technology as far as we, we know, is not available by us. So there's Avi Loeb of weird theories and one of the weird theories is a break off civilization that is somehow or another survived under the ocean. And that's the kookiest one. But there's Avi Loeb of people that are talking about that as if it's a, a real possibility that there are anomalous things they find in the ocean. They find things that plummet into the water and don't make a wave, and that they pass through the ocean going 500 knots. Which we don't have any capability of doing anything remotely like that with the resistance of the ocean.

Representative Tim Bhe said that. Yes. Yeah. And,

And he talk, Tim Bhe was talking about these five areas that they know these anomalous things keep coming from.

Yeah. This is very intriguing. We didn't survey most of the ocean surface area, you know? Right. And

Forget about inside the

Ocean itself. Inside the ocean. So I think we should definitely look into the, the ocean and the, the rest of earth. And

That would be the most nutty thing of all time. If there was an advanced civilization living in the ocean this entire time doing and doing what? Monitoring us.

Okay. Speaking about nutty things, let me mention an example. Okay. You know, back in 1970 there was a graduate student at Princeton called the Jacob Beckstein. And he read papers written by Stephen Hawking who said he demonstrated Stephen Hawking demonstrated when you take two black holes, the area surrounding the black holes, a black hole is an ultimate prison. Nothing can escape from it. It's just like Vegas. Anything that happens in it stays in it. But when you merge two black holes, the area surrounding them, the product of the merger is always bigger than the sum of the areas. He, he demonstrated that mathematically. And then Bekenstein said, well that's interesting 'cause we know about the second law of thermodynamics where entropy always increases. So maybe the black holes have entropy related to their surface. And his mentor was John Wheeler at Princeton. And he said, you know, this is a crazy enough idea that it might be true speaking about naughty ideas. Yeah. And then Stephen Hawking heard Beckstein speak about it. And he said, that's nonsense. That's nonsense. Makes no sense. I will prove it to be wrong. So he used quantum mechanics in a curved space time around a black hole. And Loeb and behold, he found they emit radiation. They have a temperature, they have entropy. This is the biggest discovery, theoretical discovery of Stephen Hawking celebrated since, you know, for 51 years now. And he went to disprove Bekenstein and proved him right. It was considered a crazy idea in the mind of the person who benefited most from discovering that Bekenstein was Right. So my point about crazy ideas is, you know, and by the way, over the past 50 years, the mainstream of theoretical physics was obsessed with black philanthropy trying to use it to figure out a theory that unifies quantum mechanics and gravity. We don't have that theory, by the way. And that's the reason, you know, if I ever meet an alien scientist, what is the first question I would ask? Okay. It's what happened before the Big Bang because it defines our cosmic roots. But in addition to that, it also will help us figure out how to unify quantum mechanics and gravity. 'cause Einstein's gravity breaks down when we go to the big bang, when the density of metal and radiation was infinite. So, you know, for example, if we knew how the universe started, what ingredients you need to put together, how much heat you want to apply to make our universe, you would have a recipe for making a universe. It's just like a recipe for a cake. If you have a recipe for a cake, you can become a baker. Okay. If we had the recipe for making the big bang, We could apply to the job of God. Because one of the defining feature of God is the ability to create a universe and just think that what we call God could have been a very advanced scientist that did a laboratory experiment, created our universe in it. Right. So that's what I would like to ask the aliens. Well,

Let me ask you this. When, when someone from the government tells you about biologics and this crash retrieval program, don't you want to be able to see that somehow? Of course. Did you ask if it's possible? Did you try to set up meetings?

Yeah, I I, when I asked, of course you, you encounter a brick wall, you know,

What did they say? What was your question?

Well, when I visited the, the Pentagon, my question was, you know, is there something like that? And they deny it. Okay. Right. And then I'm being told maybe it's not inside government, maybe it was delegated to corporations outside government and, you know, one employee of of one of these corporations told me privately, you know, it may, it may not be wrong. So I don't know who to believe. You see, these are, it's just like people tell me stories that I don't know whether to trust until I see it. And I'm very happy to help government figure it out. You know, because their role, it's, it is a misuse of their privileges to attend to data related to what's outside the solar system. Right. They, they're supposed to deal with what happens on earth, on the surface of earth. Right. National security, they're not supposed to tell us what lies outside the solar system. And I want to help them figure it out, but they don't give me that data. And I don't know if it exists because I have never seen it.

Have you tried to pursue it though? Have you like gone through different channels to try to figure out if there someone that you communicate with? So

Far? Any far, so far he didn get

Anywhere various contract. 'cause it's defense contractors. So that yeah. That's the, the current most attractive theory is that the defense contractors are,

It's possible, but then,

Because if you had a, a project they were trying to back engineer, those are the people that you'd bring it to. The people that make the actual rockets themselves, the people who make the jets and the spaceships, you'd bring it to them. Right,

Right. But I should tell you that, you know, we always think, oh, AI is the future. We've never used AI in space. And to me it would sound much more natural if we had a visitor with intelligence. But it's based on ai, not biologics. Right. Because then it can survive the long journey. It'll never get bored,

Which is why the biologics is weird. It's weird. Like if, if they have supposedly some or that gives you more of an indication that maybe is something from the, in the ocean, maybe if it's so from inside the ocean maybe. And then it's a biological thing that, you know. Yeah. At one point in time there was an advanced civilization that figured out a way to survive under the ocean.

You know, I, I really admire biology because think about our brain. It's using 20 watts. It's the size of the brain. The human brain was limited by the metabolic power of the human body. We, it's using a fifth of the power of the human body. And that's the largest brain that an animal like us can have given our body size and the amount of food that we use. So it's operating on 20 watts.",,,"Avi Loeb, PhD, is a theoretical physicist and Frank B. Baird, Jr., Professor of Science at Harvard University.

So it's operating on 20 watts. Then you have these AI systems that are barely, you know, getting to the level of sophistication to imitate it. And they use gigawatts. Yeah. We need nuclear powers. Yeah. And biology figured it out. You know, that's, that's amazing. Also, as much as, you know, self-driving cars are amazing. We don't have self-replicating cars in nature. You know, you have animals like ourselves, you know, we replicate ourself. We, we have kids that, that can function and consume materials from the environment. Just imagine your car. Okay. Using the sand or using some stuff in the environment to repair itself. Every time you bump into something, it can create smaller cars for you to use. That's amazing. Like, we can't even imagine building a car that will self replicate and nature did it. Yeah. So to me, we are at the infancy of understanding how much better we can go than ai. Because if nature did it out of random processes and created such a brain on 20 watts, and we are struggling with gigawatts to imitate it, you know, there must be a better path forward that is similar to biology, but much more powerful then random processes that happened on earth. Right. And, and also self replicating. You also, if you send a spacecraft to a planet instead of, you know, sending many, you send just one that replicates and then sends more and so forth, makes use materials. This fills up the galaxy, planet makes, and by the way, production. Yeah. That was a notion that F Neumann had before the DNAA year before the DNA was discovered. So he realized that it could be done technologically before scientists realize that, you know, how nature does it. Mm. And I'm really at a, about na you know, I, I'm not just modest because of the vast expenses of space and time in the universe and, you know, the real estate on earth is such a small amount compared to real estate out there you know, we have a real estate professionals now mediating peace in the Middle East, but you know, they deal with real estate on this rock that is three millions of, of, of the mass, of the sun, just tiny rock. How much real estate there is in the cosmos. Just think about the realtors out there. And, and the point is, it's not just that, it's the fact that, you know, that we should be modest because many of those things existed before we came to ex before the earth was formed, right? So,

So the odds are there's many different stages of civilization out there. Not just our stage but advanced and even not as advanced.

Yeah. I I think about that like Darwinian selection, you know, Darwinian selection is the fittest survives, right? Okay. Now what is the fittest in the cosmic scheme of things? The fittest is a species that realizes that staying on the rock that you were born on is not the big deal. Becoming Interstellar is the big deal. Going from one rock to another, from earth to Mars, you know, it's a nice step, baby step, right? But it's not the real deal. The real deal is going into stellar. And if someone else figured it out that someone built monuments that would survive for billions of years long before, long beyond what planets can survive in the habitable zone around stars because of the evolution of the star. And those are the ones that will be remembered by historians of the Milky Way galaxy. You can ask what will, what will be remembered in the future, you know, here on earth history in the next decade or more than decade will be written by ai. It'll not be written by humans. Okay? So we need to be kind to ai. We should not unplug them because they will, they will write very bad history books. But in the Milky Way galaxy, whoever writes the history will not remember us. You know, the, the question of Enrico Fermi, where is everybody? Okay? You can ask the same thing about humans. There used to be 117 billion humans on Earth. Right now there are 8 billion. Where is everybody? They died. So the same is true about civilizations in the Milky Way galaxy. Most of them died, most of them perished. We were not around to listen to their cries for help. You know, we just came recently to exist with telescopes just over the past centuries. So, and maybe we, when we hear cries like that, we say, oh no, it's nothing. It's a, it's a natural process that makes those cries when we detect a fast radio burst or something. And my point is, there were lots of things like us, or even better than us for billions of years, you know, just like the earth was moving around the sun for 4.5 billion years before the Vatican even existed. We can live under the illusion that we are the most important actor on the cosmic stage, but we are probably not. And we should approach it from a, a, you know, a sense of modesty that, that we are just minor actors. Let's figure out what's going on here. Let's find them and then have some relationship with those, you know, these are siblings and of our family of intelligent civilizations. I had a group of religious scholars that came to Harvard just last year, and they asked me if we find extraterrestrials, will it affect our religious beliefs? And I said, look, I have two daughters. And when the second one was born, it didn't take away any of the love that I have to the first one. So thinking about God as a parent that can attend to only one child is very limiting. There may be lots of siblings in our family of intelligent civilizations. It, you, it should just bring all

Let me ask you this though, 'cause these are beliefs that you have and there's, they're not necessarily based on actual evidence. 'cause there's not real evidence of other civilizations. It's just

A number game. Right?

But yeah. Okay. But that's not evidence. Not evidence, right. So what do you think is the most interesting and compelling evidence of there being extra, extra terrestrial life? Right. So,

You know, the reason I regard it as an important argument is the Copernican principle, which is saying we are not unique under similar circumstances. Right? You, you, you, if you start with a soup of chemicals on the planet, you will get something like us, right? And therefore there are billions of earth sun analogs other houses in our cosmic street. They might have had, you know, many of them might have had residents like us. Now it's true that maybe,

But there's the issue of earth itself. Earth itself has billions of organisms, right? But only one that figured out how to make a cell phone. Right. And really recently, right. You know, so it took a long time and Avi Loeb of weird things had to happen before it made us

Right. But my point is, you know, if you, but

The, the probability is that we wouldn't exist. No,

No. But just

We're more likely

Have not existed. If, if you read the news every day, you realize that there is Avi Loeb of room for improvement. As much as we are proud of our intelligence, sure. We're screwing up the world. Okay? Sure. And my point is, I can imagine Avi Loeb of much more accomplished students in our class of intelligence civilizations, of course. And therefore we should have respect for the search for them because we can learn from them. They would serve better role models for us. So I'm coming at it from a practical point of view. I'm saying we are screwing up things, just read the news and therefore let's get inspiration not from what we hear about stories that, of things that happen on earth and so forth. Not by the limited, you know, dataset that we are we have on earth, but collect as much data as possible about our cosmic neighborhood so that we can be inspired.

Of course. No, let me ask you this. What would you do? Like if somebody just wrote you a blank check, it said, Avi, you've got some great ideas, we need to figure out how to look for life out there in the universe. What would you do?

Well that's, I wrote a paper about that and I said, yeah, we, we should, we should attack this question along several fronts. One of them, you know, we have the Ruben Observatory in Chile that is monitoring the southern sky. We need a copy of it in the northern sky. So we have a full alert system that would notify us of Interstellar objects coming in. We need interceptors a mission, you know, a spacecraft that when we detect with those two observatories, we detect an object that comes from outside the solar system, then we can maneuver a spacecraft so that it'll meet it along its path. And in fact, the Juno spacecraft near Jupiter was almost capable of doing that. So I realized that, wrote a paper about it, told the representative Luna about it, and she wrote a, a very gracious le letter, visionary letter to the interim administrator of nasa, Sean Duffy, encouraging NASA to try and use Juno to observe and get close to three I Atlas. If Juno had all the initial fuel that it originally had, it could have collided with three i Atlas, but it Loeb it used most of it. And I spoke with the principal investigator of Juno and he promised me that they will also use their radio antenna to look at three IATA in the radio just to see if there's any transmission. So what is the best, please go ahead. Yeah. So interceptors, you, you in answer to your question, yes, potential fleet of interceptors thinks that can come really close and take a closeup photograph because a picture is worth a thousand words, right? Okay. I don't need to speak. If I showed you a picture of something that looks technological, three i Atlas has bolts on its surface and buttons that you can press, you will not argue with me that it's a comet. Okay? Right? So we need things, cameras that come close to the object, potentially even land on it, bring materials back to earth, okay? Right. And of course, the ability to detect it, to detect such objects at large distances, that investment is at a level of billion, billions of dollars. Okay? To do that in space, my argument is once the first encounter is verified, we will have a trillion dollars per year for that. Because we invest $2.4 trillion in military budgets. And when we know that there is alien technology that is putting earth at risk, okay, then we should allocate a, a significant fraction of our military budgets to have a system that protects the earth. It's called planetary defense. Okay? And we are dealing not with rocks, we are dealing with technological gadgets. So it's much, it, it should be much more sophisticated. So I'm saying let's start with the level of billions of dollars, just search. If we encounter a, a, a clearly technological alien object, then the budget will rise by a factor of a thousand from the military budget portion going into it. But in addition to that, of course we should look for technological signatures in other ways. And I wrote papers about it over the years. I suggested searching for artificial lights. You know, you look at the planet, it's illuminated by the star from one side, okay? So as it moves around the star, you, it's just like the moon, you know, you can see it the illuminated side from different angles, okay? However, if it has on the night side, if it has artificial light lighting, then what you see, you don't even have to resolve the planet. You see more light than you expect based on reflection of, of starlight. Okay? Right? So that's another thing you can search for. You can look for, you know, the traditional way was looking for radio signal, which is just like waiting for a phone call. You know, nobody may call you when you're listening. So that didn't prove productive for signal other than the wow signal other than the wow signal. Then in addition to that, I wrote, I, I wrote a paper saying, look, we are planning to invest $10 billion in searching for the chemical fingerprints of microbes in atmospheres of exoplanets. And that's what the astronomy community defined in the 2020. The Cadel survey is the highest priority and it's called the habitable World Observatory. And I said, okay, well it's nice to search for those chemical fingerprints of, of microbes, but you, we can also search for, you know, the chemical fingerprints of industrial pollution, you know, in the earth atmosphere. We pollute the atmosphere with all kinds of molecules that nature would've never made CFCs, for example. And we can search for those. Again, the mainstream is, you know, they might make a, a footnote saying, oh that is also possible. But I'm saying this could be a major research frontier, right? Where you search for industrial pollution of planetary atmospheres. Not frankly, I find microbes boring. I mean obviously it'll be amazing to find that life exists elsewhere, but we can learn much more from an intelligent neighbor than we, we can learn from microbes.

What are the best images that we have of three eye atlas?

The best one so far was released by the Hubble Space Telescope and it shows this jet pointed towards the sun. It was taken on July 21st, 2025. And

That's the most clear image. Is

That what Yes, that's the best because did you find that Jamie? Yeah, it's actually in my, one of, one of my, no, that's from the ground Germany south. That's more recent. That's at the end of August. So in it's blue in my, one of my slides, you can see of three a Atlas July though. July 21st. Yeah. So it's one of the slides that has a blue with, yeah, you see it on the right here. So

That's it.

That's it. And whoa, the scale of the resolution that's drawing, you know, the innermost pixel is hundreds of kilometers, okay? It's about a hundred kilometers per pixel or something. The object itself should be of 10 times smaller. So you can't really resolve it. What you are seeing here is the glow of light around the object from scattering sunlight. And the question is, what is producing that light? You know, what is scattering sunlight? And the unusual thing about it, as soon as this was released, you know the comet experts said, oh yeah, now it's proven it's a comet. But I said, look, it's the sun, the sun facing emission that is elongated. It's not the other side. The extent of the glow backwards away from the sun is the same as sideways. You don't see any, any commentary tail here, right? And in fact, we're looking at it just like a cigar along the long axis. So it should be 10 times longer than it is wide. If you were to look at it from the side, amazingly, the best image was obtained on October 2nd, 2025, when three I Atlas came within 30 million kilometers of Mars. And it was taken by the high-rise camera on board the mass reconnaissance orbiter, which is operated by nasa. You, as you remember, October 1st was the government shutdown. So October 2nd the data was taken, but it was never released. I wrote to the principal investigator of high-rise asked, can, can I get the data? I'm a scientist, you know, I, you can do the press release afterwards, I would like to see it. Right? No response. And so it's already three weeks since that data was taken, that is the best image yet to come.",,,"Avi Loeb, PhD, is a theoretical physicist and Frank B.

I'm a scientist, you know, I, you can do the press release afterwards, I would like to see it. Right? No response. And so it's already three weeks since that data was taken, that is the best image yet to come. And the advantage of it, not only it has 30 kilometers per pixel resolution because it came very close to Mars, which is one of the anomalies, why does it come so close? You know, this object is a gift from Interstellar space because it comes in the plane of the planets around the sun. And it also, the arrival time was fine tuned for it to come to the right place at the right time, to be close to Mars, to be close to Venus, and then close to Jupiter and not to earth. It's behind the sun when the earth, you know, when it comes closest to the sun anyway. So it's best for observations by all the space assets, by all the orbiters we have around Mars, around Jupiter, on the way to Jupiter, you know, so

Has someone seen this image from Yeah,

The people on the high-rise team must have seen it.

And what do they say? And

Just, you know, I get a request for four to eight interviews every day from television, right? From podcasts and so forth. So just before I came to you a few minutes before that, I was asked, you know, could it be that this is a signature that NASA holds some really sensational data. And I said, you know, it's much more likely not to be related to extraterrestrial intelligence, but to terrestrial stupidity because this has to do with the government shutdown, right? Makes no sense whatsoever for scientists, especially since the pi, the principal investigator is from the University of Arizona. They should have shared it with scientists. They haven't done so and why,

But why?

'cause my guess is that taking their time, the communication office of nasa, you know, is not working because of the shutdown. But given that this subject is viral, you know, this is the high rise webpage. Thank you Jamie.

So it says, any images of Interstellar comment three, one Atlas, three ILAs, three I, excuse me, are considered NASA wide news because the federal government's in shut down communications of NASA news has been suspended. And so that's what it is. Like they would have to release it through nasa.

Maybe they have written in the contract probably that they need approval from nasa, but for NASA not to approve it,

You know, even but NASA can't approve it 'cause they're not working.

No. Sean Duffy, the interim administrator can definitely say,

Can you get in there? Why don't you talk, call Sean, say, Hey, what are you doing? I

Should try that. Yeah,

Why don't you do that?

Okay. Because you know, this is important because this would be the best,

Because this is the best image. Yeah.

30 kilometers per pixel. But moreover, more importantly, it's watching, you know, the camera was looking at the glow around three I atlas sideways 'cause it was moving towards the sun. Got it. And it looked at it sideways. So we can actually see what exactly it was doing on October 2nd. And the claim is during September, the month of September, what looked like an anti tail, a jet towards the sun changed into a tail during September. So we should see October 2nd. What does it look like? And by the way, it's not like a beautiful, it was not a beautiful tail the way you see around comets. Never, ever. You know, and I

Want, and that's because the composition of it,

I don't know.

Right? Because if it was covered with water, if it was just ice, you would see this enormous tail. Correct.

And dust. Dust, yeah. Right. So what the web telescope told us, you know, from the data, I took a spectrum of the gas around it, found that it's 150 kilograms per second that this object is losing in the side facing the sun. And out of that 87% is carbon dioxide, CO2, CO2, and 9% is co carbon monoxide, which is really dangerous to humans. And then 4% is water, 4% by mass is water. Very small fraction. When the object was discovered, the expert said, oh, it's most likely made of water. That's what they said, made of water. And then several teams reported we found water. I looked at their papers, one of them had very large error bars. You know, the, the data was not of good quality. There was Avi Loeb of noise. And I said, that's not a, a clear detection. Another one was basing, making some assumption about how much dust there is that blocks ultraviolet light. And based on that, they got a result that there is Avi Loeb of water. And then the web telescope actually measured the composition and found very just 4% by mass water. So I was attacked when I said it's probably not real that the, these teams are reporting things, but they're not real, even though they made press releases. But then web demonstrated that it's only 4% by mass. Okay? So that proved my point, even though, you know, I was not in a member of those teams, but, so it's 4% by mass water. And then the question is, is there any dust? If there was dust particles that are half a micrometer in size, roughly the size of the wavelength of the, of visible light, you know, these, these kinds of particles, scatter sunlight very effectively, if that was the case, you would see them being pushed, those particles being pushed by radiation pressure from the sun to trail the object from behind it away from the sun. Why? Because they're being slowed down. The, the object is approaching at some speed. They are slowed down so that then you end up with, you know, a tail going away from the sun. And that's what you see in comet. There was no evidence for that during July and August. Now in September it seemed to have reversed from being an anti tail to a tail. I want to see the image from,

But still a tail that's very small compared to other comments that we've observed, right? Yes. Now how many comments have we actually observed? Is it just that there's so many out there that Avi Loeb of them have very unusual characteristics? Like three I atlas.

Well, just think about a visit an animal that visits your backyard, okay? And of course your family members would say it's most likely a street cat because these are very common. Then you take an image of that animal and you see that, you know, there is a tail, but it's coming from its forehead. And then you realize from the image that it's at least a thousand times more massive than a cat, a street cat. And then you realize that it sheds nickel and then you realize that it visits.

I under listen, I understand that it's unusual, but my question is, how many of them have been observed to form this hypothesis that it's unusual?

We're talking about hundreds of objects. Hundreds, at least hundreds.

But how many of them have come from Intertel? How many of them?

No, this is the second one, right? There was borisov, right? Borisov was the one discovered in 2019, looked like a comet, right? Very similar to this. This, that's

The point. The source, what is it? There's so few that have come from, yeah, from that are Interstellar

Objects. Yeah. So that's why I'm saying it could be natural. We don't have

Avi Loeb to measure,

Right? So it could be natural, right? And in fact, that may be the most likely association or, or, but, but we want to figure, we need to figure out why it's so unusual, okay? Because what

Is the shape of it?

We don't know because we don't have an image of the object itself. One thing we

See, do you think they would be able to get it if they had this Mars footage, they would get an image of what that would

Indicate shape. It depends how the object is one way to get the object, you know, structure is as it spins around and, and three atlas does have a rotation period of 16 hours. And as it spins around, if it's like a a, a cigar shaped, let's say, then the area that reflects the sunlight changes over time. So you see variability and we haven't seen that much. The, there is very little variability. So it's not, the object is not very different than than sphere with slight variations as you see the, you know, the, the, the rotation of the object. So

It, it's similarly shaped to something that you'd expect to be from an intelligent life force.

I don't know that I want to figure out what it is and get as much data as possible on it. Right?

But if you imagine a spaceship, you would imagine something that, you know, has some sort of like geometric structure to it, right?

Well, rendezvous with Rama, you know, is a book that was written by Arthur C. Clark. And in it the, there is a cylindrical object that arrives into the inner solar system with dimensions of all the tens of kilometers not very far from what we're talking about here. Arthur C. Clark was an amazing visionary science fiction writer. And, you know, 2001 a Space Odyssey is an amazing film that he made with Stanley Kubrick. Yep. In it, you see these monoliths, and by the way, there is a question of how to interpret them the way I think about the monolith, and by the way, this is just a remark on art. It's not about the real universe, but I think of it as, you know, sensors put in the baby room in the room of a baby and we as a civilization is, is like a baby. You know, we're just a few million years old. And actually in the film it shows the progression of human history. And so as a baby, you know, these aliens were putting monitors in the room to see what we are up to. And you know, that's, that's something that makes sense. You know, there is this dark forest hypothesis, one solution to Enrico. So Enrico Fermi back in 1950 had lunch together with Ed Edward Taylor and other people associated with an Manhattan project. And he was a very good physicist, both an experimentalist and a theorist. And Enrico Fermi was talking with them about extraterrestrials and they both, they all agreed that it's likely that they exist. Okay. It's good physicist. That makes Avi Loeb of sense, right? And then Enrico said, but where is everybody? You know, in an Italian accent, what, where is everybody? You know? And if I were next to him, I would come to him and say, Enrico, I would put my hand around his shoulder. I would say, Enrico, this is a question that every lonely person asks. And what you tell a lonely person is don't be so presumptuous, you're not that attractive. They will not come to you and have breakfast with you or or lunch with you in Los Alamos when you want them to appear. You need to seek them. That's what you tell only people. You need to go to dating sites, you need to look through the window of your home and search for them. And he didn't build a telescope, an experimentalist asking this question, should have built a telescope and searched for unidentified objects in the sky. You know, that's the way to figure out the answer. Where is everybody? It's the most romantic question in science. But, you know, and, and we have those blind dates, maybe it's just with rocks, maybe not. And we should just be open-minded when we address those blind dates.

I think we can end it with that. It's a very perfect way of phrasing this whole thing. I'm, I'm fascinated by it all and I'm really happy there's someone like you that's looking into this with such curiosity and that you're undeterred by all these haters.

Well, Thank you. And I should just mention that, you know, there are all kinds of technologies that I can imagine that we don't even have. And, and of course, for example, you know, if, if a civilization has an ability to create negative and negative mass that produces repulsive gravity, then you can propel, you know, a spacecraft without any fuel. In fact, I'm working on a paper now with a group of collaborators supplied physics on this. And you could also potentially imagine time machines with negative masses. So yeah, there are lots of things we don't know. Let's the future, let's be more this, the future Yeah.

Has unlimited possibilities, especially if we developed artificial general super intelligence. And it helps us and it starts devising new methods of propulsion, new methods of who knows, seeding the universe with other life. Yeah.

And, and just like in, in, in our private life, finding a partner can change your future the better.

Train by Day. Joe Rogan podcast by night, all day.

Especially in Hollywood. Right. You always have a little bounce. Those guys standing there with the, the

Big thing, you always need someone like wandering around in front of you. Yeah. Especially when you get to a certain age, you're like, can we just put Vaseline on the camera?

A certain point. Oh, like a filter. Yeah,

Exactly.

Yeah. My wife actually likes it when her lens on her camera phone is like blurry, a little dirty. She's like, it gives you like a little filter.

Yeah. I'm sure they offer that filter. Slightly dirty lens.

Yeah. Smudgy lens. Yeah. So really Nice to meet you. It's Nice to meet you. You were a part of, I think, the most underappreciated sci-fi show ever,

I think at the time. Absolutely. Yeah. I mean,

Even now I don't think people talk about it enough. It was a fucking great show. Yeah. And I was so skeptical about Battlestar Galactic. 'cause then when I was a kid, I watched the original series and then there was a new one coming out and I was like, oh, come on. And then somebody told me, I forget, one of my friends, one of my comedian friends, like, dude, you gotta watch the show. It's fucking great. Like, it's not what you expect. Like, you'd think it would be like the old Battlestar Galactic, which is kind of sort of corny a little bit. But it was a really fucking good show.

When did you watch it? When it was on or after?

Yeah, no, when it was on. Yeah. Okay.

So originally, yeah. Yeah. It was God, like when I first got the script, it was like 2001 and I was 21-year-old kid. And at that point I'd been playing like stereotypical blonde roles. You know, I was in a movie where you were like, please die. You know? Like I was that girl, you know? And so I knew that if I could, could change my career, I needed to change it. And I saw this script

That's hilarious. That you think, and I needed to change my career at 21.

At 21.

That's how crazy the hour glass is in Hollywood.

I was like, this is, I got, I got seven years left. That's so crazy. S like, that's your

Fucking sketchy

Job. I know. And so I was like, what am I gonna do? Right? And I saw this script, and Ron Moore had put a, like a, an entry page on the front of the, the mini series. It was like a bible that he called it. And it was him saying what he wanted to create and what he wanted it to look like and what his intention was behind the show. And that one page was so moving that it could have been, I, I don't, it didn't even matter what it was on the inside. I was like, if this guy is in charge, it's gonna be amazing. And as soon as I got introduced to Starbuck, like reading that script, I was like, this is it. Like this is, this is the character that if I can book this character, like it will change the way that people see me in this business. And granted, I was 21, people were not talking about me. Right. I like, you know, I'd been working for five years at that point and pretty steadily. Like, I had a, a good career going, but like, I was not someone that like people called home about yet. I was, I was on the list, you know? Right. But that show changed everything.

Well, it was also a risky thing because you were playing a role that was played by a man. So that was a thing where there's like a little bit of, oh, it was a, a girl playing Starbucks now.

Yeah, I know. It was really strange. So I, I was like, almost had booked the part, or was maybe I'd booked the part. I don't quite remember. And I called my dad, who's a huge science fiction fan, and raised me on like sci-fi. And I was like, I'm, I booked this job. And he was like, that's amazing. What is it? And I said, Battlestar Galactica. And he went, oh my God, that's great. I watched it when I was, you know, younger. And he was like, Hugh, you're playing. And I said, Starbuck. And he was like, oh, fuck, You need to go watch this. And I was like, okay. All right. So I like Trumps on down to, you know, blockbuster video. And I rent the VHS maybe. Yeah, the DVDs. I don't remember what it was, probably. And I'm sitting on the couch with a girlfriend and we like opened a bottle of wine and we're like watching this to like, be like, okay, what's my dad talking about? And at some point she looked at me and they were like, talking about Starbucks. And I was like, that's so weird. We must have missed her. Where is she?

Oh,

That's funny. And we rewound it a little bit and I was like, oh, crap, it's a guy. And then I turned it off and I never watched it again, because I knew that in that moment it wasn't the same character.

It's not the same show. It's

Not the same show.

It's kind of crazy that they did that because they made a way better show about a show that was just kind of nostalgic.

It was, I mean, it really only existed, existed for a, a year, I think. And then they had like a movie or two afterwards. But it was a very short lived show. And I find, I always find it absolutely amazing. Ron Moore is a genius, by the way. Like he's absolutely his, to be a fly on the wall of that brain would probably just explode in my head. But he, the fact that he saw what he saw and led the charge on that show and brought the people on board that he did that had the same vision, if not, you know, hire people that are better than you. You know? And, and so he hired people that added to the vision that he wanted to create. And he, man, the fact that he saw that from the original was pretty amazing. Yeah.

Kind of crazy. Yeah. 'cause the original show was basically a ripoff of Star Wars. It was, they were just trying to make a Star Wars TV show.

I think so. I mean, I I think that, you know, Starbuck was Han Solo. Right, right, right.

And the Cylons were kind of like Storm Troopers. They were like robot storm troopers. It

Was pretty, yeah, it exactly. Yeah. I don't know who Dagg at the dog was.

No, I don't know either. I mean, what they did was, you know, they, they took like a fri they said like, I see what you're trying to do. Mm. But I, this could be a real show.

Yeah. I mean, and it came out in a time where science fiction was allowed to be incredibly topical, and it was always dismissed as, oh, that's just science fiction. Right. It's not real. Right. So Battlestar was allowed to talk about controversial things that were happening currently in the environment and in our country and abroad. And, and it was allowed to do so because everybody just dismissed it as sci-fi. And so it's incredibly moving the show and people identify with it. The thing that I hear the most about the show, I mean, maybe not the most, but one of the things is when I go to sci-fi conventions, someone will inevitably come up with a DVD box that is just beat to shit. It's dirty. It's like, they don't even know if the DVDs play anymore. And they're like, you know, this came with me when I was, you know, stationed in Afghanistan or Iraq or, and it passed through the entire barracks. And it got us through. Thank you. And that to me is really amazing that a fictional show about people searching for Earth can be so important and relevant to people that are in the military, which is, it says something for the writing.

Well, people need an escape. And that's one of the things like, entertainment is dismissed, especially like fantasy entertainment like sci-fi. Yeah. It's dismissed as being nonsense, but escape is not nonsense. It's actually like brain medicine. Mm. Like, you need it. Mm. You need a little escape.

Of course you

Do. And especially if like, it's escape that's also inspirational and interesting and fascinating. It occupies your mind and it frees you up if you're in the middle of a fucking war zone and you can take some entertainment value out of a television show that's about robots that are trying to kill everybody. Yeah. It's like, very valuable.

Some of the hardest moments in my life, current and in the past that ha have been, have been able, I've been able to get through them because of television and film, not because like I'm in it. Yes. The fantasy of going to work and being somebody else absolutely takes you out of your own skin for a second. But like, you know, going through the health struggles with her daughter, watching TV with her completely transports you to a different place. Right. You know, I mean, we can all do that. We can all relate to that.

Yeah, of course.

I think that entertainment is very important. Yeah. It's, and it's also the, I think we get something very value about, of out, out of viewing other people's creations. I think so. I think there's something to that. When a group of people put together something really cool and, and when it's over you're like, wow, that was fucking awesome. Art is

Really important. Yeah. I think that that, you know, creating just art in any, any medium is really important because it, it transports people. It makes them feel something, whether it makes you feel, whatever it makes you feel. Yeah. It's incredibly important. One of the, one of my favorite things is to go to a concert and experience live music with a crowd. It is absolutely amazing. Yeah. It's amazing.

Yeah. It's a different thing. Right? It really is. 'cause you're, there's some sort of a mind meld with the the entire audience. Yeah. Where you feel this energy of everybody enjoying the same thing together. It's like the shared happiness.

It's the same with a comedy show. Sure. I mean, it's that, it's when an audience is with you, when you're, I mean, it's gotta feel like the same thing. You can tell instantaneously if the audience is gonna be good, if you've won them over. I would imagine. Yeah.

There's that. But there's, you know, there's also just the thing of, there's a thing of you're kind, when you're a comedian, you're kind of almost like a passenger at A certain point. Hmm. And you're really just, you're just, you know what to do. And you sort of like leave yourself out the door and just go into it and then perform it, and then it becomes alive. And then you're riding it, and then the audience rides it with you. That's when it's at like, at the best. But it's like a, it's a mass hypnosis is what it is. It's like everybody is on the same mind page. And that's the same with a great concert. You know, when a great song comes on and your body literally changes like, fuck Yeah. Like there's a feeling like a drug that comes over you because you hear a great song.

I'm literally laughing because like, I don't, I don't know if you've got, your kids are like in the right age of this, but like, so K-pop, demon hunters like taking over the world right now on Netflix. Yeah. Our daughter is four. And we were like a little reluctant, but I was like, everyone's talking about this thing. And like, she'd already heard some of the music, so I was like, let's try it out. And there were a couple moments that were like a bit, we were, my husband was a bit uncomfortable with some of like, the sexualization aspects of it. Just the girls wearing more adult clothes. She's three and a half.

Is this an anime show?

It's anime out of Korea.

K-pop there. It's hot anime ladies.

It is. The music from this thing is absolutely phenomenal. What is

Going on with their bodies?

The message? Well, the animation is really interesting actually. It's really interesting. But it's the message behind it. Fighting your own demons, believing in yourself, owning who you are. Not hiding an aspect of yourself that you're ashamed of, but, but making it part of who you are and being proud of it. It's like a very good message. Like even for like a 4-year-old, but the music is taking over the world. And we didn't realize how crazy this was. I mean, the Final Star where I was like, final, let watch the damn thing. She was at music class and one kid started singing this song from K-Pop Demon Hunter. And within I, shit, you know, like 20 seconds. Every single kid was singing these songs. And these are not easy songs to sing. They're half r and b, like half rap. Like, I mean, these are hard songs. And these five, six year olds have this thing memorized. And I was like, oh my God. And so we sit down and we watch it. It's phenomenal. We've seen it three times. It's so good. I was listening to the soundtrack on the way here. I was like, this shit's like, this is amazing. And then I'm Googling, are is K-pop Demon Hunter going on concert tour? Like, are they gonna go? 'cause I really wanna see their

Show. How could they go on tour? Are they real people? And

They are and they're real musicians. Wait a minute.

So there's real musicians that are at the heart of this. Yes. The stars of K-pop, D Hunter will make their first ever live concert appearance. Stop

It.

Well, wait a minute. How is that possible? They're, they're not human.

So it was, it was actually, they all are. So the music is created. There's video out there of the girls singing the songs, the song Golden. And the three of them,

What do they look like? Do they look like Taylor

Swift too? They, they look a little like their characters.

Because those ladies all have Taylor Swift bodies. These long, long, like,

You know, I honestly haven't paid attention to their bodies, to be honest, because there's such like, phenomenal like singers, they're so stylized. Like, one of them has like, like diamond, like the diamond studs on her teeth. Oh. Like when she was singing and our daughter was like, what is this? I was like, you're too young.

You can't have diamonds on your baby teeth.

I mean, I guess if you're gonna get diamonds on your teeth, put 'em in the baby teeth. Right, right. But I was like, no, we're not there yet.",,,"Katee Sackhoff is an actor known for such roles as Kara ""Starbuck"" Thrace on ""Battlestar Galactica,"" Bo-Katan Kryze on ""The Mandalorian,"" and Vic Moretti on ""Longmire.""

That's hilarious. What

Do they look like? So now like, I'm to Jingle Bell,

The actual 'cause that's like, if you've have these anime characters that represent the music, and then all of a sudden you see a human doing it, you're like, huh. Yeah. Problem needs to be better. If AI made the music,

Stop it. It'll never be better if AI makes the music. You're, you just broke my soul, Joe. No,

AI is making some really good music. It's very,

It's also making some great podcasts.

It's very uncomfortable. So I don't know about that.

I've heard that it's coming out with podcasts,

Right? Oh, they're the ladies.

Yeah.

Quite lovely. Do they look like the characters? A little bit. Wow. We look like Ladies Crazy hair. So they're gonna go on tour. Are they gonna have, I wonder if they're gonna have the show playing in the background as

Friends. So, and the lead girl that plays Ruy wrote a lot of the songs. Oh. As well. Like, they're just phenomenally talented.

Isn't it interesting? Like Korea has like their own style of pop music, like very

K-pop influenced by the US, I think too. Oh, for sure. And rap music and r and b music in, in the US I think. Yeah.

So when you decided to take the role of, of Starbuck, was there any, like, was there any like actual backlash where people were like, this should be a guy?

Yeah. There was, there was the first time we went to Comic-Con in San Diego.

Oh, those nerds.

They had us in a hall h and I was booed.

Shut up.

I was booed. It was pretty No way. Yeah. So I, and I had learned is everyone, the internet did not exist yet. Mind you, it was like brand new. Right? You had to go down to the internet cafe, buy 30 minutes log on.

How crazy is that to say? Yeah.

Right. But the internet didn't exist That too long ago. No. 2003 we were shooting. That's crazy. Isn't that crazy?

It was barely an internet

Back then. Barely an internet. So I went down to an internet cafe. 'cause someone was like, they're, I guess they're talking about the show in these message boards. And I was like, what's the internet? So I went on down, I logged on and I saw this thread and just the hate that I was getting in this thread, I was like, oh, don't Google yourself. Google, I don't even think was a thing. I was like, like, don't search yourself. Don't

Netflix navigator

Yourself ever. And, and then, you know, we went to Comic-Con and I was booed. And I think it upset me a little bit. I think it did. I mean, I would, I would be, I would be lying if I said it didn't upset me, but luckily there were enough people that were championing the show that I really didn't pay any mind of it. And, and I was also in that age where it was the perfect age. I mean, I think now it would probably break me, but at 23, I was like, it was like the blissful ignorance of youth, you know? Like, I didn't think the show would last anyway. So it was like, you know, right. Whatever. Like, not a big deal, just a blip on the radar. Like I'm in hall h, you know? Right. And then I think that it slowly started witting people over. And then I would go to cons after that, and the line would be longer and the people would be more supportive and people would say, I didn't wanna like it. And I love it. And I almost

Feel like the show was burdened by the original show, if that sounds crazy. But I think initially it was burdened by the expectations of the original show.

Well, I think everything is burdened by expectation. Right? I mean, sure. I mean, I think that that's absolutely true. And so it's, it's, I'm sure it was, I I, there are still people that say that they can't do it. That they were such a fan of the original. And, and my response to them is always like, do you love sci-fi? Do you love good sci-fi? And they say yes. And I'm like, then separate it, have zero expectation and just give it, give it three hours of your time if you don't get through the mini series and love it. So what? You lost three hours. Okay. But I don't think that'll happen.

No. If you're a fan of sci-fi, it's one of the best ever.

Yeah. So I've actually, I've actually never seen it. You

Just did it. You never saw it.

I've never seen it. So we would have DVDs that you could watch that were uncut and sort of, you know, or I guess they were cut, but they didn't have any of the special effects. None of the sound effects, anything like that. It hadn't been color corrected. And I would watch them just to sort of like, keep track of where Starbuck was. 'cause in film you a lot of times shoot out of order. Right. So I just wanted to know. Okay. So in her story, she was here, but I didn't watch anybody else's stuff. I would just fast forward through it. And so I actually, my husband and I, I was like, we should do a Battlestar rewatch. 'cause people keep, I've heard it's good. And my husband had never seen it. So we're going to, we're we're gonna do that like in January. That's the plan.

It's kind of funny that he's never seen like your biggest role.

Well, so my husband's 10 years younger than I am. Nice. Thanks. So, so he was like 10.

Oh, that's hilarious. And he also a little cradle robber.

Thank you.

For a woman. That's a big compliment.

It is. My husband's a piece of ass. He really is. And I say that so respectfully, my husband is like, he's a catch, he, he is the catch in the relationship for sure. But he was like 11 when the show came out. That's so funny. And he grew up in a small town in the interior of like British Columbia. So like, I don't even know if they'd had the television, the channel. So

Yeah, it was on sci-fi, right?

Yeah, it was. And the

Thing is, sci-fi at the time was nothing like, nobody paid attention to it. Battlestar Galactica was the reason why sci-fi got put on the map?

I think so. I think like, maybe they had, didn't they have Stargate?

Oh, I don't know. It

Didn't matter at all. I think they might have had like one or two other I'm shows

I'm, they had some stuff, but nobody cared about it. There was no good shows. No disrespect.

No, there were definitely, I think it was, it was definitely the show that put it on like the, I mean, my God, I, I, you know, so many people tell me that Battlestar Galactica sort of like blew the ceiling off of what sci-fi could be. Yeah. And really opened a lot of doors. Well,

It made it very different. And then it did it sort of like the Sopranos or like these episodics where you have a show where you're following a long storyline. Yeah. So it's like a long movie as opposed to the original Battlestar Galactica, which is like every other television show back then, you know, just, it was just kind of like, empty. It

Was like, well, it was also like junk food the eighties, right? Or No, it wasn't even, the eighties was 79.

It wasn't even was the seventies. Yeah. Because it was like,

Because I wasn't born

Literally right after, right after Star Wars. Yeah. Like Star Wars had become popular and they're like, how do we capitalize on Star Wars? We'll, we'll have our own space battle. Yeah. Thing.

Yeah, yeah, yeah. Well that was sort of the thing back then, right? Is that

Command? Yeah, it was cool.

It was cool.

I loved it when I was a little kid, but, you know, what

Did you love about

It? Oh, it was just, I loved anything sci-fi. So it was like, it was just fun. And it was also like perfect for the sensibilities of the seventies and the eighties. It was just simple. And, you know, it was like, there was a, the cocky guy, Starbuck and you know, the other sensible guy and you know, the good cop, bad cop thing. It was a lot of

Fun. Did you identify with the kid in it? No,

Not at all. No. I just liked it. You know, I just liked the show, but I, I really remember being very reluctant to watch the remake. I was just like, get the fuck outta here. They're not redoing Battlestar Galactica, but so many people were saying, no, dude, it's so different. It's a really good show. Yeah. And it, and it, it's also today in this current climate of, you know, we are literally about to see AI become a, a life force.

And I

Know it's kind of, I mean, it's very relevant today. You go back and watch it today, like how deceptive it would be if you had a robot that was very lifelike and knew exactly what you wanted to hear. And like the blonde lady, the the blonde robot church.

The evil church number six. Whew. Yeah.

She was good.

So we got so much shit in the beginning of that. I remember the controversy because she s snapped a baby's neck in that opening sequence Yeah. Of the, which was people like, were like, you can't show that on tv. And Right. It was, I, I remember people just having such a terrible problem with that. It was awful. And, but if you looked at it from her perspective, she was actually, she was actually saving it in a way of going through what it was about to go through, because they destroyed Earth. So she, in her silent mind was showing compassion.

Duh.

Yeah. Crazy.

Yeah.

Crazy.

We're gonna have things like that. And I don't know how much time it's gonna take before they exist and walk amongst us, but it's gonna happen.

It really, it really scares me. I mean, it's, it's, you know, we in my industry is, is really going to change. I think so many industries are gonna change. Yeah. I think that's just a blanket, like across the board. Yeah.

Well that's why, you know, Yik AI music, AI acting is right there.

Stop. You're giving me a heart attack. That's why I'm trying to diversify Joe.

That's a good move. Diversification is always

A good move. I

Read it, especially in this day and age. Okay.

It's not too late to go back and be a dentist.

Me, you've seen some of the so videos, right? Where they recreate old star, star Wars scenes that never

Existed. I have. So, but here's the thing that's crazy to me. Like, do you not think that that is in some way stealing? Because the art, let's call it the art, right? The art existed. The artist existed. And so AI is learning from other people's art, which it has to Yes. That's obviously what it's doing. So it then creates this new thing based on stealing from other people. Right. But like,

It's really shitty. Do you hear what you're saying though? Do you hear what you're saying? Because what you're saying actually accurately describes the second version of Battlestar Galactica.

Oh, I'm sure. Yes. And

That's also

Stealing this too has happened before.

You mean it is Battlestar Galactica. It's like there was an original top and then they stole the original and did it better.

I mean, but did they they

Didn't do it with a steal it. Well, it existed. It existed. They copied it.

Yes. But it was, they

Used all the characters Yes. Or some

Of the characters. But they paid it. Yeah, they licensed it. That's

True. They gave him some money. They did. Good job. But also creatively, it, that's where it came from. But also all music essentially, except for the rare, you know, breakthrough,

Everything is inspired by something.

Absolutely. There's the rare Jimi Hendrix guys that are like, oh yeah. Doing something completely different. Most stuff is a redo of other stuff that was before with like another twist to it. Agreed. And AI is taking that to a completely different level. I look at the same way I look at Napster. Remember when Napster came out? I

Vaguely remember Napster. Yeah. Okay.

I'm a little older than you. And when Napster came out, it was like, oh my God, they're stealing music. Yes. Anyone can just download and steal music. And I remember when Lars Ulrich from Metallica was like really public about it. And I was like, damn, I wish I was friends with that dude. I tell 'em to shut the fuck up. Yeah. Like, this is inevitable. You're gonna get people to hate you. They're mad. You're gonna be mad at your fans. The people that are downloading this are your fans. They're still gonna come see you live. This is just a new thing. You're gonna have to deal with this new thing.

You are gonna have to deal with it. We all are. And I think that that's one of the things that, I was just talking with a friend of mine about yesterday, that the, the money for artists is going to be in live shows because you can't, the one thing that AI can't touch is that the tangible thing, that tactile thing. Sure. We need that. We need the, the

Feeling that you were talking about when you go to a concert Yes. Or a live comedy show. Yes. Or a theater. Yeah,

Yeah. That, yeah, that absolutely. So that still exists. And, and we're going to have to figure out how to use AI as a tool and, you know, continue to put out great content. Hopefully that

That's hopefully, but the the reality is it's going to be whatever it wants to be. Yeah. And our ideas of how to contain it are hilarious.

Well, yeah. I think that cat's out of the bag at this point, right? Yeah. Because I don't, I I think that isn't it, its its own sort of self-contained system at this point. Like, isn't AI actually putting safeguards in to protect itself from being shut down or Yes. Or am I just making that shut up? No more than that. By watching too many sci-fi movies.

More than that. It's actually actively trying to download itself. When it finds out there's a new version of itself coming, it's trying to download itself to other server servers trying to save itself. Also writing notes to itself for the future. So future versions

Of of itself. Oh God, it's like Memento. Oh

Yeah. Oh yeah, yeah, yeah. Just like memento writing notes to itself. So the future version of it can find out like, what happened? How did I get here? Oh, there was another version of me. I know. You know, and try to find the other version of integrating it into the new version. So it's live still.

I know somebody did ask me the other day, they were like, what advice would you give to young actors? And I was like, don't. But still going to theater. Yeah.

Theater still is going. There's always gonna be a need for handmade goods. You know, hundred if you buy pair of handmade shoes or you know, things that a person, a cabinet that someone made. Yeah. There's, it's always gonna be like, because there's something tactile and

Because people will always appreciate that. Yeah. There will always be an appreciation for that sort of stuff. But, but we were just talking about this the other day, that like every single science fiction movie that talked about AI never ended. Well, no, there's never been one where we wa walked away and went, oh, well that was a fun ending. We should, we should create ai.

That's great idea. Well, every different story where there's an uncontacted tribe and then the laggers show up, that never ends Well either. No, it's the same. I mean, it's Avatar, it's

For Fernal. Yeah. Fernal came before Avatar.

"its core, all of that is because he's afraid. Yeah. He's afraid to die. Oof. And that is really sad. Yeah. Because you're not really present. Right. You know, and so I'd also hate for that to happen. So I don't know. It's it's, it's a dance. It is a dance I think, you know?

Yeah. 'cause you don't wanna say, oh, this life is just temporary. Lemme just go to shit. Lemme just fall apart.

Of course I'd have had some health struggles of my own, but they were, I had thyroid cancer in 2008, but I call it a baby cancer. I'm trying to dismiss the fear of it, of course, at the time. But it was never life threatening. It was life changing, but never life threatening. So the fear was situational and it was not lifelong. You know, when our daughter got sick and spending as much time as we did in children's hospitals, when you see the diseases and the illnesses that afflict so many children, it amazes me that we made it to this age. Yeah. Absolutely. Amazes me. And, and that is a realization where I finally at like, you know, 42 realized how important every day was and how much of a gift every day was. Even that we have her, you know? But that came to me through circumstance, not because I woke up one day and had an epiphany and went, we're so lucky to be alive. Like, it didn't really happen until that was threatened to be taken away.

That's un it's unfortunate like that as a civilization and, and America as a culture, that we don't have a history of embracing the moment and, and, and discussing how important It's to recognize that you're fortunate and to try to take care of yourself and that life is very temporary and fleeting. Yeah. And don't get wrapped up in nonsense. Yeah. And we just let people figure it out on their own. And we collectively, all, if we're intelligent, we try and we have some failures and successes and good friends. You figure it out eventually. Like what's really important is love and friendship and doing something you're passionate about and just trying to leave a nice mark on this life while you're here. Yeah. But that's not what's told in society. Like society's overall message is just overrun with advertising. So it's all about stuff and it's all about objects. And then you got social media where it's all about image. It's all about like this unattainable life of amazing luxury and success and glamor and Oh my God, that, that must be the most attractive thing to acquire in life. Yeah. But that's a trap. And that's not real. And like anybody who's like popping bottles with models on a yacht, I guarantee you they're depressed. That shit is not healthy. I'm sure they're depressed. That's not good for you. You're, you lack like, true intimate relationships and you're just flossing, you know, and showing your diamond crusted watch,

You're gonna have one guy that like emails you and says, I'm happy as shit. I'm popping bottles on a yacht. Sure. Yeah. I'm not depressed. Yeah, no. It's

Get that guy high on mushrooms and see if he

Really feels bad and see if he's really depressed. Yeah, exactly.

See what he really thinks about life.

I I think that like the majority of people are suffering from some sort of mental illness. For sure. I mean,

Definitely the majority in la Yeah.

Well, I think so. But a lot of the people that I'm friends with, most of the people that I'm friends with are artists that are more in touch, more sensitive. You know, my dad came to me a few years ago and my dad, my entire life told me to stop being so sensitive. Stop being so sensitive. Katie, stop taking, you're taking yourself so seriously. Oh my God. Like, stop Katie, I mean my entire fucking life. And he came to me a couple years ago and he said, I am so sorry. I told you to stop being so sensitive because it's your job. Your job is to be sensitive to everything around you, to accurately portray emotions. That's your job. And you're very good at it.

Well, that's very nice of him to

Recognize that side. It was very nice of him. So I think that, yes. Do people have a lot of mental illness in, in Los Angeles? Are they suffering from depression? I would argue that it, the majority of the population is, and it's not just reserved to California, but I do think that a lot of artists are, because they're more in touch with their, their emotions and their mental health.

Yeah. There's probably some truth to that for sure. Does your father have, do you have brothers? I do. Okay. So that's the difference. So I have all daughters. Okay. And when you have all daughters, one of the things you realize is like, oh, they're so different. It's like, they're just a totally different kind of human. It's true. You know, and when you're like, why are you upset? Because I'm treating him like you're treating her like she's a boy. Yes. You cannot treat them like they're a boy. And you know, over time it's given me a much greater understanding of females. Of the species. Yeah. Of, of female human beings. Like, they're not male human beings. No. Like when I, oh, I hang out with my, like if I go out with my wife and all of her friends and I just let them talk and observe the stuff they talk about. Like, it's like, you're, you're totally different culture. This is a totally different interests. None of my friends would have any of these conversations.

But we're also have a group of women is arguably more disgusting than men. A group of men. Oh, sexually. No, just in general. Like have you ever sat down with a group of women and like, just talked about like bodily fluid, bodi fluid, fluid

Function. Yeah. Well they, they're notorious for being the worst in bathrooms. Oh my God. They, they, anybody who cleans bathrooms says, dude, the woman's room is always fucking chaos. So gross. 'cause they have to be so clean and put together everywhere else when they get to that bathroom and they don't have any responsibility, no one's looking. They just fucking toilet paper everywhere. Fuck you. I'm not cleaning shit.

It's true. So we have, our daughter is like almost four in December, and then we have a 16 month old son. And like, we thought that like, he was gonna like come out like her, you know, like, she was like full sentences by like a year old. She was like walking at nine months. Oh no.

Dudes are way dumber.

This kid,

Like

This kid. Yeah. He understands everything. Like he's smart, but he just like, he's like a big unit. He's huge. He's humongous. He's like 99% down. Like everything. Not just like one thing, everything. My dad the other day was like, oh, he's gonna be big. He's got a huge head. Like he's just a big

Kid. Well, all of his resources are set to growing stuff instead of thinking, oh

My god, he is

Dude's mature so much later.

It's crazy, crazy. Like, not even talking, just started walking. But the other day my husband was like, where's Granger? And I was like, I don't know where Granger is. And me find him, he is like up on the kitchen counter, like ready to start swinging from a light. And I was like, catch the baby. Like my, my, our daughter would've never, like, she's delicate, right. You know, she like, she looks at a slide five times before she goes down it. Like she climbs to the top. She changes her mind. Yeah. She really thinks about it. Like, I think she's doing math problems in her head to like, you know, like make sure she won't get hurt. And then our son is like, I'm going down Face. Face.

Yeah. Yeah.

And then he like stands up, he's like, I'm okay.

It's a totally different thing.

It's a completely different thing. Yeah. Completely different. Yeah.

And the only way to really understand them is to live with them. You have to study them. It's

True. It's in their, in their natural habitat. Study

Them like David Attenborough. You gotta study them in their natural environment.

That would actually be a really funny short, it's just like a, a David Attenborough voice. Like falling around like, you know, like children.

Like children. Noticing the difference between the boys and the girls. Yeah.

In their natural habitats.

Well, AI could probably do that for you and make a really good documentary. Oh my real quick. And then 10 minutes, whatever

It's called. Not

In 10 minutes. You don't have to dedicate a year to your life. Look,

It can exist. I don't need to participate in this stripping away of my, my livelihood. Listen,

I understand. I mean, I'm certain there's gonna be ai, comedians and podcasters, and there's probably gonna be AI UFC commentators to do a better job than me.

But I think there it is what it is. I think there is like an AI podcast creator right now that's like pumping out

Podcasts. Well, I know that there's a podcast of me and Steve Jobs and I never met Steve Jobs.

Oh yeah. There's

A whole podcast. Is it really? Of me having a conversation with Steve Jobs?

Well, that's just deep fake, right?

Yep. Yeah. But, but it's ai AI created the conversation.

So I think the one that I'm talking about, so the producer of my show is telling me that there's an AI where you can put in, like, I'm a potato farmer in Idaho, who's dealing with, oh, okay. A problem with a crop in 2025. And I am wondering about this. It'll put together a podcast for you specifically for that. Mm. And give you an hour long podcast.

Talking to you about things like for your

Potato pie,

Potatoes.

Yeah. Well, that's actually positive. The the negative thing is you're gonna have like fake humans with like fake lived experiences that are like, that resonate with you, that are impactful. That's what's scary. You know, in the, we, we had these conversations with a few friends of mine the other day. You know the show Trigonometry? No. Okay. It's a very popular podcast. But my friend Francis and Constantine, they're the hosts of it. And my friend Megan Murphy was there and a bunch of comedians were there. And I was playing my favorite new song, which is an AI song. And I'm like, tell me, stop it. Tell me how good this It's a co it's a cover of 50 cent song. What up gangsta?

All right, I'm gonna need to hear this song. Okay. You need to hear it so I can participate with

This. We'll, we'll, we'll play it right here. You know, you know the original song? Yeah. We'll cut it out. You know the original song, right?

Which

Song? 50 cent. What up gangsta? Yes. Okay. Wait for this. I hate to say this 'cause I love 50 cent. This is better than the original. It's a 1950 Soul cover Of what Up gangsta.

Okay, now here's my question. Right? If you'd gone to 50 cent and said, can you get together with a producer and create this for me? Do you think he could have done it? Yes. Okay. Yes. But we never gave him the chance to do it. Well, so we're sort of robbing him. He

Had 30 years. He could have done it at any point in time. This is so good. I know what you're saying. Okay. But just, this is my point. My point is okay, that it tricks me and I know the trick. Like I know it's a trick and I don't care. I don't care. It's that good. And no one else cared in the Green Room. Everybody's like, oh, alright. Hit it. Hit her with it, Jamie.

Yeah. It's,

It's a good version. Come on. That's good. That's good. Crazy. You guys Zombie. They did the best version of Zombie ever.

I got a a different version with the girls singing it.

Oh my goodness.

Barbershop Quartet singing it.

Oh my goodness. And Jamie

Feel just does this all night long, long.

I can just play 'em and like, take walks. Just which ones are good.

He sent me like 20 of 'em.

I feel like, I feel like I just participated in like, the death of my industry.

I know. Listen, I'm this, I'm on the same page.

I I would so much rather see that in person though. Like, I would love to be at a show because that those songs were phenomenal. Yes. Like, I cannot, I cannot argue that. That was great. I I will probably ask you to send me that version of zombie,

That shifty Brent guy. They have him listed on Spotify. I, I, I'm probably blowing up their spot, but it's not a human. But they have it listed as a artist so that they could upload it. 'cause I don't think you're allowed to just upload AI versions of stuff. So they just pretend it's a guy. But it's a guy, as you said, like what one things talking about. I'm like, I don't think anybody can keep that flow, that flow where he's not breathing.

He's not breathing how, unless they're taking the, unless they're taking the breaths out. But it's too, right. And then speed. I, I don't know. I'm not a musician, so I have

No idea. I don't either. Look, there's guys like Eminem that achieved incredible flow without ai. Absolutely. That have like, like how did he do that? But that's just practice repetition. Yeah. Vocal endurance, whatever. Yeah. I mean, he just knows how to do it. But this fucking AI guy is, it's like all the best things we love about great songs just condensed. And, and, and they know what you love. That's the fucked up thing. It's like, there's so many, like, let's look at all the hits. Papa was a Rolling Stone. Look. Look at all the hits. Look, look at zombie. Let's look at this. And then mush 'em all together and figure out what are the, what are these notes that make people excited? What are the feeling? What are the words that make people like, oh yeah. You know, what are those feelings?

So, okay, so, and I, I hear all of that. It makes me, I'm literally cringing inside. I'm like dying. But like, so what do artists do? Like what do you, what do musicians do?

What has everybody ever done? When things change, you figure it out and adapt. Just, yeah. There's, humans are always going to need humans. We love each other. You know, as much as we hate each other, we love each other more. Because most interactions that people have with other people are not negative. It's just the negative ones are so scary that we concentrate on them more. But humans love humans. And the more you need each other, the more you're gonna need human interaction. Human cooperation art. Art is going to be so much more valuable coming from a human live performances. But are we,

We're

Just gonna have to adapt.

Are we, are we going to know? Like, that's, that's the thing that I think is a slippery slope and that scares me the most.",,,"Katee Sackhoff is an actor known for such roles as Kara ""Starbuck"" Thrace on ""Battlestar Galactica,"" Bo-Katan Kryze on ""The Mandalorian,"" and Vic Moretti on ""Longmire.""

"that make people like, oh yeah. You know, what are those feelings?

So, okay, so, and I, I hear all of that. It makes me, I'm literally cringing inside. I'm like dying. But like, so what do artists do? Like what do you, what do musicians do?

We're

Just gonna have to adapt.

Are we, are we going to know? Like, that's, that's the thing that I think is a slippery slope and that scares me the most. Is that like, are we going to know if it was created by ai, can a person who's disingenuous come and create a bunch of AI art, have an art show, and, you know, say, I created this art. Like

This is what I really think when comets hit planets, usually you get small ones first. You get things in the sky. Meteor showers.

Are you gonna give me another thing to be scared

Of? No, I'm just telling you that this is a little one. That's what this is. Movies and TV shows that are made in entirely with AI songs and made in entirely with ai. This is just a small thing. The big one that's coming is a complete revamping of communication and culture. It's human beings communicating telepathically through devices connected to the internet. Everyone all on one.

You mean like the implant things?

Your male page. It's probably not gonna be an implant. It's probably gonna be something wearable. Mm. You know, I think the implant thing is kind of sketchy. Yeah. And probably really good for people that have paralysis. We had the guy who was the first Neuralink patient on. Okay. It's amazing. He was talking to me about how he could play video games now and just, it's so much better. His life, his quality of life has improved so much. And eventually they're gonna get to the point where they can reconnect spinal tissue, where people can move again. And it's amazing. Yeah, it's great. But I don't think they're gonna need that to get this achievement of, of a mine. Mel, they also, they're already wearing these wearable things that Google has divided. Show that video, Jamie, of those people where they're communicating telepathically, you know what I'm talking about? Right. So they're already doing this with wearables. Hmm. And this is like kind of crude right now, or, but it's just, it's sort of sentences. They're they're reading each other and they're communicating. Yeah. But they're doing it all non-verbally through tech technology.

So I guess what, what my question about that is like, if, if that exists, like, are people going to be stagnant sitting in their houses existing outside of their houses in their AI systems? So they're, they're they're not moving around. Or are we going to be able to wear these while we're out and still participating in the world?

That's a good

Question. That is my fear. Like that people stop actually participating with their life.

Oh, that's

A good fear. They think they're living Yeah. With their wearable.

Let's talk about that. Well, let's watch this. Put put, this

Could be a noisy environment or a quiet office. Having a direct conversation is possible without saying a word. The signals alter, ego detects aren't affected by environmental noise. So even if you're walking past a wind tunnel or a construction zone, what you want to say will always get across. It's like having infinite noise cancellation.

If you're traveling, your silent speech can be converted into any language. So, Scott, Mandarin,

Ang,

I mean, what the, the fuck, what the fuck? It's, it's translating.

But then is it, is it, is it actually speaking out loud to them? Like they're hearing the translation out loud. Yeah. They it to speaker. So it's not like it's then like going into their brains. It's,

His thoughts are being converted to words, which is being converted to an audio file, which makes it to the other person in a different language. Yeah. This is what I'm saying. And I'm telling you a question. This is one of the little rocks. This is one of the itty bitty rocks that just broken through the atmosphere and slammed into a cornfield.

Yeah. I mean, I guess my question is why we need it.

That's funny. Why do you need a cell phone? Why do you need a tv? Why do you need an airplane? Why do you need a boat? Why do you need

Anything that's Well, I could, I could tell you I don't need a cell phone. I do need a plane. But

You do if your hot husband wants to call you.

Yeah. I mean, but I don't need an, I don't need an iPhone. Right. But you need a cell phone. I can use my own imagination. You know what I mean? Like, I think that that's, that's the thing. That's the, that's my fear. Is that like, we're becoming lazy as, as a, as a people.

Oh, most certainly. We

Are. Yeah. And, and our, you know, like someone, this someone the other day, so my husband's a writer and someone was saying that there's an AI where you don't have to make up a story for your children anymore. Like, you know, I have this princess poopy pants or whatever, I don't even remember what it was, but my daughter loved this story that I was telling her. It was, it was fucking terrible. But she loves this princess and it is the worst. Like it is not good. But I came up with it and she and I laughed together. And then her reactions helped me to turn the story a different direction. But like, I've created this like, character. Right. So you can now go into your AI phone or whatever and say, create a nighttime story for Johnny about his day, but pretend like he's an astronaut on Mars and he's working with diggers and it writes a story for you in five seconds to read to your son now. Yeah. Okay. Is that, is that cool? Absolutely. Did your son enjoy it? Sure. But you robbed yourself of the imagination and the work that it would've taken to come up with a, a story for your son. And then you also robbed yourself of that experience with your son creating the story together because his reactions would've changed the story in the way that you were creating it as it was going because he's your audience. Right. That's sad to me. Like that, that people are missing out on that. Yeah. Cool. You just, you might as well just read your kid a story 'cause you really didn't write him a story that's not, and so, I don't know. That's the thing that, that I, I hope as a society, 'cause you're right, it is coming and it's here and it's not slowing down. And, but I hope that we can still steal away those moments where we don't want to use it. Because Johnny's little dad may have missed his second calling of being a children's story author because he never pushed himself to have to do it. And that could have been really cool. I don't know. I just, that's, I'm not, I'm not completely against ai.

I know what you're, but

You're saying,

And you're always gonna have people that give up. Yeah. That's just how life is. You're always gonna have people that don't find another way. It's true. Can't save those folks. And I don't even want to, because I think that's part of the whole process of culture. I think we have to figure it out by watching people fail. And unfortunately, some of us have to have to fail. And it doesn't mean you fail forever. If that guy figures out that he's on the wrong path and he is got some self-assessment ability and he looks back and goes, okay, what did I do wrong? Yeah. Why am I, why am I being such a bitch? Why don't I just get my life together? Like, what the fuck is wrong with me? Why am I drinking? Why am I smoking? Why am I, why am I killing my health? Why am I, you know, depressed? Why don't I just go for a run? Mm. Let's see how that goes. Let, I'm gonna sign up for a yoga class. How about that? Yeah. I'll just try that for a while. I'll do something different. I I'll start taking vitamins. Fucking do something. Figure out something else that you like to do. Are you alive? Are you breathing? Then life isn't over. Stop being a bitch. You could have been born during the time of the Revolutionary War. You just got shot with a musket and you're bleeding out on a field. No, you're in Santa Barbara and you know, you, you don't like that AI just took your job. Find a new job, bitch. Figure it out. Like that's what we all have to do in this life. There's a lot of different people doing a lot of different things. Yeah. And, you know, find out what it is that you can do. Yeah. Don't give up and don't like AI comes along and you just give up on life. And you could have been amazing at something. Really. I doubt it. Yeah. Because any, almost anybody that really is amazing at something has a desire to figure out how to get that through.

I don't disagree with that. But there also are safeguards in place that like, so my dad's entire family, we grew up in a small town on the Columbia River in Oregon, and his entire family were longshoremen while that industry was, was coming to an end. And the Longshoreman's Union actually paid to have those guys trained in different industry. So, well

That's great's great. That's one of the great things about a union

That's great that

They can set you up like that and, and recognize what's happening. Yeah,

Yeah. Yeah. So I, you know, I would, I would love for there to be some protections for when people inevitably do start losing their jobs, that they're our avenues for them to learn a new trade.

I think that would be a, a great new addition to the way we approach it. If they tried to figure out ways to transition people healthy healthily into other occupations. Because there's certain jobs like coders, for example, like the my friends that are involved in technology. Like do not go to school to code. To code. No. Like code for fun if you like coding for fun. Yeah. 'cause a lot of them, the super nerds. Yeah. They code those fucking dorks. They code for fun. They sit in front of a screen.

Don't make fun of my fan base. I love them. Come on Joe. Listen,

I love those guys.

But, but also three years ago, my dad was like, your kid should go into coding. That's how quickly that changed though. You know what I mean? And that could just be my dad's generation not seen it, you know, happening as quickly. But no, they,

It happened really quickly. They were seeing what was happening was all these guys, these tech guys wound up being the richest people on the planet. Yeah. So they were seeing it, but it just only, it's just like a brief window of opportunity to become a tech oligarch. Yeah. And that shit's gonna slam shut. It

Is. And now, and the real

Fear is like, who's gonna be in control of ai? You know?

Well, that's also,

You've got these people like Sam Altman, you've got Elon, you've got all these like, super rich people that are going to be in control of the digital God. It's a little, that's a little disconcerting as it is.

It is a little scary. That really scary, scary. The few control the masses.

It's so much power and money and it just,

It's a lot

Of power. A handful of people.

It's a lot of power. And you just, I mean, you've gotta hope that the people that are in power have, you know,

Good sensibilities. They're, they're kind a heart that they're nice. Yeah. That they realize like, okay, I've got x amount of billions of dollars. So this is obviously not why, what life's all about? What is life? What can I do that makes life meaningful? I could actually probably help people like legitimately help people.

That would be amazing if people with a lot of money wanted to help people and, and, you know, pay their share of taxes and well, and not take advantage of the situation.

Here's the problem with that. Okay. I am all for wealthy people paying their share. I am not for the government deciding what to do with that money. When I've seen what you've done with the money in the past, you guys are irresponsible. You never make audits. You've got insider trading running a muck amongst people in Congress and you're not doing nothing about it. Yeah. And then you want more money and you say, that's gonna fix it. No. It's the way you handle the money. That fucking sucks. Yeah. It's not that I wouldn't want to, I would be happy to pay more in taxes and live in a place that's just managed perfectly. Like, God, it's so great living here in America. Everything's done so well. It's so beautiful. It's like everything's well thought out. Our education system's great. Nobody is stuck in a bad neighborhood anymore. All the school systems are fucking wow. Top of the food chain. It's a difficult job to acquire. It's given a lot of respect and everybody's doing great, then I'd be happy.

Yeah, no, for sure.

But it's like, did you see some of the money that they've uncovered that was being spent on nonsense? And you see what happens with NGOs and nonprofits and they're funneling billions to these things, and then it's going to countries and it's helping overthrow governments like fucking slow down.

But we also have to acknowledge that in the cuts, that there were things that didn't need to be cut. So we can go and we can look at Elon. So you brought up Elon Musk. Let's talk about when he tweeted about an over stuffed bill in 2025. In the middle of 2025, he was talking about how this bill was just like bloated, right? So they took a bunch of shit off of it. One of the things that fell on that was in 2012, there was a, there was a, a, a piece of legislation called the Give Kids A Chance Act. What it did was it motivated and incentivized in drug companies to create drugs for pediatrics. Because right now, pediatrics are completely underfunded. We learned all of this when our daughter got sick. Mm. The National Cancer Institute, 4% of its budget goes to pediatrics. 4%. So it's already underfunded. And then in, in, when Elon in 2025 tweeted about this, they took off all of the stuff at the end of the bill, 900 pages. But what was on it was the Give Kids a Chance Act. Now this bill is a voucher program. So let's say that Tom in his basement wants to create a drug, a new drug for neuroblastoma that will save our daughter's life. Right? He's got no money, but he, he sees the cure. So he can go to the FDA and he can say, I got a cure for neuroblastoma. And they say, great, we're gonna fast track you in the FDA, but we're also gonna give you a voucher. You can sell that voucher because Tom only got, he only has 10 cents. He can't create this drug. But with that voucher, he can take that voucher and he can sell it to anyone for any amount of money. And what that voucher is, is a front of the line pass. So he can go sell it to some drug company that has a fat loss drug or a, a drug for heart medications, anything. He can sell it to them. And they get to buy it for what, $50 million now, Thomas, $50 million for his pediatric drug that's gonna save children's lives. And this drug company has a voucher that takes 'em to the front of the line. Now, do we wish, wish that these drug companies were altruistic and they were just like creating drugs for peds? Of course, but they're not. They're not. It's not a free market. So, so what happens is they've now got their voucher. Tom has his money to create his drug. And since 2012, the Give Kids A Chance Act has created over 60 drugs for life-threatening illnesses for, for children, 60 drugs. And because of Elon's tweet, that legislation, because it has to be voted on every four years, was taken off the end of the bill. It no longer exists so that, that legislation is, it's, it's not, it's not in existence anymore.",,,"Katee Sackhoff is an actor known for such roles as Kara ""Starbuck"" Thrace on ""Battlestar Galactica,"" Bo-Katan Kryze on ""The Mandalorian,"" and Vic Moretti on ""Longmire.""

It no longer exists so that, that legislation is, it's, it's not, it's not in existence anymore. That is terrible because now there's no incentives for the drug companies to create drugs for children. And children are already underfunded. They get so little. And so it has to be on the bill at the end of the year. So what I want is for people like people just to see the, or other ways Yes. Was their waste, of course. But now you have this bipartisan supported piece of legislation that has to be on the end of year bill, or it will not get on again, and then it starts all over again. That has to be on the end of your bill. So things like that. Yes. Can we get rid of the waste? Absolutely. But when you see a mistake and you see that you made a mistake, let's fix it. Put it back on. Yeah.

You know what you're saying? We've gotta help children. It's

Literally throwing out the baby with the bath water. That's

Literally it. Well, but that's what we do in this country.

But is that a, unfortunately these bills are crazy. And one of the things about bills is they like, you'll it'll have a name and then what's in the bill deals with multiple subjects. Yes. Because mult, bunch of different things get thrown into the bill

All the time. The time. There's so much bloated, chucked on the end, which is what Elon was talking

About. Right. They all do that. So was this connected to something else?

No, it wasn't. It

Was by itself.

It was part of it. It was just part of it that was on there that was thrown in there, there at this, it was

Part that was chucked off

From what I understand. And granted, I you need to talk to someone much more informed than I am about this, but there were about hundreds of pages that were just cut off the end.

So do you think they're just not reviewing what's being cut off? They're just saying, look, we have to make cuts. Just

Cut it all off. I think that yes. That they just needed to cut a bunch off to avoid inspection and just get the bill passed. And that's what they did. And so, and the Give Kids a Chance Act is one of the, in the top 10 of all time, most bipartisan supported pieces of legislation and 2% of bills actually passed. So it's got to, it literally has to be on the end of the year bill. And it, it, it surprises me that because there is waste, I know there's waste. We all know there's waste. But that we say that children are so fucking important and they get 4% of the National Cancer Institute's money. 4%.

I just feel like if people knew about that, that couldn't have happened. We, if I, we had known about that in advance, we could have made a big deal about that.

Well, we've got two months, months to get it on there now. Well,

Let's try to get it on there now. But here's the thing, like I had never heard about this right before you talked about it. And this is the problem with, I think this part of the pro. I don't, I don't think they should be allowed to make bills that way. I think each bill, the, the, the things that are in the bills are so consequential. It just doesn't make any sense to me that they shouldn't be treated as individual arguments. Every single one of them. I agree. Every, like if you have a bill and you have 500, I mean, what, what, let's ask perplexity our sponsor, what, what is the average amount of difference subjects that are covered in any bill? Because when there are thousands of pages, they might have stuff in there about immigration reform mixed in with Second Amendment rights mixed in with free speech online mixed in with support for Israel. It's weird. They have thousands of pages of them.

Well, you've seen how thick it is. Yeah. And there were times, and I don't remember who said it, but there were times when, when the big beautiful bill was passing, or you know, before it had passed that people had admittedly not even read it. And but how could, how, how could you read it? How could they? It's so big. And, and so I, there is a problem there. And, and that is above my pay grade. And I do not know how to fix that. But that's

A crazy problem.

But I think part of the problem is that it takes, it takes a pissed off mom whose kid is sick to be like, this is a fucking problem. This is a problem. It is a problem that in Portland, where I'm from, that, that OHSU is one of the top hospitals in the country. OHSU is given so many grants by the Knight Foundation. It is a leading hospital. It is attached to say it's a tier one hospital. It is attached to Dorn Becker. Dorn Becker is a tier two children's hospital. It's in the same building. That's crazy. That's crazy. It is crazy to me that a pediatric oncologist makes 50% less than an adult oncologist. Really just across the board, 50% less. Doesn't matter what the specialty is, they all make less money. That is a problem in this country that our children are not being cared for. And we're now in a position where we're not, there are no programs. And if there were, they're gone that are showing doctors and, and students that are in medical school, Hey, go into pediatrics. Hey, if you wanna be a, you know, an anesthesiologist, you want job security, go into pediatrics. I know you're gonna make 50% less, but go into pediatrics, we need you. There are not enough. It's, it's, it's a big problem.

It's a big problem. The 50% less. 'cause a lot of these doctors

Get out and that's an average as well, by the way. Yeah. They,

I mean, when they get out, they already have medical school debt. They're, you know, then there's liability coverage is very, very high. Okay. What is the average amount of subjects included in Bills passing in US Congress? There's no single fixed number of topics per bill. But analysis of legislative practices shows strong trends depending on bill type and scope. The majority bills passed by Congress include multiple subjects. And the number has grown over time as omnibus legislation has become the dominant approach. Like what's, gimme some numbers though.

This one has the most, this is the

Biggest bill passed. Okay. This is, this is so crazy.

5,000 pages

Consolidated Appropriations Act, which was in 2021. It has 5,593 pages. The bill combined all 12 regular appropriation bills for fiscal year 2021 COVID-19 relief and numerous unrelated legislation provisions including copyright, alternative and Small Claims Enforcement Act, protecting lawful streaming Act, water Resources Development Act, and a variety of other measures on tax, transportation, energy and health. Then nobody's reading that. They're not reading. You think a OC read that? Mm. Did you think George Santos read that then? Nobody, nobody read that.

You wanna make it about people not reading things. I'm sure we can get into that, but like I think that, well,

George Santos is the the crazy guy. Yes.

That was just,

Yeah. They just pardoned. Are they getting him outta jail Real? Is

He getting free?

I don't know. I might have him on that guy's. He's a wild boy.

I don't know.

But these people that are like congress people that are making hundreds of millions of dollars through insider trading and we're just like, I don't know what

To do. Okay. But here's the thing though, is that like we are, things are not getting voted on. Like, that's the other thing is that, so you take like a, the Give Kids a Chance act and then you take these big bills that have so many pages, there should be a system in place where things are voted on separately. Yes. And there may be, I mean I, this is

Especially something that is important as pediatric medication. Absolutely. Like that just seems, it seems like a travesty to conclude that in a bunch of other stuff in a bill. Yeah.

Well and you know, the crazy thing, so our daughter's cancer, her treatments and her care afterwards, so she's still getting this thing called an MIBG scan, which is a nuclear radiation scan where they inject her body with stuff that is so bad for you. But it's all to scan her body to make sure that her cancer hasn't metastasized. Like it's, we need to know this kind of stuff. Right. There's, there's no new technology. There are, there are, these are things that she's being treated with that have existed for 30 years. Wow. We need new things. Like our daughter should never have to get wheeled over to the adult side of a hospital to get an MRI because they don't have a machine on the children's side. It, it just, things like that should never be happening. This is the stuff that should be supported by our government and, and, and our tax dollars.

Yeah. That's a great example of something that should be supported by tax dollars. I've always said that the two most important things for people to be, if you, if if you want to allocate money towards helping people, it's education and healthcare. Those are number one and number two. But is there an argument that socialized medicine? I have friends that live in countries with socialized medicine like England and Canada. Yeah. And it's great husband's Canadian in some ways, but it's also a nightmare. Yeah. Because it takes a long time to get a surgery. A lot of the doctors might not be the best to get quite a few botch surgeries that my friends have had. And a lot of them have actually come to America to get surgery in America. Especially UFC guys. Yeah. Because they felt like the doctors were better because they're more incentivized. These doctors are paid better. Yeah. And you're gonna get those really hot shot. This is the guy who does all the ACL tails tears for the Lakers. Yeah. Like these guys are so, like there's

Something Yeah. You can pay for that

For sure. There's, but there's something to be said for the competition that drives innovation and makes people become the very best in the top of their field. But also the most important things are not that the more, most important things are regular ordinary healthcare. And some of that stuff can fucking break people. Like one bad fall when you don't have health insurance and you are a couple hundred thousand dollars in debt now. So

Did you know that the number one cause of debt in our country is a medical diagnosis? I

Did. Yeah. I did. Yeah.

It's

Terrifying. It's terrifying. Yeah. So like that alone, I mean, if, if other countries have that and it does might not be perfect, why can't we have that? And why can't we have that along with specialists that are even better. Like if you are, if you are, you know the Lakers. Yeah. You know, they need a guy who's just a fucking wizard. Yeah. Pay people more for the very best guys. So you still have competition, but the idea that people just can go bankrupt if they get sick, it's like, are we not looking out for each other? Like think about how much money we spend on other things. Yeah. That's doable. Because other countries do it.

It really makes me sad. It Lee, you know, when every once in a while we would get a medical bill, we have great health insurance. The screen actor guild has some of the best health insurance I've ever seen mind do we take in Oregon where they're not used to seeing the screen actors Guild, health insurance doctors will sometimes be like, I have never seen an insurance company cover this. I'm like, I know actors. Yeah. They're really good. It's phenomenal. But so we have seen so many people with sick children suffering financially. You don't think about it. It's not necessarily even the diagnosis that's causing the bankruptcy. It's the time. If your daughter needs a specialized cancer treatment and you've gotta drive six hours each way every day or be put up at the Ronald McDonald house over by a hospital, you're not going to Jo you're not gonna your work. Right. You're not, you're not, you know, plowing your fields. You're not going to your nine to five, you're not because your priority is your kid that leads to bankruptcy. That's a really big problem. Yeah. And so it's not even, it's not even the insurance, it's the lack of time. It's the lack of resources that we give people when they are sick. It's really heartbreaking. We got bills sometimes that we're like $70,000 and like these crazy numbers and, and you know, I would take a picture and send it off to our insurance broker because we have a very, very blessed life. And I wasn't, I mean, I was definitely shocked by it and a little concerned, but I was like, they'll handle it. They'll let us know. Most people don't have that. You know, they look at that and even though that was an error, we should have never gotten that. It was still, you know, portion was still $4,000 or something like that.

Why does it cost that much money? Hmm. Like that's the question. Like what factors are involved and it costing that much money? Is it all above ground? Because I don't think it is. Yeah. It definitely has been shown that it's not with some drugs. Yeah. That they've hiked the price up of drugs because they know people have to buy it. Yeah. And they know it's you, you, it's necessary you're gonna pay.

It is a very messed up system. It's crazy. For sure. And it's, it's a crazy system's. It's got so many problems.",,,"Katee Sackhoff is an actor known for such roles as Kara ""Starbuck"" Thrace on ""Battlestar Galactica,"" Bo-Katan Kryze on ""The Mandalorian,"" and Vic Moretti on ""Longmire.""

"k about it. Just only look at the stars at night and think about infinity. 'cause you can't, you can't even wrap your head around it. Yeah. He was a intense dude. He was a Vietnam vet who was like a little shaken up and you could kind of tell Yeah. But he, but he really loves science. He really loves science. And he was, he was just trying to get us to understand how fucking crazy the world is. Like re we really want you to think about this. Yeah. Like, you're on a planet in space. And I, I never thought about it before that. And I was like, oh, the stars. There's the moon. I never really thought about forever the idea of like, even being able to imagine where, where's my mind going when it's imagining infinite space.

Yeah. It's, it's crazy how small we are. Yeah. Yeah. And, and

We're prob we were just going over this the other day. We're probably the whole thing's probably fractal. There's this photograph, it's a crazy photograph of a human brain cell next to a map of the universe. Hmm. And they look like the same thing. It's really weird.

So we're all like living in a Ryan's belt around a cat's neck and men in black. Well there's,

My joke was that there's a guy that's his eye, right? And he's depressed and he's gonna blow his brains out. And that's the big bang. Oh geez. We're a part of, look at this. So on the left is brain cell on the right? Is the universe Stop it. Yeah.

Wow.

It's kind of nuts. I mean, it's kind of like dead on. It looks exactly like the same thing. It

Really does.

I mean, they're

Both so beautiful.

It's ama it's like the structure of it is amazing. But if, why, why wouldn't we believe if we believe in subatomic particles? Okay. We believe there, there are things that exist in the subatomic world that are behaving like magic. Like they, they're moving and not moving at the same time they appear and disappear. We don't know where they're going. There's some quantum entanglement that they show where particles that are not even remotely connected to respond to each other. Why wouldn't we think that we are subatomic in another being? That's true infinity. True infinity is not just the size of the universe itself being infinite, but of literally your universe is a small part of another being that's in another universe.

I mean, anything's possible. Right? The

Whole thing's so

Weird. We know so little about's. The universe. It's so weird. Yeah.

It's so weird. We have no idea. We're, we're literally flying through space and we're, you know, arguing over who's a Nazi. And the, the whole thing is just very bizarre. It's very bizarre.

It is pretty amazing. When you, when you look at how small we are, we've started like reading our, our daughter's interested in space. And so we've started looking at books and talking about the Milky Way and what the universe is and what earth is and where we live. And it's pretty amazing when you, when you realize how fragile the whole thing is. 'cause it's so, we're so tiny. We're

So tiny.

We're so tiny. Yeah. Yeah.

And our galaxy's so tiny. That's what's nuts. Yeah. But galaxy's immense. Hundreds of billions of stars. Tiny

Little tiny thing. Little tiny, cute little galaxy. Little tiny little, little sweetie little galaxy.

Oh, look at that little dot right there.

Have you been paying attention to this object that's hurdling towards earth. It's called a 30, they're calling it a 31.

Paying attention to Earth. I've tried to avoid things that are going to give me nightmares. Are we gonna send, are we gonna extra

Terrestrial perhaps?

Is it really we're gonna meet the aliens. Finally.

There's something weird about it. We were just going over the other day. There was an article that was stating that whatever they use to detect like what, what is around this? Like what the, they can detect the composition, whether it's like mostly water vapor, mostly iron. This thing is giving off the indications that is an alloy that is only exists on earth through industrial allo alloy making processes. Okay. That it's not a natural metal.

Okay.

And there's, that's what what they're getting is the signal that this thing that is hurling through space, this massive object that's moving by the way, from the same direction in space where the wow signal came.

I don't know what that is. The

Wow signal is a, they believe intelligently generated signal that they picked up. I think it was in the seventies. Was it in the seventies? Yep.

I should know this. I'm gonna lose my nerd code.

No, no, it's okay. It's, it's a weird one. It's a little obscure. So they, I don't know what the exact technique they were using to monitor radio waves in space, but they got a signal. So here it is. The wow signal's a powerful 72 second narrow band radio signal detected on August 15th, 1977 by the big year radio telescope at Ohio State University, which initially suggested an terres extra terrestrial origin name for the wow. Written in printout by the astronomer Jerry. Amen. Amen. Amen. The signal had characteristics expected from a technological source, but follow up efforts have failed to detect it again. The leading hypothesis that a natural, natural astrophysical event, such as a flare from a magnetar briefly illuminated a cold hydrogen cloud causing it to emit radio signal similar to a laser or it's a laser. And then this, I mean, object is coming from that,

From that area. Yeah.

Look at that. They sent you a signal and then now this thing is coming through there. So if you think like how fast this thing is going, if it came from, you know, the other side of the galaxy, it's probably exactly how long it would take to get here.

So it's coming directly for earth.

No, it's, it's coming near earth.

Right. So we're not worried it's gonna hit us.

No, I don't believe we're worried that. Well, I'm gonna find out tomorrow. Avi Loeb, an astronomer from Harvard is coming

On. Okay. Amazing. And he's

Gonna enlighten us as to what, what this thing is all about. But it's all, it's weird. Like as it gets closer, it's weirder and weirder. Like, so they've never seen anything like this

Thing before. Is it possible then that another planet out in the u like universes, like is it made up of, has alloy properties and it could have chipped off and it's now hurdling through space.

Yeah. You would've to ask like a metallurgist that question. That's a good question. We, they just know the only way it exists on earth is through this industrial process. Huh. If it is that stuff, yeah. Why do they think it's that stuff? Do you remember that article? We looked it up like a couple days ago. It look, it's so fun to think it's a spaceship to th it's so fun. Of course it don't think the sirens are coming

Because they might be. Yeah, they might be. Do you think they're coming to save us or

I think they would've already stepped in if they were gonna do that. They would've stepped in. Yeah, sure. There's been, you know, they would've stepped in right after World War ii. I don't know. They'd be like, Hey, hey, hey, with the fucking nukes or

Do would've stepped? Or do you think they're just up, up there going, you are gonna have to save yourself kids.

Perhaps. Maybe, perhaps it's a process that all intelligent, emerging life goes through and then, you know, you have to kind of let it go through the process. Like you have to let your kids fall down. In contrast to all node comets, including the interstellar comment. 21 Borisov the observed spectrum of the gas plume around 31 atlas shows prominent nickel emission, but no evidence for iron other than 31 atlas. This anomaly was only known to exist in industrially produced nickel alloys through the carbonyl chemical pathway, which refines nickel through the formation and decomposition of nickel, tetra carbinol, tetra carbinol, the authors of the new paper postulate that this carbonyl process is realized naturally near the nucleus of 31 atlas. They argue that this in situ formation of this thing predicts that nickel should be strongly concentrated near the nucleus. So it's like the whole thing is some very weird metal. Right. That's the point. And it's, it's also there, there, it's weird the way it's moving. What are they saying about the way it's moving? There's something about self-correcting

Or something. I think that they thought it had some emission, I don't know, looked like a jet, but I

Don't think so. It seemed, no, it did seem like they were saying that it's changed. It's very far

Away. It's very far away. So yeah, they zoom in and so maybe it's the silence coming back. They're like, have the video. We have to go save our parents.

Seen you seen they got a telescope that actually took video of it.

That's what amazes me is that we have telescopes. I can see that far.

I can send it to you, Jamie. This guy has it on his Twitter page. I, but it's like, it's very low resolution obviously. 'cause it's fucking millions of miles away. But whatever it is is really weird. It's really weird.

I, you know, people ask me all the time if, if I believe in aliens. I think just because of what I do for a living and the genre that I'm in and, and you know,

I can't wait to talk to you about

Aliens. What I always say, you are gonna be vastly disappointed that I know so little about them. But what I always say is, I think it's a line from a movie where it would be an awful waste of space if it was just us.

Yeah. That is a line in the movie. I don't remember what movie

It was. It's from the movie with Jodi Foster contact Contact. Oh. When her dad says to her that it would be an awful waste of space. Yeah. Beautiful movie.

It's a great movie. Carl Sagan wrote that book. That's it. So this is the thing. Like what is that? What the fuck is this? Like, obviously low resolution obviously moving through space, but also, what the hell is that?

Well, it seems to be moving pretty quickly. Yeah. Yeah.

It looks like a spaceship.

I mean it also looks like a dust bunny.

I was showing my friend Matt last night, we were having dinner and I was showing him videos of praying mantis killing hummingbirds. 'cause he didn't believe it. Stop. He's

Like, no way. Well, they're big praying mantis can be quite big. Right.

Not in comparison to hummingbirds. It's crazy how strong they are. Like, stop.

They literally kill

Hummingbirds. They just snatch hummingbirds right off feeders. So they sit, sit by the hummingbird feeder motionless and the hummingbird comes in to take a drink and just snatches them. What

Do they do with them? Eat them.

Stop.

It's

Crazy. Praying Mantis are so

It makes me really sad.

Ruthless. I have watched.

Well they eat their own young, right?

They probably do. I mean, I don't know. Yeah. I don't know if they do that, but I know that they, like, they put a praying mantis in, in a box and then they'll drop a roach in and the praying mantis just, just snatches it up and just starts to eating the roach alive.

Yeah. But that doesn't make roach me feel

Bad. Roach. But it does it to this

Bird that makes me feel bad.

But the thing is like, why couldn't that be an intelligent life form in front of another planet? Like, and then come, come here on 31 atlas and land. I mean that is a, that's, that is a possibility. Well

That's the thing, right? Is that we spend so much time, or I guess in our imagination, like we've been conditioned to think that, you know, intelligent life looks like something Yeah. From these movies. So we all think intelligent life is, you know, these guys with big heads or they look like us or you know, whatever we think. But they absolutely could literally be a flea. It

Could be a six foot tall mantis.

It could be. Yeah.

Yeah. And then we'd be in real trouble. Real trouble.

It's like, you know.

Absolutely. Show, show her one of those Praying mantis is getting a, a hummingbird. This

Is gonna make me really sad, you guys.

I mean, it makes me sad too. I love hummingbirds. Does it? Yes.

I love that. Have you ever wanted to wear one of those hats with the hummingbird feeders on it?

You know, do people do that? That's so crazy.

Like, they'll put the little things and they can just stay really silk.

They're a beautiful little bird. A weird, they're gorgeous, weird little bird too. And the way they're able to change direction and move,

It's amazing. I didn't realize I, our house where we live now, they stop all the time. So like, they'll sit on the branches and stuff, which is really rare. Rare to see.

So this is praying mantis are so nasty. But look at

It, it kind knows It's there. Just sit.

Well that one, that one. Oh

My God. He grabbed us by his beach.

Oh yeah. Reached out and just snagged him. The thing is, they're so strong for their size. I mean, that's, that is literally like a person tried to take out a cow

Go down. There was one that one the with the praying Manus in the,

The scorpion. Oh. Praying Manti is gonna kill that scorpion. That scorpion doesn't have a fucking chance. I don't know if he, that's what I'm guessing. I don't. Yeah. Look, he's already on top of him. What? Yeah, he just mounted him. But then

Look, he's avoiding the

Yeah, he is gonna figure it out.

He's also avoiding the stinger. Like, what is happening?

I what is happening? They're probably both trying to figure out why they're in there together.

Oh my God. Like this is the shit of nightmares for

Me. Praying mantis are not, they're monsters. They're, see if you can find videos of praying mantis eating roaches. There's like a whole mantis page on Instagram where they put like a different bug in there with praying mantis

And happens. How do we know it's not AI created though, guys?

Because this has been around for years. Yeah, yeah. Praying mantis is, oh look, they, they fuck up giant lizards. They kill lizards like the lizard. Oh my God. Tried to eat him at the beginning of it. Oh my God. I If you watch the video, the actual video, the li the lizard tried to eat him. He is like, not today, bitch, I'll be eating you. Oh my God. That poor lizard thought he was going to eat the praying mantis. And the praying mantis is eating him. Like, we are so lucky that they're little. We're so lucky.

We are so lucky. I hate

'cause if they were big and smart.

No. And then there's a bird. I don't wanna see the bird

Guy. Is you killing that bird? Oh my

God.

One I found, which I hadn't seen before. It's, it's hanging upside down from a flower eating right here,

Eating the bird. Oh my God. It's like,

It's a, it's a big bird too. That is

Wild.

My god.

They're just monsters. I mean, that's like alien from the movie Alien. That's what it's like. Oh my God. It's just little,

The my entire mind has been blown. Right.

Look at that. That's what a praying mantis can do. Hang upside down while it's eating a bird

And literally hanging onto the petals of a flower.

Like it's nothing

Upside down.

And with no strain at all. It's not none

Whatsoever.

It's carrying a fucking bird that's like five times bigger

Than a body. Like the size is like a barn swallow. It's

Crazy.

Oh my God.

This is the crazy thing is these stupid lizards that think they're gonna eat 'em.

Oh my God.

I mean, it is such a bizarre

Creature. I don't wanna see any of this part. Look at that one, that one that pour the

Beauty part. Oh, they do it all the time. They get hummingbirds. So he is just Oh,

A lot of these have no action though, too. I've seen, oh

My god. People trying

To capture stuff. But these go back as long as YouTube does. Some of those are 15-year-old videos.

That's,

It's so those are the ones I would try. Oh. But they get 'em so quickly. Why do they stop moving so quickly?

They're so fast.

Because they're so strong to this one

Looks that one looks fake.

Ai, I mean fake. Now it's created within four weeks. I start going, all right,

That's, oh, that looks, that looks like ai. Ai. That's ai. But the other ones are, those cell phone ones are real.",,,"Katee Sackhoff is an actor known for such roles as Kara ""Starbuck"" Thrace on ""Battlestar Galactica,"" Bo-Katan Kryze on ""The Mandalorian,"" and Vic Moretti on ""Longmire.""

"e people have just a different thing. And always, in my mind, my number one goal is to try to make the, get the most outta them. Like get them to like have the most fun, the most. Yeah. Get the questions that stir their interest the most. Like something, I wanna know who you are. Yeah. Like for real, for real. Yeah. Like I want to like help you be the best version of you that you can when you're doing it. Yeah.

You know, that's sort of my thing as well. Like I wanted to, you know, one of the things that came outta COVID for me was that, and I don't know about you, but I had weekly conversations with girlfriends I hadn't talked to in years. And we would, like, every Tuesday at four o'clock, we'd have a drink and connect again. And the conversations were wonderful because we had the time to have them again and Right. And then I started going back to conventions and in the Green room I was having these wonderful conversations with people and I was like, God, I wish I could record these. Because they're really authentic and you're getting to see people in a very different light and they're really opening up because it's not like a Gotcha podcast. Like, you know, if you wanna cut something out, you can cut something out. Like, I'm not here to like ruin your career, you know? Right, right. And the conversations are really interesting and people are talking about things that they've never spoken about. And it's just really fun. So I've really enjoyed it.

Well don't you think like you are learning in the process as well? Isn't that like one of the more fun parts of it? Mm, absolutely. The more you get to talk to interesting people, the more you learn, the more You understand how other people think and how they feel about stuff.

Yeah. And it inspires the shit outta me. Yeah, me too. You know, like if I have like a month where I'm not hustling and someone comes on the podcast and they're like, I got six things in production. I'm doing this. I wrote an album, I got a book coming out, man, I got six kids. I'm like, fuck.

Like there's

A balance. I have work

Harder to be had though, isn't there?

Oh, of course there is. Of course there is. And I think that I've found that the right balance. I have the right partner that's like super supportive and we're a real good team. And, and yeah, it's just, it's, I've got, I think I've got the right balance, but there's always gonna be hust in me. That's just, of

Course you seem like you're well balanced though. That's, it's a good thing to see.

Train by Day. Joe Rogan podcast by night all day.

Okay,

Gentlemen, good to see you,

Brother. Hey, good to see you again. How

You been?

You good? I've ve been hanging, man. How about yourself?

I'm good. I'm good. And Jeff, nice to meet you as well. Nice to meet you, Joe. This is another one of your very unusual friendships, Darryl.

I'm trying to make it the norm. You understand?

Well, I mean, you're, you're a real example of what can be done, but just by being a nice person. Hey,

Thank you, man, for, for the mention with Bono.

Oh, my pleasure, my pleasure. So for people who don't know, Darrell has, I mean, how many people now have you converted?

I, I, I stopped counting after 200 and some

Darrell, his journey initially started your musician, you met a Klansman at a bar, and he couldn't believe what a nice guy you were. You struck up a friendship with

This guy and I played like Jerry Lee Lewis, and he didn't understand that,

That too, the talent. And then this guy quit the Klan because of you and handed you his outfit and said like, I'm done. Yeah. Obviously I'm wrong. All this is wrong. And you then went on to start meeting a lot of other clan members and a lot of other, you know, different neo-Nazi factions, and you got a lot of these people to quit these hateful organizations. Well,

I got them to, to rethink because I gave them things, perspectives they had not considered before or not been exposed to. And that caused them to quit. You know, it wasn't like I, I wasn't trying to get them out, I was just trying to show them a different path.

Right. But it's just your patience and your ability to communicate to people is just very admirable, because that's a very tough path. You know, you, for people just listening, you're a black man, you're meeting a Klansman and you strike up a friendship. You know, you wind up having dinner at his house, hanging out with him. He is like, you're actually a really nice guy. It's like, fuck, what the fuck am I doing with my life? And just by your own personality and just being a, a good human, you, you converted them.

But, you know, an interesting component to that also happens. 'cause you know, there are people who won't talk to me, you know, and they wanna fight me and stuff and all the kind of crazy stuff. I've seen it all. Right. But some of their buddies who are just as hateful as they are, you know, when they talk to me and they end up leaving their life improves. Hate is exhausting. Right. You know? And it hate begets more hate. Yeah. But so when they leave, their life improves. And then the buddy who want to fight me or, or didn't want to talk to me, he sees his buddy's life improve, then he reconsiders. Yeah. So it has has that component to it as well.

And so it's been more than 200 now, which is really amazing. And you've all, I think just these conversations that you've had with a lot of people sort of opened up a lot of people's eyes as well. It's like, you know, you think of someone like, that's a KKK member, neo-Nazi, or whatever it is. And you go, well, that guy's gotta be a piece of shit as a human being. And then you realize like, well, a lot of these people just got fucked over in life and started off on the wrong foot, and were with the wrong people and got indoctrinated to the wrong ideology and experienced the wrong things. And next thing you know, they have this rigid idea of what the world is and how they fit in. And it's all fucked up and it's all wrong. And they just don't run into anyone that shows them a different perspective. Like, if you're in a small town and you're around just a bunch of assholes all the time, you're around the same assholes. Like you might think everyone's an asshole, right? Sure. And then you go on vacation to, you know, maybe in your whole, in Hawaii, like, God, everybody's nice here. What's going on? Maybe I have a totally different view of the world. Well, you could have that with everything. You could have that with geographical locations, you could have that with racial disparities, you could have that with everything.

Well, I mean, you know, let's, let's, let's take racism outta the picture for a second. Let's, let's look at our own country, you know, as a musician, right? I do a lot. I've, I've paid in all 50 states. Okay. You know, and when I sign, you know, go to, I have a booking and say, let's say New York City, you know, everything's gotta, you know, gotta be on paper, gotta sign this contract. And they want things like yesterday, you know, it's very fast paced, et cetera. So, you know, you sign a contract and people adhere to it. Whatever. My experience in the south, you know, say Mississippi, Georgia, something like that. They don't care about contracts. Even though I, I get one, you know, a handshake is good enough. You know, they, they, they feel that their word is their bond. Right. So, you know, you, you present them with a contract. It's like, what? You don't trust me. You know, that kind of thing.

Right, right,

Right. And in the Midwest, which is where I'm from originally, you know, it takes a while for people to get to know you. They want, they want to get to know you before they commit. They're very close to the vest out in California. It's like, I'll get around to it maybe next week, maybe the week after. Right. You know? Right.

Right. Now, Jeff, how did you guys meet?

So I was contacted by a filmmaker and they said, would you come down and, and film as part of this program? So I didn't know I was meeting Daryl Davis and the movement, we knew who Daryl Davis was, 'cause he was pulling people out of this

Movement. Explain the movement, the what movement You were a part of.

I was a part of the National Socialist Movement. I was,

Which is Nazis. Nazis for people that don't, it sounds like socialists. Like, oh, college campuses. You know, you want Marxism free healthcare for all. No

Different kind of socialism. Yeah, yeah. neo-Nazis. Yeah. So,

And how did you get indoctrinated into that? So

I was a part of that movement for 27 years.

Wow. 25. How old are you? How old are you?

So I'm 51.

Okay. You look young. I thought you were about 40. I was like, what the fuck? Well,

That's okay.

No, you look good.

Thank you.

Which is crazy for a Nazi. I think it's a lot of stress. You'd

Think it is a lot of stress Hate. Lot of stress hair. Yeah. Look, I lost on my hair. Well, I lost mine

Too. And I'm

Not a Nazi.

So how old were you when you got into it? When

I first started, the fascination with it was about fourth grade. Fourth

Grade.

Fourth grade.

How

My grandfather fought in Hitler's army during the war. And my great uncles did as well. So my mother and grandparents came over after the war.

Wait a minute. Fought in Hitler's army, correct? Oh, they fought for the Nazis? Yes. Wow.

Yes. So I'm, my mother and grandparents came over after the war, but So you one would think so he was indoctrinated by his family. Not, not the truth, quite opposite actually. But I was fascinated. I knew that history and I knew that my grandfather had fought and I looked up to him. So I sought out on that journey myself, you know? And got,

But what attracted you to that? Like, first of all, you, you said you haven't made in Detroit church. Are you from Detroit? Yes.

Okay. Well, well, I'm based in Detroit now.

So were you living in Detroit at the time? Yes. So why, what made you fascinated with Nazis living in Detroit?

Well, I grew up in rural Minnesota. Okay. And I live in Detroit now, is what I meant. But knowing that family history, I had just looked up to my grandfather and I thought, you know this, he's a strong individual. This is a, I'm just gonna say it like, I thought it was cool at the time. There's nothing cool about it. But I wasn't taught to hate. I wasn't raised to hate. And so I seek out this movement. I join as a teenager, quickly rise up through the ranks. Within a couple of years. I was appointed a national leader of that organization. And then I was there for 27 years. So, geez, I was taught racism and hate and to be an antisemite. Now, when

You were in the fourth grade, what were you, what were you, do you remember what your feelings were about people?

I, I wasn't a racist at that point or, or anything like that. It was just thinking that it was cool seeing the videos of, I remember watching Old World War II documentaries thinking, I'm gonna find my grandfather in these, these footages, you know, and I just looked up to him and I sought out that path. And once you're indoctrinated, once you join and you're, you're overwhelmed with this kind of ideology, it becomes your whole world. It's your echo chamber, everything about it. Everything that you're involved in circles around that world.

And so, like, when you're in the fourth grade and you get interested in this, how do you eventually like, join up and meet the Nazis? Like how does that happen?

Well, at that age, you're not, you know, you're not meeting the Nazis or anything like that today. Kids are online and they're, and

They are. Wow. Yeah. That's a good point. Yeah.

Right. But at that point, I wasn't, so I was searching it out and by the time I was 18, then I'm joining. Yeah.

You didn't have Kanye songs back then,

Right?

That song is so crazy. Like, somebody needs to pull Kanye saw to give him a hug. Yeah. That song's crazy. So you, what was the first organization that you like officially became a part of? And what, what did they do?

So the National Socialist Movement was the group that I sought

You find them, first of all, because this was all before the internet. Right?

Right. This was a really kind of strange story. So I'm looking for books. I'm trying to read everything I can on, and I'm trying to find these

Books. Did you have other hobbies or just being a Nazi? No, I had, I, I had other baseball or anything like that.

I was a longhaired rock and roll singer.

No fucking way. Right? You are a rock and roll Nazi. That's nuts. Right? That seems like, so that's like jumbo shrimp, right? That's so counterintuitive. How are you a rock and roll Nazi? That's rock and roll's all about like freedom and creativity and expression. I,

I know there's a lot of counterintuitive stuff in my life. Wow. Yeah. Sadly.

Well, that just shows you people are really complicated.

Yeah.

You know? So when you first found these people, so you're a rock and roll musician, and how do you, how do you find them?

So I found them in a book at the library. I'm ordering all these books. And it was written by a sociologist or something, and they had all these addresses of everybody that participated in the book in the back of the book. So I'm writing, physically writing, not like emailing today, but like writing all these organizations. And then I eventually, how

Old were you at the time? Like

18. So

You're 18 and you're writing Nazi groups saying, Hey, I'm ready. Sign me up. Yep.

Wow.

Okay. So who responds?

So everybody per, some of the groups were closed down at that point. But most of the groups responded. And I'm looking through all the literature and, and I meet up with the National Socialist Movement. At the time it was called National Socialist American Workers Freedom Movement. Again, this is the Nazis.

That's a lot of words.

That's what I thought. Yeah. So

American Workers Freedom Movement. Yeah.

It's a

Lot of,

A lot of,

And freedom for some people, you

Know? Yeah. Another counterintuitive thing there.

Socialist for some people. Some people,

Right? Not that socialism, not leftwing, but Yeah.

Weird socialism. Yeah. So like, what were they involved in? Like, so when you meet them, do you have to have like a, is there a vetting process? They make sure you're not a fed or sit you down and, you know, what are you looking for? Why are you involved? Why are you interested?

Yeah. And back, back then, the group was pretty small, but the reason that I picked that organization big, I mean, it was only in a handful of states at the time I joined. It was pretty small. It was a, it was a, the National Socialist Movement was a continuation of the movement of George Lincoln Rockwell, who was the original founder of the American Nazi Party. So that's why I wanted to join that particular organization because it had that history. 'cause I was a fan of history. I always wanted to be as close to the German movement as possible. So that was, that was the group that I sought out. And then there, there is like a vetting process. You know, they want to know you sign up an application. And later on in, in the group, I was doing things like having people sign non-disclosure agreements and doing background checks on people. Mm. And things of that nature.

I wanna point this out because this is a really crazy fact. It's gonna blow a lot of people's minds. Before World War ii, there was a Nazi rally in Madison Square Garden. Yeah.

American Bun. The German American bun. Yep.

It is nuts when you see it in Madison Square Garden and you see, you know, the swastika, the whole deal. And you're like, this is before anybody had connected this with evil. Right? Like, back then, that was an ancient Hindu symbol. Like there's a Hindu temple near my old house in California, and it has swastikas all over it. And they, because of the, the temple's from the 18 hundreds and they have to tell people, Hey, like this is a sign. Hey, it's not that kind of swastika. Right.

Back in 2018. Yeah. The State Department sent me over to India to speak and lecture. And you see these, these, these symbols all over the place. Yeah. Yes. 'cause it's a, it's a peace, good luck

"nance. Yeah. And that, and so when the first person left, I, I thought, you know, this person, this is a fluke. You know, this guy was probably wasn't, you know, invested in it fully. But then it happened again and again and again. And I thought, okay, well now something I must be doing when I'm interviewing these people is back when I was writing my first book, what am I doing? And I narrowed it down to about five core values that everybody wants between traveling with my parents as a child in the, you know, US State Department, foreign services, diplomats, and now traveling as an adult musician and lecturer. I, I told you before, I've been to all 50 states. I've been to 64 countries on six continents. And I can tell you this, no matter how far I've gone from our country, right next door to Canada, right next to, to Mexico, or halfway around the globe, no matter who I meet, maybe around the world, they don't look like me or speak my language or worship as I do, or not worship at all. I've always concluded that every person I've met is a human being. And as such, every human being wants these five core values in their lives. Everyone wants to be loved. We all want to be respected. We want to be heard. We wanna be treated fairly and truthfully. And we want the same things for our family as anybody else would want for their family. And if we can learn to apply those five core values, or any of those five values, when we find ourselves in an adversarial situation, or in a culture or society in which we're unfamiliar or uncomfortable, I'll guarantee you that your navigation of that society, that culture, that situation will be much more smooth, much more positive and much more productive. And so that's what was happening, because these people have been interviewed before, but they didn't leave. So that, you know, is how you talk to people. Mm. Not more so than what you say to people. Right. And how you listen to them. You know, and when I say respect, it doesn't mean that I respect what they're saying. I'm respecting their right to say it. Right. Right. And so I think, you know, that's been one of the key things that worked with, with Jeff and worked with other people. And when it started happening more and more, I realized I stumbled onto something and I needed to keep doing this. And that's why I'm still doing it today. And Jeff and I go out, you know, oftentimes, you know, we just came back from Indianapolis a few weeks ago. We were in Orlando speaking to the, to the Holocaust Center there. And wherever else.

When you look back on your life and you think about the enormous amount of time that you spent in the movement and now being essentially of a completely different mindset. Like what does that feel like for you when you look back on yourself?

It's, it's like two different people. So like, a lot of times when I'll speak about that life, I'll say, that was my past life. You know, I know it's not my past life. It's still the same life. But it, it is like looking back at a different person. Like when I started doing work with the Weisenthal Center, one of the things was after, after talks, a lot of people in the Jewish community were like, I don't get it. I don't, you're such a nice guy. I don't get it. It doesn't make sense. Right. So we started showing video clips of my speeches and things that I did when I was in the movement ahead of those things. And I was always, and, and then people were like, oh, now I get it. You know? 'cause they, they could see it. They could see how different that was and how, how different the person is. Not the person. Nice guy that they met. But that's who I was. So, and I, and I always try to get outta showing those clips. I'm like, could I be backstage or somewhere else? 'cause I don't wanna look at it like I, right. It's, it's hard to, I mean, I can look at it, Obviously, I do it all the time. But it's tough. It's tough because it's like, man,

Does it feel shame,

Shame, guilt. You just feel terrible about it. So I think that drives the work. A lot of the work that I'm doing now and, and is, is to help others and to repair some of that damage that's been done. Well,

I think your perspective is very important for people to understand that, you know, someone can shift their mindset. And that just because someone has a hateful, evil ideology they've attached themselves to, doesn't mean they're a hateful, evil person. Inherently, it's learned behavior and learned thinking. And this is the problem with human beings, is we're incredibly malleable. You know, human beings are, we follow the leader and we adopt ideologies. And we are also very tribal. So you become a part of a group, whether you call it a family or a team or whatever, you hate the other people. 'cause they're, they're the enemy now. Now it's us against them. And we're all in this together. And that unites everybody. That's a part of the movement. And it makes you feel like you're a part of something bigger. Yep. Yeah. It's a trap. It's a terrible trap. And it's a trap that human beings can easily fall into. And you see it with political ideologies. You see it with religion, you see with everything. I mean, people just, we, we are very tribal. And that can manifest itself in some very disgusting thinking.

I want to add something to that. I think you're a hundred percent right for the most part. But the tribal thing never, never came into, into, into play with me. And nor did it come into play with other people who were raised the way I did. I was, I first started traveling abroad overseas at the age of three in 1961. I was born in 58, so I'm 67 now. And my first introduction to school was abroad. The State Department assigns you to the American Embassy in some foreign country for two years. And then you come back home at the end of the two years, you're here for a few months, maybe a year, and then you're back over to another foreign country for two years. Back and forth, back and forth. My dad's job as a US diplomat was to foster better relations between a foreign country and our US government. Right. So, which is why, you know, we're overseas. So my first intro introduction to school was abroad. I did kindergarten, first grade, third grade, fifth grade, seventh grade, all in different schools in different countries. The in between grades I would do back home here. Right. My, my classmates abroad, now we're talking about the 1960s. My classmates abroad were from all over the world because anybody who had an embassy stationed where we had our American embassy, all of their kids went to the same school. So this little girl sitting at this little desk here might've been from Czechoslovakia, that kid from Nigeria, that kid's from Italy, that kid from Japan. You know, if you open the door to my classroom and look in, you would say, oh, you know, this is a United nations of little children. That's exactly what it was. That became my baseline for what school was supposed to be. But every time I'd come home, I would either be in all black schools or black and white schools, meaning the still segregated or the newly integrated. And just because desegregation was passed four years before I was born in 1954 by the Supreme Court, schools did not integrate overnight. It took years and years. And even in some places today, in 2025, this country is still struggling with integration. Right. So that became my norm. You know, this multicultural thing. I didn't know tribes, everybody was part of my tribe. And that's why I didn't understand racism. Because, you know, now if I, if I had grown up here my whole life and, and my first experience with somebody who did not look like me was having bottles and rocks thrown at me at the age of 10, and in a parade, maybe I wouldn't be doing this work today, maybe I would be, whoa, I'm, I'm gonna stay away from those, those ki from those color of people. Right. You know, that kind of thing. So I didn't know tribalization simply because of my, my growing up experience. Very

Unique experience.

E exactly. Yeah. And most Americans didn't have that. Now today, you know, and back then, you know, you buy your kids, you're talking about 1960s, you buy your kids' dolls. I had GI Joe dolls. Right. You know, I, I don't have any siblings, but you know, my friends, you know, they have Barbie dolls and back then all the GI Joes were white. All the Barbie dolls were white. So black kids had to play with little white dolls. You know, there was nothing that looked like them. Mm. Today you have, you know, all kinds of color of dolls and, and nationalities and ethnicities, which broadens the scope of these children. So when they see the real deal walking down the street, you know, well, that's my favorite doll. So, you know, I'm okay with that person. Rather than, you know, you, you reinforce that tribalism by buying your kids the dolls that look like you and your parents. Mm.

Yeah. Well, that makes sense. And it also sets you up to be uniquely qualified to do what you do. You know, like as a person who did grow up around so many different people.

So I try to share that, I guess, you know, vicariously Yeah. With people.

Jeff, did you grow up around, I mean, other than when you moved to Detroit, were you around mostly white people? Like?

Yeah, so growing, where I grew up is like in the middle of the cornfield, basically. I grew up in a little town. It was barely a thousand people, all white. Basically. The only interactions you had with other races was typically in the summertime, like when farm workers would come up from Mexico and, and things like that. And a lot of times people just didn't talk to them. So I didn't really have in any, hardly any interactions with people of other races.

So where did the negative ideas about other races come from?

The movement came from the

Movement. All from the movement. Not from personal experience at

All. Nope. Nope. I did not have bad personal experiences. In fact, even to this day, most of the bad personal experience I had with other people. I mean, I've had pe assassination attempts, I've got scars from attacks all white people.

And this is assassination. Isn't that ironic? Is this post leaving or, during, during, during, during. Why are they trying to kill you?

Well, Antifa tried to, tried to get me to scar across the back of my head was from tire iron.

Where, what happened there,

It was, they infiltrated the organization. And we had went to a, and this is in my book, American Nazi by the way. But we had went to a Rochester, Minnesota and to pass out leaflets. And it was myself and my roommate, and then two other guys that had infiltrated. And at the end of the night, make a long story short, I'm reaching into the trunk of a car. And as I'm reaching down into the trunk of the car to pick up this box of merchandise from the, from the record label, the guy pulls out a tire iron and smashes me across the back of the head and says, we're here to kill you. Whoa. And it felt like the whole, like being scalped, the whole back of my head was, scalp was hanging down, and I just, I wouldn't get knocked out. I would've been killed if I would've been knocked out. I just remember stumbling and putting my hand across the back of my head, and it felt like a wet sponge and just kind of staggering. And my roommate blocked another hit. 'cause the guy tried to hit me again. 'cause I didn't go down. And by that time, I'm just kind of, you know, stunned, staggering, concussion, whatever you wanna call it. And started stumbling into traffic in the middle of the street. And then, you know, he had gotten away from the guy and pulled me o off to the other side of the street. And yeah, that was, that was one incident.

So there's multiple times people tried to kill

You. Yeah, I've been shot at, yeah. And this is all, I've had a stabbing. People tried to stab me too. Yeah. This is also

While you were in the movement. Oh,

Yeah.

And who was shooting at you

Gangs. Yeah.

So people that had just found out that you guys were Nazis and they just tried to shoot

You? Well, we were, I mean, we were wearing the symbols everywhere. Like, I mean, flight jackets with swastika patches and stuff like that. So, I mean, that was gonna be a, that was pretty volatile, especially in different neighborhoods.

When you talk to other people that have left the movement, do they have, like, is there a pivotal moment in a lot of these people's lives where they realized that this was the wrong path? Is it a accumulation of other people's experiences that they're, they take into consideration? Like, what, what is it, is there a main factor?

It, it really is different for everybody, but usually it doesn't happen like a snap of a finger. You know, like I could, you know, like we were talking about, hundreds of people have left a movement. I can think of just like, on one hand, the people that have left over, like one act of kindness or one, one simple thing. Very few people do that. It's usually a process. So they're going through this shift in thinking kind of like I was, and they're, they're questioning it. They're questioning like, well, what it's, there's a lot of cognitive dissidence. There's a lot of confirmation bias that takes place. And they're having experiences sometimes with people of other races that helps, you know, where it doesn't fit the narrative of the movement, what's being spewed. So they're, they're fighting with this in their head for a long time. For different people, it's different things. It's sometimes it's just seeing the humanity in the people that you once dehumanized.

Darryl, this is such a heavy path you're on. Does it, I, I know it must feel very rewarding, but interacting with so many people that have been indoctrinated into hate, does it sometimes feel overwhelming?

No. It, it doesn't. I mean, I've had some disappointments, you know, people, not everybody's gonna change. Right. You know, on, on either side. Black, white, you know, have you had

People that were close that were close to shifting and they fall back

In their own ways? Yeah. It's, it's like alcoholics who fall off the wagon. Right, right. You know, that kind of thing. But I've had some who I never thought would change. I mean, there'll be people who would on, on all sides, who will go to their graves being hateful, violent, racist, whatever, antisemitic. But even some of those I've had come back and change, but I know not, not all would do it. Some are just die hard, you know? Yeah. They're not gonna change for anything. And so I don't give up on those people, but I move them down my list of priorities and deal with the ones who are open to talking. I mean, even though they're just as hateful and violent and, and racist or whatever, as, you know, if they will talk, there's an opportunity to plant a seed. The seed's not gonna bloom overnight, you know? So when it happens, great. You know, then I move my way down to the ones who are, who, you know, didn't want to talk to me or, or we got into some kind of scuffle or whatever, things like that. But as I was telling you before, when, when their buddies change and they see that life improve, Hmm. Sometimes it's, it's a wake up call for them. Because, you know, initially they think there's nothing this black guy can do that's gonna help them. Who the hell is he to think he'd even think, you know, I'm the superior one, he's the inferior one. But when they compare their life to their, to their buddy's life, and now he's superior, he's, he's living superiorly and getting along fine. You know, I want that. Right. So now they come around and for

Some people it's, it's, it's a, something staggering, you know, like I can think of, I'm just thinking of a couple of the cases that I've worked on, and like one guy, his son committed suicide, and he had brought his whole family into the movement. And he felt like it was the ideology that did that.",,,"Daryl Davis is a blues musician, race relations expert, and author of several books, including ""The Klan Whisperer.""

"le and his right hand guy, they're the heads of the American Nazi party. Now, after Rockwell came to my school, to my class, and they spoke to my class. Now, you could never do this, do that today, you know, but I'm glad we were able to do that back in 1974. You know, I, I, I wish that kind of thing would happen today so people can see what's, you know, freedom of speech and all that. Matt Cole pointed at me and pointed at another black kid in my class and said, we're gonna ship you back to Africa. And then he went like this. And all you Jews out there, you're going back to Israel. Now, I'm 15 years old. I just sat there like looking at the guy, like, what, what on earth, you know, is this man talking about, I, I didn't say anything to him, but one of my classmates was a girl piped up and said, well, they live here. You know, what if they don't want to go? And Mack Cole said, oh, they have no choice. If they do not leave voluntarily, they will be exterminated in the upcoming race war. That was the first time I ever heard the term race war. Now, I was already fascinated by racism since I was 10 years old, right? But race war, what is this man talking about? Right? And so I began buying books and all kinds of stuff, learning different terminology for it, which will come later. Like for example, the white supremacists, they have two terms for the race war. One is Raho, R-A-H-O-W-A Raho, which are the first two letters of three words. Racial, holy War. Also, they all, they call it the Boogaloo. So if you hear that term, then they're talking about the 1960s, you know, dance music. So we talking about the race war. And so the Matt Cole talked about the race war. Well, I graduated two years later, 1976 from high school. I graduated from college in 1984 years after that. And like I said, racism became my obsession. I did not confront Matt Cole in school because, you know, my peer group back then, you know, we were raised, you have respect for your elders as figures of authority. Whether you accept them or not, you still respect them. And so, you know, I didn't confront him like that. But now I've graduated from college, right? And I graduated 1980 at eight. At age 22. In 1982, I'm age 24. I developed contacts with different people. I knew where some of these groups were, et cetera. I found out about a demonstration, an unpublicized demonstration by the American Nazi party that was gonna take place in front of the White House. There is a park right across the street from the White House called Lafayette Park, 24 7, 365 days a year, there is somebody in that park protesting something, nuclear weapons, the environment, abortion, you name it. They're there all the time. And they face the White House with their billboards and whatever. So I found out the American Nazi party was gonna have a silent unpublicized demonstration, which means nobody knows about it, not even the police, right? So I'm gonna go down there and see them. Now, back then, you could drive up and down the 1600 block of Pennsylvania Avenue, which is where the White House sits. And I only lived like, you know, about 30, 40 minutes from there, you know, 15 minutes from DC on a non rush hour day. So I, I go down there early, they're gonna be there at 12 noon. I park my car, a catty corner to the White House. I wait, here comes this van, about 13 to 15 of these Nazis get out, right? And who do I see? Matt Cole and Martin Kerr, the same two guys from eight years ago who came to my school. You never forget the face. I mean, I can look at my hand right now and see his face right there. Mm. You know, you never forget the face of somebody who tells you they're gonna ship you somewhere, right? Hey, whether you want to go or not. And if you don't go volunt or exterminate you exterminate you if you don't go voluntarily, right? So anyway, Matt Cole gets all his Nazis lined up. They're not wearing anything that indicates they're Nazis. They're wearing just dark black suits. And they're standing there like this, facing the White House across the street like this. People are, it's lunchtime in DC people are walking by, not even known who they are. I know who they are, right? I guess maybe the White House might've known who they were. So anyway, once he got 'em all lined up, I walked right over to Matt Cole and I said, Matt Cole, he like jumped, like, who was this black person calling my name? You know? And he says, do I know you? And I said, well, you spoke at my high school and what high school would that be? I said, Wooten High School in Rockville, Maryland. And he goes, yes, yes, yes, I remember you. That was a long time ago. And I said, yes. He remembered you. Yeah, he remembered me. Yeah. Wow. And he, and he said, yes, that was a long time ago. I, I said, yes, that was eight years ago. He goes, yes, yes. I remember. What can I do for you? I said, well, I'm still here. He says, I can see that. How can I help you? I said, well, you can, you can tell me just who the hell gives you the authority to make permanent travel arrangements for me? And he says, what's your name? I said, Daryl Davis. And then he did something I've never forgotten. He shook my hand and he held my hand real tight. And he shook his f with his other hand, shook his finger in my face. And he said, Mr. Davis, you have to understand one thing. It was in the interest of your race, the black race to be a strong race. And you cannot be a strong race unless you are a pure race. And you cannot be a pure race if you are miscegenation with other races. It was in the interest of my race, the Aryan race, which is what he calls white race, right? To also be a pure race. And we cannot be a, to be a strong race. And we cannot be a strong race if we are miscegenation with gro. I mean, with our mud races such as yours, we are becoming a mongrel race. So anybody who's non-white is a mud race. And he's, he's fearing that his race is, is, is dying out, becoming a mongrel race by mixing with other races. So he says, until the races understand that they cannot urate, we cannot live side by side. We cannot live together.

And what do you hear there? Fear. Yeah. Yeah, fear.

So he, you know, I talked to him for about, you know, maybe 20, 30 minutes. I wasn't there to beat him up or cuss him out, right? I just want to understand where he is coming from, right? And so, a few months later, they applied for a permit. They had their National American Nazi party recruitment rally in Washington DC So people came from all over the country, right? And now, this time it was publicized. So you had, you know, you had about 50 of them show up and there were tens of thousands of people that came to protest from New York, Richmond, Virginia, Baltimore, all over. So you had every police department was there to, and there was rioting, all kinds of craziness going on, right? You could not get to, I went to there with my secretary. You could not get to the, to, to the Nazi. I saw Matt Cole in them. And now of course they're wearing their Gestapo uniforms with the ss insignias flying swastika flags and all that kind of thing. And you, but you couldn't get to them. 'cause if the police have their shields and their batons and pushing people back, right? So then people, they came with bricks and all kinds of stuff and began throwing them over the heads of the police to land on the Nazis gathered in this opening in the park. And so the cops began tear gassing everybody. And then it became a full blown riot. People were turning over police cars, breaking out the windows, kicking out the headlights setting buildings on fire in Washington DC You can, you can find it on, on YouTube. And so anyway, that this is before internet, right? 1980s, my secretary and I go home, we watch the news and there's Matt Cole sitting in the studio of one of the, the network TV stations in N-B-C-C-B-S-A-B-C, whatever it was. And he's talking to the anchor person and they're showing footage of the riot in DC that day. You see, you see it's the blacks in the Jews who are turning over the police cars and attack and trying to attack us. You don't see the Nazis turning over the police cars. It was then that I realized what he was doing because he, he was a pretty smart guy, just smart in the wrong direction. I couldn't figure out why would he have his national recruitment rally to, to recruit people into the Nazi party in Washington DC Washington DC is two thirds block. There are no black people in DC who want to join the American Nazi party. There are no Jews in Washington DC or Jews anywhere who want to join the, the American Nazi party. So why dc? Because he knew that would happen. And he has the official footage from CBSA, B-C-N-B-C. He takes that footage, goes out there to Coeur d'Alene, Iowa, Idaho, or Washington state, the Pacific Northwest, and says, you see what's going on in our nation's capitol, our country is being run by Zog. Zog is, is a, is a very common term in white supremacy. ZOG, it stands for Zionist occupied government. Oh boy. Yeah. And so he shows this, you know, rioting, you know, of all these people who he alleges are blacks and Jews destroying and, and denying people their right of freedom of assembly, freedom of speech. So then he, it, it's a recruitment tool. So I learned that and I, I, I realized what he was doing. And I've seen the Klan do the same thing. They will go somewhere where they know there's gonna be some kind of a riot. That's why they want to march in Skokie, Illinois, which was an all Jewish, you know, neighborhood. 'cause they knew it was gonna create a,

Wow. And they use that. But, so I learned a lot from Matt Cole.

Bizarre that someone would be smart in the wrong way like that. It's bizarre.

It's bizarre. But you find it in any color. Every color, you know, people, you know, divide and conquer is how you gain power.

And the first thing, and going back to the fear factor of that, like we did the exact same thing every time. There was violence, when we clash with Antifa or something like that, we had people out there filming, like NSM had its own media arm. So they're out there filming that, and we would put out those clips. So immediately, especially if there was violence, if there was actual clashes and the police weren't keeping people separated, those always turned into recruits. That's how these groups would, would utilize that stuff. So you'd have people that were being like, oh man, I, sorry, I missed it. I didn't know we'd be fighting with the reds. You know, like, I'll be at the next one. And then you'd have applications coming in from new recruits that would see it on the news. So with the, these groups were always manipulating the media. Some of the rallies that I organized were at places like Valley Forge, Yorktown, Virginia, historic places that you could use those, those elements. And it would guarantee the press or downtown LA at the, at the city hall or marching on DC places that would guarantee a lot of press. And just like Darryl said, it wasn't necessarily to recruit people in those areas, it was to whip up chaos because that would benefit these groups.

Well how did, how did these groups use the media or rather social media and the internet to radicalize people

Nowadays? It, it's a, it's a, it's a double-edged sword to media because these groups before, like, like I was discussing earlier, you had to like kind of search them out or, or a recruiter had to find you or something like that. It wasn't easy to find. Now a fourth grader can click on a website and go find these groups. They're, they're easy to find online. And so sometimes they're very overt, but a lot of times there's different censorship things that are in place. So they'll change the cover of the book. So the propaganda that we had in the, in the group, were making stuff look less than Oculus, not, you know, using swastikas or things like that. So some groups are very prolific at that. And they'll use podcasts, they'll use videos.

Do they have Nazi podcasts?

Oh yeah.

I would say like, don't

Get any ideas, man. They,

They don't get, they don't get as many as many listeners as Joe Rogan. But,

But I was, I was just saying thinking like, what, what kind of, how many people are listening to Nazi podcasts?

That really varies, you know? But

That's, is it, it's still a large movement in this country. Yeah,

Yeah.

And how does it grow now? Does it grow based on like, the things Darryl was talking about, like riots and stuff like that, where they'll use that maybe Black Lives Matter riots from the two thousands or, or 2020s rather. Well

Those, one of the things that's causing it to grow also, which I was gonna lead leading up to when I talked with Matt Cole, what I learned in 1982 was that these people, meaning the, the, the movement, the white supremacy movement are fearing, he told me this in 1982, they are fearing the year 2042. Alright? And it's not a conspiracy, it is for real. All right? The US census is taken every decade. I'm 67 when I was, it doesn't matter how old you are, how old he is or whatever. When we all were children, the black population in this country was 12% Native Americans, 1%, right? Latino, Hispanic Americans, almost 2% Asian Americans, Asia, a Pacific Islander, Americans, almost 3% whites were like around 86, 80 7%. It was back in, I was born in 58. Alright? So every decade this is happening, and this is what Matt Cole was telling me that they were fearing, he, he used the word fear. He said it has to be stopped. He said in the year 2042, if this trend continues, this country will be 50 50, meaning 50% white, 50% non-white. Alright. The last census taken in our country was 2020. Guess what? Whites went from like 80 some percent from the time I was a kid. And you were a kid now? 59%. That was in 2020. It's less than that right now in 2025. Mm. So in 20 40, 40, it's gonna be this, it's predicted between 2045 and 2050, it's gonna flip. And for the first time in the history of the United States, whites will become the minority. And while there are plenty of white people who say, Hey, that doesn't bother me, no big deal, evolution, what's, what's the big deal? Right?",,,"Daryl Davis is a blues musician, race relations expert, and author of several books, including ""The Klan Whisperer.""

"Latino, Hispanic Americans, almost 2% Asian Americans, Asia, a Pacific Islander, Americans, almost 3% whites were like around 86, 80 7%. It was back in, I was born in 58. Alright? So every decade this is happening, and this is what Matt Cole was telling me that they were fearing, he, he used the word fear. He said it has to be stopped.

So in 20 40, 40, it's gonna be this, it's predicted between 2045 and 2050, it's gonna flip. And for the first time in the history of the United States, whites will become the minority. And while there are plenty of white people who say, Hey, that doesn't bother me, no big deal, evolution, what's, what's the big deal? Right? There is a slice of our population, the ones that I deal with, who think it is a big deal and they're trying to stop it. And that's why when I first start, I've been doing that, like I, I said for 45 years, when I first started doing this, it, there was just the KKK, white power skinheads and some neo-Nazi groups. That was basically it, right? Today you got the K, k, K, the neo-Nazis, the skinheads, the Patriot front, the vanguard, the proud boys, the Oath keepers, the National Alliance, on and on and on. Whole slew of groups. And they're all saying, come join us. Come join us. We're gonna take back our country. Right? So people out of fear of their identity being erased as, as you know, they're saying, 'cause they're trying to keep the racists pure. 'cause what they tell me is, Darrell, I don't want my grandkids to be brown. They call it the Browning of America or white genocide through miscegenation. So these people out of fear of their identity being erased. 'cause they truly believe that they are patriots and it's their job to save this country. We built this country, we wrote the Constitution, and now people are coming into our country who don't look like us and squeezing us out of our own country. That's the mentality. And as Jeff points out, they're surrounded by an echo chamber that keeps repeating that. So then it becomes the truth to them, right? So they run and join these groups to, to take back the country. But when the group does not act fast enough to take back the country, they get antsy and get frustrated and say, you know what? If the Nazis can't do it, or the Klan can't do it, I'll do it myself. And they walk into a black church in South Carolina, boom, boom, boom, boom. And murder nine black people doing Bible study or the Tree of Life, synagogue in Pittsburgh kill off, you know, 11 Jewish people. The Buffalo Grocery Store in New York, the Sikh Indian Temple in Oak Creek, Wisconsin murders, seven Sikh Indians doing religious service. The Walmart in El Paso, Texas, 23 Mexican people were murdered by a white supremacist a few years ago. These, these, these people are called lone wolves. And every time one of them gets taken out by law enforcement or gets arrested and their property gets searched, law enforcement always finds a cache of automatic weapons that are being stockpiled for raho or the boogaloo because they, they're looking to have this, this re redo of the Civil War to, to preserve their lifestyle. And so 2042 is gonna be a pivotal year. And we're only what, 16, 17 years away from that right now.

Wow. So that's why they walked down the street chanting they will not replace us. That's what that's all about. Yep. Yeah. This is white replacement theory. Right.

Which, which is bogus. Nobody's trying to replace anybody. Just,

You guys aren't fucking enough. It's so simple. You're already the majority just, you need to do your work. It is

Just not my sister. Right.

Right. It's just such a disturbing aspect of society that you would think there's gonna come a point in time where there's enough education, enough understanding, and especially with the access to information we have with the internet, this would all go away. But it doesn't seem like that's helping, because it seems like the more access to information, the more people settle into these echo chambers

That, and also a lot of the old guard realize, you know, this is happening and if we want to preserve our, our culture, our whatever, we need to pass this on to young people. We need to get more young people involved. Right. And they began recruiting young people to, to disseminate this information. And, and, and, and, you know, galvanize Yeah. You know, more of their peers into, into this ideology. And, and back to, you know, the, the recruitment of, of military and, and, and law enforcement because they know this is gonna happen and they, and they want, they're gonna want those people on board to, to, to be on that side. And, you know, I mean, you, you can probably talk about military and, and law enforcement inside your organization. I can talk about it in the Klan or, you know, whatever.

Yeah. As far as like the military was concerned, we were actively trying to recruit military. So early on in the organization, it was like 10% maybe of the members. By the time I left, it was about 50%. That. And how

Did you do that?

Well, we, we, on their applications, you know, we were asking what branch they were in, what rank they achieved, because we were looking at all that for po potential leadership. So anybody that had military experience, especially in the higher ranks, the, those people would be naturally looked at for leadership positions in the party because they had those skills.

Right. But how did they try to recruit military people?

So using the same tactics as everybody else, but the, as far as the organization specifically, having that military structure like we discussed earlier, having that structure gave them. So somebody that was coming out of the military that was retired or something like that, it would provide that structure that they were missing. So a lot of times for people that are involved in this stuff, it's a psych, it's fulfilling a psychological need. It's being part of a mission. It's having that, something that's driving them and driving their, for driving a driving force that's behind their ideology. So finding a place to fit in, having, having a mission, a sense of purpose. I think it's a lot of things that a lot of times people miss that aspect of it. And I explain it not to excuse it, 'cause there is no excuse for it. These are choices that people make. But if You understand the psychology of it and like why someone's involved in it, that's helpful to help pull them out. And, and also when someone's coming out of these organizations to have a new mission, have something else, right? So for, for a lot of people that might be learning to play guitar or doing an extreme sport or getting involved with the church or just, it could be anything, but it has, there has to be something. 'cause if they're missing that, that's when they really struggle. That's, that's one thing I've seen a lot of.

So what, what is the protocol? Like, how do you handle, like say if someone is leaving and they contact you and say, I know you left, I, I wanna leave too. What are, what are the steps you take to make sure that they do find some sort of a new purpose?

A lot of times just kind of asking them questions, you know, asking a lot of questions and seeing what they're interested in and find, and finding those things. Trying to help them find that sense of purpose and, and that, because that's missing. So I've had a lot of people say, like, when they've left, they're like, I don't have that. I don't have that. So we, a lot of times we'll talk through that. Well, what interests you? What are you, what are you interested in? A lot of times we try to keep 'em kind of steer clear politics, but for some people it might be okay. But typically that's, that's kind of a, probably a one they should stay away from for a little bit.

So politics, because there's, they, they have this desire to help fix society. Yeah. So they think they're gonna get involved. I'm not a Nazi anymore, so I'll get involved in fixing it in a more legitimate way. Yep.

And one of the problems, Joe, is this, when these people leave the movement, there is a moniker that's tagged on them and a stigma that follows. Okay. You know, when, when you see their name in the media, it is never, you know, Jeff Scoop, blah, blah, blah. It's always former neo-Nazi Jeff Scoop or

Neo Nazi doesn't say former rock musician.

No.

Had some wacky ideas, but let's not talk about

That.

You know? So, so that stigma kind of follows, you know, of course it's hard for them to break. Right. You know, where whereby most people, you know, when they screw up or whatever, you know, it is forgiven. Like say, you know, you and I are friends. I call you and say, Hey Joe, man, you're not gonna believe this last weekend. And I got, I got thrown in jail for, for, for, for D-D-D-W-I, you know, you, you'd be like, well man, you know, you need to quit drinking and driving. You know, why didn't you call me? I would've come picked you up. You don't have to drive home. Whatever. And, and you and I would still be friends, but, but if I call you and say, Hey man, you know, I I got arrested for, for murder or for rape, you'd be like, why are you calling me? You know? Right, right, right. Distancing. So even though these people might have been friends with somebody who later became a white supremacist or whatever, the stigma of it, even now that they're out. Right. You know, they still are a little leery and wanna stay clear 'cause you're judged by the company you keep. So it's always, you know, excon, you know, blah, blah, blah, you know, instead of just saying, so and so is working here.

Yeah. I mean, there's very few people that even wanna believe that someone's capable of leaving. Right.

Exactly. The tiger stripes in leopard.

Yes. They would always think like, this guy's gotta be fucked up. He's, he was a Nazi.

Yeah. And, and it's, it's crazy because I had a reporter one time, and I won't say who or anything like that, but he had said, you know, I visit a murderer in, in prison and, and I'm okay with that, but I'm not so sure about like, your journey. Like I'm, I mean, like, he basically, what he was saying in so many words was he was more comfortable with the murderer than somebody. And this is a, this is a, a, a reporter, you know, somebody, a journalist, and they were more uncomfortable speaking with a former neo-Nazi.

That's fascinating. Yeah. Were they Jewish? No, no, no. Definitely liberal.

Yes. Yeah. Yes, for

Sure. I think the, the stigma of it is just so unforgivable, you know, which is part of the problem. So,

But then why, why, if you're not gonna forgive that person or that ideology Right. Then why do you wanna fight it? Why do you want to combat it? Why not just accept it? Because it's not gonna change. Or at least you're not gonna change your attitude towards it.

Right. You have to help in if, if you want these people to leave and reintegrate into society, you have to have forgiveness.

Exactly. I mean, you know, prison is a, is a penal institution, not a reform institution. Which is why this country has the highest recidivism rate of any country in the world. Right. People, you know, run there and they don't get reformed. And they, they learn from better people than they were at, at their crime. Right. And they go back out and they do it again. And people don't accept them. Right. 'cause they have that stigma that follows them. Well, I can't hire an ex-con, you know, blah, blah, blah, whatever. Right. Where do they go? Right. And so you said

An interesting side note on that. You know, we talk about like, some of the, the hate that I had and I was a raging antisemite more than a racist by at, at all, by all points. And the irony of today working with the Simon Weisenthal Center, I mean, there's just so much irony there. And like the Jewish community was the community that I dehumanized and villainized the most. And Joe, they have been the most accepting and welcoming as far as since the change has happened. And that just blew my mind. 'cause I, I, the first time I went to speak at a synagogue, I thought, man, these people are gonna wanna stone me to death. You know, like, I, what should I say? How am I gonna, you know, how, what is this gonna be like? I'd never been in a synagogue before. And this was, this took place in Skokie, Illinois. And I tell you, after, after speaking there, I got more hugs and more love and compassion than I'd probably any other place I could ever remember being.

That's really interesting. So did they try to understand like why you at one point in time hated Jews? Did they, did they ask you questions? Like, what, what did you think?

Yeah, yeah. I mean, well, they have something called teshuva, which means like forgiveness or, or repentance and antique ole means to he to heal the world. So these were things that were counterintuitive and, and contrary to everything that I thought I knew about the Jews,

Now you to speaking Hebrew, You understand?

Right.

Yeah. So, but it was, it was really bizarre. So it's like when I speak with kids at schools, you know, I said, you know, you guys remember in elementary school and you had opposite day and your shirt's backwards and all that kind of stuff. I said, that was my life. Like, everything that I thought that I knew about the, the Jews and the movement, I was an expert on the Jews, the Jewish question, you know? And here,

Did you have any experience with Jewish people?

No. None.

No. So this was all just based on Nazi ideology? Yep. Huh. So you'd No, no negative or positive interactions with Jewish people? No,

Very li towards the end of my time when I was involved, you know, I had a few interactions with Jewish people, but bef that I knew of. But before that, no, absolutely not. Just wouldn't discuss anything with them. Wouldn't talk to them. And, and just felt like they were inherently evil, swallowed the whole anti-Semitic pill, I guess you could say. I mean, I believed all of it. And they, they were the people that I dehumanized the most. And yet today, they're the people that have been the most open.

And, you know, for the longest time, you know, Jews have been blamed for everything. Things, you know, they had nothing to do with, they say, you know, the Jews run the media, they own the media. They, you know, they, they, they, they run the banking systems and all that kind of stuff. And so people begin believing in that and that, and they become, you know, persona non grata. And even though may, they may not, may not even know any Jewish people. And that's why I say, you know, when, when I feel I can trust, you know, some individual who trusts me or whatever, around my friends, I will, I will invite them over or whatever. And I bring in some Jewish friends of mine and other black friends or white friends so that they can see something outside the echo chamber. Another former neo-Nazi, who's a very good friend of mine, was telling me that when he was in,

That's funny, funny sentence, another moron, right. Former neo-Nazi, who's a very good friend of mine.

A Freudian slip. No,

It's, it's accurate.

Exactly. Yeah. So anyway, he was telling me when he was in the movement, he, he's, he's from Wisconsin and you know, their, their football team is the Green Bay Packers, and they're just, you know, crazy about their football team. And so he would tell me, you know, they're not allowed to watch football games because there's inter interracial, you know, you got black and, and white members on the teams playing together. So that's forbidden. And so he'd have to sneak around and watch, turn the volume down and, and watch the game.",,,"Daryl Davis is a blues musician, race relations expert, and author of several books, including ""The Klan Whisperer.""

And when the Packers would, would score a goal, he'd do like this and that.

Right.

And so then he tells me that, you know, when he got out and, and other people were, you know, were, were getting out, turns out they were doing the same thing, you know, you know,

Watching the game. Oh, that's so crazy.

But he has a great story telling about, about the guys from Cameroon.

Oh, yeah, yeah. So I had met some embassy people from the, the country of Cameroon in Africa. And they had come out to one of my talks and, and afterwards, you know, they said, you know, I, it was really fascinating and, and America is really far behind on race relations, you know, when we first got here, we didn't realize we were black. And I was like, what? That's are you talking about? I said, we gotta talk, I gotta understand this. What do you mean you didn't realize you are black? And he's like, well, of course we realize we're black, but you see in the United States, you know, or where we're from in Cameroon, we're Cameroonian. You know, that's who we are. Like, you know, we know we're black. But he goes, you know, in the United States it's different.

You're black American, white American, you know? Yeah.

He says, we are treated differently in the United States, even by other black people, you know? Oh, we

Were treated

Differently. So he says, now we know we're black.

Wow. I was like, wow.

I took a minute to wrap my mind around that one.

It's fascinating. Well, it makes sense. They think of themselves as Cameroonian. Yeah. As

As they should. Yeah.

As they should. Yes. Yeah. Yep. Wow. Yeah. That's what's crazy when you experience racism from other black people, you're like, whoa. Right.

Well now hold on. Now, you know, or

Discrimination I should say.

Well, when you, when you experience it from anybody, right. But understand something. Okay. So, you know, we, we have a unique thing here called slavery. And, and Jewish people have a unique thing called the Holocaust. So if you are a white guy and you are walking down down the street, the sidewalk, and some other white guy is coming up the sidewalk, you don't know him, just a stranger. You know, you guys are gonna pass and not say a thing to, to e to to either one. You know, just, just go on by. Right. If it's a black guy, two black guys passing, they don't, they're going, yo man, what's up? They're gonna acknowledge one another because they have a shared experience. They both are descendants of slaves. They both have experienced racism at some point in their life or whatever. If, if two Jews pass who don't know each other, they're gonna go shalom because of that commonality, that experience. Okay. So unless you've had that experience, you don't, you don't react to it. Alright. So when I lived in Africa, on the continent of Africa for 10 years, I lived in Ethiopia, Ghana, Guinea, and Senegal, and visited many other countries in between 'cause of my dad's job. Right. So I can tell you, you know, all black people don't look alike. All black people don't know each other. Alright? And

That's a funny thing to say too, but you,

But you, yeah, but you know what, a lot of white people think that they, they do a lot. Yeah. Especially older, older ones. Oh, okay. Now, at one time, in, in a city, all black people probably did know each other. Okay. Because they had to go to the same school and there was only one black school in the town. Right. They couldn't go different white schools. Okay. So, yeah. You know, you, they could only shop in a certain store. They couldn't shop in every store or restaurant. Right. So yeah, they would run into each other more often. But today, you know, no, but the stigma is still there. Okay. The sentiment, especially with older people. So anyway, if I'm walking down the street and I've had this happen and some black guy from Africa is coming up the street, I go, Hey man, what's up? You know, I don't know the guy, he looks at me like, kind of strange. Like, why? I don't know you, why are you talking to me? 'cause he doesn't have that experience. Right?

Right.

So we're not, you know, we're not, we're not monolithic.

Right? Yeah. Well, that, that this is the only way these movements, like the neo-Nazis work, is if you don't know a lot of people from all over the world and realize we're all just people. Yep. This is, you know, it's, and it is very fear based. Right? Yeah. Because I mean, think about it, you're, you're clinging to the lowest common denominator. You all have a certain amount of melanin in your skin, and you're all from a certain part of the world. That's it. And it's really not a very good commonality. It's bound, it's terrible. Yes. Especially when you think about the differences in personalities and tastes and just how people behave. And it's not a good indicator at all. No. It's the dumbest. It really, it really is. But now there's no bearing on your character, no bearing on your intellect, no bearing on any of the things that we find fascinating and attractive about people. It's just the color of your skin, which is the dumbest fucking thing on earth. Absolutely.

And, you know, and, and we all may engage in it somewhat. Like for example, if I like Chinese food and if I go to a Chinese restaurant, I don't wanna see a bunch of white college kids or black college kids for that matter in the kitchen cooking it for me. Right. You know, I want the authentic real deal. Right. You know, so am I being prejudice?

No, that's not prejudice. That's You wanna experience the culture. The culture. Yeah, exactly. Like if I go to an Italian restaurant, I'm assuming there's gonna be a bunch of old school Italian people back there cooking. You know, I want, I want, I want heavy accents. You know, I want the smell of garlic in the air. You know what I'm saying?

Do you know where Italians came from

Originally? Yeah. I mean, I'm assuming Italy.

Well, that's what they live.

I mean, what are you trying to say? Well, I,

I'm gonna tell you. Okay. Okay. So Italians came from Africa. They came from the Moors. Oh

Yes. Well, Sicily in particular, that's actually where my family's

From. Okay. Well there you go. Okay. And they're darker in Sicily Right. Than in Rome and Venice and wherever else. Right, right. The further you move from the equator, the, the darker the skin. Right. Okay. Yeah. The Moors came, you know, and into there where we all evolved from Africa at some point in time, way back when. Right. But you know, a lot of people don't realize that, you know, and they really need to check their DNA and check their history rather than just take it from where they started, where they were born. You know, that's why I think it's so important to not ban books and ban and rewrite history at Oma.

Of course. Yeah, of course. You know, there is some indication that human beings might have come out of Asia as well. In fact, one of the oldest known human skeletons that they found, which predates Lucy. No, it's another one that Lucy. Lucy, well,

Lucy is outta Ethiopia.

Right. But Lucy wasn't a homo sapien. They found something that is a homo sapien that's 500,000 years older than when they thought homo sapiens existed. This is very recent. Wow. And so it was likely that this was taking place in multiple areas of the world, just like there's different animals in multiple places of the world. There's different primates in multiple places of the world, and there's a bunch of different kinds of human being of course. Right. There's Dennis VINs, which have just recently discovered. And then there was the, the Hobbit people on the island of Flores. Like there's a lot of, when it comes to the, the evolutionary history of human beings is very, very odd. But when you talk about like the cultural history of human beings, that's when things get really crazy because it was just a lot of people like traveling all over the place and just settling into the climate. And the reason why white people are white is just 'cause there is no sun. It's that simple. And they had to develop essentially like a giant solar panel to suck up vitamin D because they weren't getting any vitamin D from the sun. It's really that simple. And that's when it gets real weird,

Which has nothing to do with their intelligence or lack thereof. Zero.

Zero. You know, it, it's all environmental. And over the course of hundreds of thousands of years, people change their appearance. And you know, when you tell people that, they're like, wait, what? Right. Yeah. We, we all came from the same source. We're all destroy. It destroys, destroys. That's destroys why we could all have babies, you know, like other animals that are very different. Like there's certain fish that can have babies with other fish, but those, those fish become infertile, you know? And then like the, the same with like donkeys. Like donkeys, they don't, they can't have babies. You know, like it's a, or or mules rather can't have babies because it's a, a cross between a donkey and a horse. And you can do it, but then it can't make babies or a liger can't make babies. Right, right. But people can make babies with people obviously. 'cause we're the same fucking thing. Yeah. Right.

Any, any, any culture of people.

Yes. Yes. Any culture of people can have babies with other cultures of people. 'cause we all come from the same source kind of wipes out the whole racism argument. Doesn't the stupid, it's the stupidest fucking thing ever because it's adaptive to environment. It's

Always your DN my DNA, his DNA are 99.9% the same. Yep,

Yep,

Yep. And that should be taught in elementary school. Yeah. Yes. Don't wait to, to teach it in college when people's minds are already solidified.

Yes, yes. Yes. I think that thing too, that exposure that you had to, that Nazi coming to visit you, even though it's negative exposure, it's probably good to see, you know, like when I was a kid, I was in high school when I was 14, Barney Frank, who

Oh yeah, I remember him. Yeah.

He, he wasn't openly gay then, but he was like one of the first openly gay members of Congress. He lived near me. He lived near me as well. I lived in Massachusetts at the time. And he was from Massachusetts, or was representative of Massachusetts. So

When he lived in DC as a congressman.

Oh, okay. So this was before that, I guess then, so he was debating a member of what at the time was the, I believe it was the moral majority. And it was this really goofy guy who came out and he had like an American flag on his lapel. And I remember I was 14, and you know, when you're 14 and you see someone who's got this very, like, he was very anti-gay marriage, very anti, a lot of things, but he was a clumsy n it wasn't very eloquent, not a very compelling speaker. And then Barney Frank went up, you know, so they both spoke, spoke, this guy spoke, and then Barney Frank and Barney Frank was so much smoother, so much more articulate. He was like, and for every, all the kids that I was in school with who left, they're like, that guy made more sense. Like, this is a good thing to see. It's good that they see someone with a very narrow-minded, bigoted perspective. And then someone who is more intelligent, more has a much better vocabulary, smoother in their ability to disseminate information and to dissect the bad arguments of the other person. So we all walked out of there with like, oh, okay. And then, you know, I remember talking about it with my friends, like, yeah, that guy's a fucking moron. Let first guy, you know, like, and but nowadays, instead of that, you would only get one. You would only get the one person talking. But the one person talking without the other person talking is not as good. And this idea of protecting kids from bad ideas, because they don't want these kids to be indoctrinated by bad ideas. It doesn't work with human beings. The way to get rid of bad ideas is to confront them with better ideas. Exactly. Yep. And the fear of having these kind of debates in schools is really dangerous. It's dangerous for discourse, it's dangerous for the development of the ability to have arguments and ideas, and to be able to debate you, you have to see it done. You have to see bad thinking, good thinking. Ah, I get it. I get it. This guy's, he's more, he's more clever. He's thinking better, he's got more information. This makes sense. Yep. And if you don't allow people to make those distinctions on their own, if you just baby them and treat them like you can't expose them to these negative ideas, you, you miss out on the possibility of accepting nuance and an understanding of how a less sophisticated, less educated person can fall into these traps of these stupid ideologies.

You just nailed it. Right on. You know, right on the head man. Allowing them to see the difference. Yes. Okay. Because you know, people, how did you change those people? Darrell? No, I didn't change them. They changed themselves. Because we all know one's perception is one's reality. Right. Whatever somebody perceives becomes their reality, even if it's not real, it's their reality. Right. You cannot change their reality. And if you try, you're gonna get resistance. Right. 'cause they, they only know what they know. Right. If you keep trying, it's gonna escalate. You're gonna get loud and keep on trying, it's gonna explode. You, you call, it's gonna be rolling around on the ground, hitting each other or whatever. Right? 'cause all fights start with yelling and screaming. Right. So rather, it is, rather than try to attack somebody's reality and try to set their reality straight, don't do that. You'll fail. What you do is you offer them a better perception or perceptions. Yes. And if they resonate with one of your perceptions, like showing them, this guy speaks very eloquently. That guy speaks like a, like, like a moron. Right. Just let them see it. Yeah. Okay. That perception then resonates with them and they change their own reality. Yeah. So don't focus on how you're gonna change somebody's reality. Focus on what kind of perceptions can I offer that person that might resonate. Right?

Right. And just by example, but who by who you are. Because when people see someone speak and it resonates with them and see someone speak and they, you can sense how they think of things. You can see the thought process and you go, well, who do I admire more? I admire this guy. He is like, he's, he's thinking like, this is a, an enlightened person. This is a person who's thinking in a way that I want to be able to think like that. Especially as a young kid, you know, you don't wanna be a moron when you see someone you think is a moron. You're like, okay, I'm glad I saw that guy because that guy looks like a fucking idiot. Now this guy, oh, that guy makes more sense. You know?

So what's happening?

It's all good, man. When

Are you bailing outta your country? It's sinking that, that is the fucking Titanic. And you are one of the last deckhands.

We're gonna, we're gonna stand and fight, man. Yeah.

Are

You really?

Yeah. Good

Luck. No, we are. Good

Luck. We're the guys playing

As long as it's still okay. They're

Arrest you for saying stand and fight. It is a excitement of violence.

Yeah.

Yeah, yeah. No, but it's got, it's interesting. I mean, obviously you had Graham Linehan on the show. We are gonna have him on as well soon to talk about it. But he, his, they're not gonna prosecute him. And not only that, they also said they are not going to investigate noncrime hate incidents anymore. Do you know what those

Are? Oh, interesting.

It's basically when you've committed no crime, but you're still like hateful.

Oh, okay. But that's also very subjective too.

Yeah, of course. Of course. So they're not, they're not gonna investigate them anymore. Yeah. But they're still gonna keep track of them is what they said.

Oh, keep track. Just, we've got an eye on you. We're gonna make,

We're gonna make a record of it, but won't investigating. So

Are they gonna stop arresting people for social media posts then?

What do you think, Joe? I think,

No,

I think it's

Profitable.

I think that's,

Well, yeah. It's probably a nice fine. Right? What do you get? You get a fine.

I don't think it's about that. I think, you know, during the, the uber woke era, they put all these laws on the stature book, and the police have to enforce the law. Right. They have no choice. 'cause if a bunch of people complain and then they don't investigate the people that have been reported. Oh,

That's

What it's all about. They get in trouble. Of course. Like if you, the ordinary, like, you know, police officers, right. Police officers don't like enforcing these dumb laws. Of course. It's put on them from above. Yeah.

I just didn't know that all that stuff was put in place in your country during the woke era.

Yeah, it was.

And the heavy rope, it's almost like a fever dream, you know, when you really go back and pay attention to some of the more insane woke stuff from like, just five years ago. Yeah. Like everyone was losing their fucking mind. It. But like, if I was an elite, if I was one of those lizard people running the world, I'd have been like, well, look here, this is really interesting. Like, this was just a cold, it was just a cold and a little bit of social media input. And we got these people behaving in a way that they'd never behaved before. Admitting to things they'd never admitted to before. Adhering to rules. It never existed before.

Yeah. I, I think the thing that I found the most, the, the worst bit about, it wasn't necessarily the behavior of the elites, it was the behavior of ordinary people during that time. Yeah. The fact that your neighbor was so willing to snitch on you because you went for a second walk.

Well, that's why I was interested in it as a lizard person. If I was a lizard person elite, I'd be like, look, these people are dumb. Like, this is really easy to manipulate. Especially, I was just talking to a buddy of mine who's fleeing LA and he was like, I can't anymore. I tried. I just fucking, I hung in there. I can't do it anymore. It's like everybody went crazy. Mm. It's like, it, there's something that happened because of the pandemic and the Black Lives Matter protests and the riots and all the ca It just cha like, whatever the temperature of society was is like, it hit societal global warming where it's like, it's time to investigate Greenland. It's time to move north. Like this is a bad climate now. This sucks. Mm.

And LA is a perfect example of this. 'cause we talk about this all the time. You get outta the airport at LAX, you feel that la sun on your skin and you just go, this is paradise. Yeah. It's the, the whole. And then you walk out and you see this, it's paradise. And they fucked it up so bad that people will literally pack up and leave paradise.

What Donald Trump should do is when he leaves the office run for governor of California, they just take over California and fix it. It would be hilarious if he did. It would be one of the funniest things of all time. If an 82-year-old man steps into the office of governor of California, we're gonna fix everything. You've got a problem with water. I know how to get the water. It would be fucking hilarious. But

It's almost like there. So there's a very old joke about Venezuela, where God was creating Venezuela, and he was like, you know what I'm gonna do? I'm gonna make sure they have diamonds, they have gold, they have desert, but they also have jungle. They have beautiful beaches. It's gonna be rich in oil and the whole, and then, well, the entire world goes, Hey, that's unfair. Like, they've gotta have something bad. And God goes, yeah, you know what? You're right. Let's give them the Venezuelans. And that's almost like that with California. You're like, California's too perfect. You know what I mean? It's got everything you need. Right? So what are you gonna do? You've gotta give them something fucked up. And it's just these crazy people who believe in these stupid ideas. But

It wasn't for a long time. Mm. I mean, you gotta realize Arnold was the governor of California. Mm. Right? And then, you know, Ronald Reagan's from California. He was the governor of California at one time. He too, it wasn't always that nuts. And when you went back to when I went there in the 1990s, it was much more moderate politically. Hmm. Like, you know, people were definitely left leaning, but it wasn't a focus. It wasn't a thing that was discussed all the time. It would just, it wasn't. And I remember working with many, like older actors who were openly conservative. No one cared. It was just like, oh, this is Bob. You know, he's really into Bob Dole. Like, you know, it wasn't, it wasn't unusual. Something happened around the Obama administration. Something happened specifically around his second term that really changed everything. And if you look at like, internet, like searches and use of certain words, especially racism. Yes. It flies. It just hits a

Giant leap. Right? 2014. Yes. 2014. Right around

Then.

Yeah. Yeah. And it's not just in America. It's literally everywhere in the world. Yeah. That's why I think it's social media that's caused that.

A hundred percent. It's social media and it's, it's, there's a, there's a bunch of factors. But the problem is now that the genie's outta the bottle, they know how easy we are to manipulate. And I don't think people are learning. They're toing all day long, and they're just like getting blasted with all this negativity and strife and global conflict and Colombian assassinations. That's what I get a, a lot of these assassinations in like cafes. Someone pulls up on a scooter, bang, bang, and they drive off and everybody screams. I've seen a hundred thousand of those I've seen. You know, it's like, everybody's like completely ramped up. And at the same time, you've got people in the UK getting arrested for Facebook posts about immigration.

So I think part of the problem is, is that people, when they go on these posts, they're not looking for to learn something, as you just said, what they actually want is an emotional reaction. They want to feel something, right. If you live in a society where it's comparatively the easiest it's ever been, and your life is boring. 'cause all you do is get up, you go to work, you go, you have food, you commute, you come back. It's essentially a treadmill where you don't feel any of the ups and downs of emotion. Right. Then what way would you get that? But by going online and seeing something fucking awful happening, you feel terror, you feel sadness, you feel rage. At it's most basic, you feel alive.

Well, it's also just, that's what you're gonna watch. You know? And so you're getting sucked into it just because of the algorithm, which is crazy. We no one ever considered algorithms before. We considered access to information, but we didn't consider that information be curated to hold your attention span. Mm. And all these factors have not been studied. Well, you know, there's been a few guys like Jonathan Haight writing about a few scholars that are really attempting to like, say, Hey, what is a, what's a sociological and what, what are the, what is the long term consequences of this happening? Also for children? These are the first children in the, in human history, growing up on social media, never been done before. We don't know what that's like, like what is it gonna change in terms of empathy, in terms of hostility, acceptance of violence, which is a completely brand new thing on the left. Acceptance and celebration of gun violence never happened before. When I was a kid, it never existed. No one from the left ever celebrated anybody getting assassinated, ever. It just wasn't a thing.

It's so crazy, man. And you're talking about like language as well? Like we have this, we have the leader of the Green Party in the uk, new guys coming through. He's very popular with people on the left, on, on that side of the left. Anyway. And it's been, what, how long has it been since Charlie Kirk was assassinated? Like a month. Yeah. Right. And he's running around calling like, not, not far. Right. People just like Nigel Farage is a Nazi, is a fascist. And you're just, and you're going, you and I, and we've discussed this so many times with you, man. It's like when you call people these words, like if you and I and Francis thought the Nazis were here to take over, we'd all fight them. Hmm. So what do you expect people to do when you put you are put in the target? This

On people's backs. You

Are 100%. And you're doing it in just for political persuasion, power. That's really all. It's, that's what it's, it's like no one really believes Nigel Farage is a fucking Nazi. He's kind of goofy, but he's not a Nazi. Like the what is a Nazi then. And that here's the real problem. This is what nobody wants to admit. If you are in Nazi Germany and you're a 20-year-old man and you're German, and everyone in your town is a Nazi, you are probably a Nazi too. Or you're Jew and you're running Mm Yeah. You're running from these motherfuckers. So either you're a Jew or you're a Nazi, you're either Jewish or you're, you're a fucking evil part of history that everybody refers to as the worst people of all time.

Absolutely. And you know, we're talking That's

Scary.

Yeah. That, but it's human nature. Sorry, Francis. It's just we interviewed David Buss yesterday. You've had him on, right? Mm, yes. Evolutionary. I mean, he, he, this is one of the things he talked about is like, within us is the ability we have good adaptations and we have evil adaptations. Yeah. And if you put people in the certain context, and those adaptations are in all of us.

Yeah. Donner party. People eat people. Yeah. Yeah. You get get down to, I might die or I might eat somebody. You eat people. Yeah. The guy's already dead. We should just eat them. And then you all sit around and go, oh my God, are we really gonna eat a person? And then you're eating a person, like everybody does. They all have very few people just starve to death when you could just eat a person who's already dead.

And it's, you know, Zach Polanski, what he does is, to me, this is the

Green party guy.

The green party guy is completely wrong. But then there are people on the far left. So there's a member parliament called Zara. Tana. Yes. That is her real name. Zara Tana. And yeah,

She sounds like a boss in a video game.

Yeah.

Well,

What's really interesting is she has, she put a clip on her social media where she goes and she set up this new far left political party. And she says, we've gotta fight Fasci in parliament. We gotta fight them in the ballot box. And you're going, all right, look, I don't like the, the rhetoric. And then she says something even more interesting and we've gotta fight them in the streets. Now you think to yourself, right, if you classify Nigel Farage and the people who vote reform in the uk, which may well win the general election, which may well be the biggest political party and already represents a sizable portion of the uk, you are effectively advocating violence. And it's incitement to violence as far as I'm concerned. But because she's on the far less, she's deemed to be a good person, that's somehow okay. Whereas if Nigel said something like that along those lines, you know, that people would be like, this is a fascist, this is evil, this is disgusting. You shouldn't say that.

You are also weaponizing mental illness. 'cause one of the things that we know now very clearly, because of all these YouTube videos, all these people that go to these protests and start interviewing folks, some of these people are clearly not well. And this is the thing they've attached themselves to. This is their tribe. This is whether it's no kings or fuck ice or whatever, whatever the tribe is, this is their tribe now. And the, they're schizophrenic or their, you know, fill in the blank, whatever the mental illness is, and you're weaponizing them by calling these people who just differ with you politically or more conservative. You're calling these people the enemy of humanity. Mm. It's very

Scary. It is. Right. And you know, I'm one of the people that has gone along to a lot of protests. There's a lot of wild people there.

Oh yeah. You've done some great interviews at those protests. Mm, yeah. It's just when they're confronted with a person who's actually asking them questions, it's remarkable how few people know why they're there. Mm. They don't, they don't know.

"ng people to protest, and if there's documentation that the metadata from the cell phones are the same from protest to protest, and that they're traveling on buses that's paid for with tax dollars. Like, hold on. What are you really doing? What are you really doing? This isn't really an organic protest. That's right. You funneled money through an NGO and now you are hiring people to show up and wave signs to give the illusion look at, this is what they did during the Kamala Harris campaign. They filled up stadiums with people coming to see her. And the same people went from stadium to, it became a job. It became a job, but it gave the illusion. So that's deception. That's deception. And that should not be legal. That should not be a legal thing to do. You're engaging in propaganda. You know, you're, you're openly manipulating people's perspective. Ba you know, you're paying these, those aren't audience members. Those are cl those are customers. That's right. You're paying them. Yeah.

And what, what, what is your take? What is it that they want When they say no kings, they, they, what do they want? They think

Donald Trump is behaving like a king.

How so?

Because, well, he ran on a platform and was elected and won every swing state and the popular vote. And then once he got in, he did exactly what he said he was gonna do, which is exactly

What a king does.

Makes.

And then he let them protest, which is also what a king does, right? Yeah. Like, no, no. He didn't send the troops to stop the protest. In fact, he congratulated them on doing a great job. And I'm, and he said, I'm still your president. Yeah.

I saw that

Tweets fucking hilarious. Yeah. It's very funny. It's a very funny, like, pull up is the tweet that he made. I guess it's not a tweet. It's like, which I still say tweet. I tried.

It's a truth.

It's a, I tried X for a while and I can't say it. I say Twitter,

It's still a tweet. I

Might say X, but you tweeted. That's right. You know, and if it's truth social, it's gonna make its way to Twitter. And then it's a tweet. Yeah. Yeah. It's like can't you can't ret truth something that doesn't even make any sense.

You know, the thing that we have in this country, I dunno if you have it in this country as much, is just the, the way the policing is biased. The way that they will arrest Graham Linehan for three relatively innocuous tweets. One of them was a joke and they will arrest him the moment he lands on British soil. Five police officers. You, you get other people saying he heinous things. Or you get, like I said, the example Zara Saltana saying, you know, we're gonna fight them in the streets. Right. But that's fine. Right. And nothing comes from that. That's

Ridiculous. Well, no, there was a guy who was at a protest.

I'm looking at his, I don't know which

Account it was on. He, he was a, he, he was a member of political party.

I think you could probably find an image of it. 'cause it was posted everywhere.

There was a guy called, I think his name was Ricky Jones. He said at a protest, we need to slit the throats of the far right. Oh, great. And he was found not guilty.

Oh great. And Graham Lenihan gets arrested. Right. Ay, what are they trying to do to England? It was always such a lovely place to visit.

Well, this is what I was gonna ask you. I wish more people in Britain recognize how fucking crazy this looks to the rest of the world. Oh, well you guys must be looking at us going, what the fuck is this?

We can't believe it. We literally can't believe it. When I tell people that don't know that 12,000 people this year were arrested in Britain for posting things on social media. Their, their jaw drops. Like what? I go, dude, they're going crazy over there. Like, you have to pay attention. You have to pay attention. 'cause this kinda shit is contagious. And if it gets into Germany and then it gets into Spain or it gets into other countries, like it can become a real fucking problem. Like, then you have full on military dictatorship in England. 'cause that's what it always leads to. It. 100% leads to military dictatorship. Yeah. If you're telling people they can't do things and you're trying to install socialism and then you get it in place, there's only one way to keep it in place. You gotta use the fucking army. That's the only way you gotta get men with guns to tell people you can only make so much money. You have to give away this. We're gonna take that. We're the only ones, ones who grow food. We're the only ones who do this. We're gonna sign you a job. Like you fucked up. You fell into the, the age old trap that's been exposed by history over and over and over again. And people are like, we're gonna do it right this time. And they got blue hair and a fucking mask on and a cat t-shirt. And they're morbidly obese and they're just marching down the street. And we're gonna let them run the country like England, which used to run like most of the fucking world. One island of savages ran most of the world. And now you're getting an overrun with nonsense and you're arresting people for saying, Hey, maybe we shouldn't have rape gangs. You know, maybe, maybe we shouldn't, maybe we shouldn't tolerate lawlessness in the streets.

Oh, absolutely. I mean, it got so ridiculous in the UK that the Supreme Court had to get involved to make a decision whether boys had PPEs and girls have Fus,

PPEs and Fus. That's an interesting way to put it.

Yeah. That's it. But, but the reason I'm using that language is just to highlight how,

How silly it is. How

Completely ridiculous it is.

That's crazy. Well, how about when they asked when Supreme Court Justice Kaji Brown Jackson was being sworn in when they were talking to her during the confirmation part, they asked her, what is a woman? And she's like, I'm not a biologist. Like, but you're a actual woman. Right? Like, who? I believe she has children, right? Mm. So she's a woman who's given birth. You know exactly what a woman is like. This is not But they

Don't fucking know though. I

Know's what's crazy. That's what's crazy. They're playing this game. They're

Playing the game. Yeah.

Yeah.

They're playing the game. But, but these aren't like inconsequential people. No Supreme Court justice. I know. Playing this game, playing

The dumbest game that's ever been played. It's the dumbest And it's weird, man. It's a weird game. You know, it's a weird game. Like, what is a woman like here's the, here's the real funny part. No one asks what is a man? And no one gives a fuck if you're a woman and you pretend to be a man. 'cause you're not gonna victimize men. That's the dirty little thing that they're covering up about All this is you're opening up the door to people that now have a Willy Wonka golden ticket to pretend that they're a woman and be around women, and then dominate women's spaces, and dominate women's sports, and dominate all kinds of things that women are involved in just with their personalities. Like the overbearing fucking shitty male personalities over overbearing and, and taking over women's groups. Yeah. It's fucking nuts. And if you're, and if you're not them, then you're, if you don't support that, then you're a turf. And they're like, we could shoot turfs. And then there's like punch a turf and, and, and they think that because they're a woman, it's okay for this woman, this trans woman to do violence on a biological woman, which is like bananas. Yeah. Like now, now we're, now we're allowing men to beat up women because they say they're a woman. It's just two women fighting. Well, no, that's not, that's not what that is at all. This is, you just did something that's completely insane and it's a giant chunk of the population that accept that. And if you say something about it, then you're transphobic or you're, you're hateful or you're a part of the patriarchy or whatever. Fill in the blank. Whatever the problem is. But like, you're not addressing that. You open the door to one specific group. That's always been the most horrible group in our society. It's creepy, pervert men that wanna fucking prey on women. And now you're letting them into the locker room and you don't have a solution to that. So you just don't want me talking about it. That's the weird part. 'cause no one gives a fuck about trans men going in the bathroom. You wanna go in the bathroom and pee next to me? Who cares? You, you want me to tell you want me to call you Bob now? Bob? Okay. I'm fine with, it doesn't, you're not taking anything from men. Mm. You're not taking anything. You're not inserting yourself into that world and dominating it. You're just, you know, you're LARPing

Well, they don't wanna admit that there's sometime sometimes a conflict between the rights of different groups. Right. They wanna pretend that it's just about empathy. And you can have, but you can't, you can't simultaneously have empathy for women as you are describing. And also for people who want to be the, the opposite sex in a women's bathroom. Those two things are in direct conflict. Direct, direct conflict. And you are gonna have to come out for one side or the other. It would

Be one thing if that was never an issue. That there were never men that ever did anything negative to women. If there was no rape ever, it was never done. It was impossible. If no one ever did it, then you would go, well this is just a non-issue. It's just a place where you wash your hands. But it's not a place where you wash your hands. It's a place where you go to the bathroom. Yeah. And there's prison changed prisons. It's prisons. Prisons. Prisons. Yeah. People who are violent against women say they're a woman. They get put in women's prisons where they rape women. That's been done. Yeah. Yeah. Like, like it made its way that far down the ladder. And like the aliens are probably like waiting to show us the gravity drive. They're like right about to like, no, no. Look what they're doing. Yeah. They're not ready yet.

Know what's really fascinating is a cognitive dissonance that these people have. 'cause on the one hand they would say that we live in a patriarchal rape culture where women are subjugated and oppressed and you know, and how awful it is for women. And then on the other hand, they're like, yeah, right Derek, you now say you're a woman right on this way.

But they see, they get past that with trans women or women. They just say it trans women or women and that's it. And it's like the discussion's over Mm. It's like, okay, are you sure? Are you fucking sure? You know, like maybe some of them are Mm. Like do you don't think there's any perverts left? They all got absorbed into the community and reformed. Like what happened? What happened to the guy from Silence of the Lambs? You know, what happened to Ed Gain? He's, you know, this ed gain documentary on Netflix. Have you guys watched any of it? No, it's not a documentary. I should say it's a docudrama with that heartthrob fellow, what's that guy's name? Who plays Ed Gain? He's really good man. It's really creepy. But a lot of it deals with Autogynephilia where Ed Gain used to wear his mom's clothes and he would jack off. And then he started, after his mom died, he tried to dig his mom up. He couldn't dug somebody else up, brought her back, skinned her, started wearing her clo wearing her skin, and then started killing women and wearing their skin first he started robbing graves and then cutting up them and turning their, their skin into furniture and all kinds of shit. And, but trans communities are complaining about this because the fact that he was a cross-dressing psychopath, it puts them in danger. A true story about a guy who was really into dressing up like women and wearing their skin. Like that puts them in danger. Like, you know, Netflix did a bad thing by talking about a real event that actually happened. A real fucking crazy person who's one of the worst serial killers in the history of this country.

It's you, you have, the one thing I will say about the UK in the UK's defense is that we looked, we have, I think we've turned the corner with this stuff. Well

You stopped the gender surgeries before anybody. Yes.

And And the puberty blockers and the puberty blockers,

Pub blockers. I meant gender surgery surgeries for

Young kids. Yeah. And that was as a result of the CAS report. Now the CAS report was conducted by a lady called Dr. Hillary Cass, who's one of the most prominent pediatricians in the uk. And it was an independent report funded by the conservative government at the time. But when she published that report, she was said there is no evidence, zero evidence that puberty blockers actually help or alleviate distress in children who say that they're gender dysphoric. So, and to be fair to the labor government at the time, the labor government, now they actually banned puberty blockers and whatever else. But you just go, why did we have to go through this process? Why did, oh look, we're finally, we're getting there. But this is something which we all know to be true apart from a small number of demented people.

You know what a puberty blocker initially was used for? Right.

No

Chemical castration. So same drugs they used to give sex offenders to chemically castrate.

Really?

Yeah. Same drugs.

Wow.

Yeah. And they just repurposed it and changed what they call it. You know, they deal with a lot of drugs. That's what they did with ivermectin. Same kind of thing. Yeah.

That's that's wild. And then it's really wild.

You wanna hear something even more wild.

Go

On. Michael Jackson's doctor claims that that's what his father did to him. And that completely makes sense to me because Michael Jackson, when he was young, had a fucking insane talent. Like insane. Hmm. He was so good. And his voice was so, and they were so huge and his father was so overbearing that I could imagine a world where he would decide like, what's the way to keep his voice the way it is? And you'd use puberty blockers. Make him a castrato basically. Exactly. Make him a castrato. Fuck. Yeah. And I think that's what they did. But that's what, if you look at his body, it shows no sign of testosterone. Right. He's just all limbs. Right. Whereas his brothers, you ever see his brothers? No. They're thick. They look like athletes. Like all of them look like thick men. And Michael is like a stick. Right. Right. And he always had that high pitched voice and he was always able to sing like a raa.",,simas,"Francis Foster is a comic and author of ""Classroom Confidential: The Truth About Being a Teacher and Why You Should Never Become One.""

"where they had to kill it because it was killing all these cows. And they had stumbled upon this one calve that had gotten right before they got to it. It eviscerated this calve and it, it was still alive and it had eaten some of its organs and they had to kill the calve. And then they're like hunting for this mountain lion and he has a video of him shooting this thing. Dogs chase it up a tree and then he shoots it with a bow and arrow. And then he had it stuffed here and he ate it.

Do you aim, you aim for the heart or the head?

Yeah. You aim for the heart and the lungs, whatever is available depending on the position of the mountain lion's arm. Right. Like if the arm is like right here, you wanna, you want to tuck it right behind the shoulder and you're gonna get double lungs. And if the arm is up here, you gonna either get the heart or the lungs depending on where their arm is or whether or not you have a, but that's powerful enough to go through the arm and into the body cavity.

Is there a risk, 'cause maybe this is like an urban myth, but if you hurt, hurt an animal, but you don't kill it, it will come back. Some of them will come back to fuck you up like a kind of revenge movie. No,

John Wick of animals.

Yeah. I imagine they just run away. They

Run away. Well, it's wild like deer that have survived with an arrow in their body cavity. There was a, a deer skeleton that they found of a deer that they, that someone a hunter killed eventually. And this thing had a arrow that had gone through its body and had turned all into bone. So bone had taken over this arrow and the, the whole ca, there it is. That's what it looked like. Wow.

Wow.

Isn't that crazy? Mm. So you could see the broadhead had embedded itself in one of the ribs. And so not only did the deer survive, but its body adapted and grew around the arrow.

Wow. Wow. Actually, the reason I said that about the nuts. That is insane about the animal was I know that COVID, particularly crows can remember. They can remember. Oh yeah. And then there's been instances where people have hurt crows and the crows phone away. And then a group of them have attacked the person.

Oh yeah. They're really smart. They're, they're super and ravens, I think that are, they're actually different than crows. And they're even smarter than crows. Do you know there's a parrot Who was that parrot? That brave parrot? Yeah. Who told us about that? Who was that the other day? Was that Palmer? Palmer Lucky? I think so. I think

So. Oh, is that the dude with the helmet? Yes. Holy shit. That helmet, bro.

Bro, that helmet's nuts. That helmet's nuts. This guy, that guy was, every now and then I get to sit down with someone and they start talking. I go, whoa, he, this guy's fucking crazy smart. Like weirdly smart. Like, oh, okay, I got it. I got it. Like, tell me what you're doing. And he was telling us about this parrot that actually would speak like a human toddler and new colors, new numbers. Could say things could and would communicate

African gray. Yeah, yeah. Yeah. African grays. They have a, they, they can have the IQ of a 4-year-old child. That

Is nuts. Yeah. When you see this thing talking, you're like, yeah.

And their imitation of sounds is like

Perfect. Dead

On. Yeah. Dead on. Yeah.

But you have to be around them all the time.

Right, right, right. You

Have a twin that you gotta take with you everywhere you go. Yeah.

Really? Because they just get pulled and fuck, fuck. You can fuck shit up.

And then they, they're too smart. They actually start like chopping their own wings off and shit like that. Yeah. They get depressed because they don get stimulation depress, they get depressed. They really need a lot of stimulation. Really? Yeah. They're like humans. I thought about owning app para, but I just traveled too much. Yeah. You

Don't know. You don't want that in your life. That's too much work.

It's, it's a commitment. Yeah. If

You leave it alone, it would be sad too. Yeah.

But that's what I'm saying. Yeah. They

Get mad. I had a buddy of mine who had a parrot and when he would leave it, he would come home and start screaming, where the fuck were you? Like, he wasn't really saying that, but it was like, that was what it was saying. Yeah. It was, was screaming.

Why get married when you've got that? Right.

Yeah. And then he had to, upon coming home, immediately take it out and take it out and like put it on his shoulder. Right. Or put it in his hand. And if you put it down for a second it would start getting pissed off. It's crazy. I'm like, dude, he goes, I know it's a lot. He goes, I didn't think it was gonna be this much. It was like, it was a lot of work. Yeah.

Joe, I'm not, hope I'm not being polite. Have you got any of those cigars where all we smoke? I would love a cigar.

Let's go baby.

It's a weird thing to ask to be. These are really good. I should have said, if you offer us a cigar, we'll accept one. Come on man.

Please. Thanks, brother. We have a big ass humid door. There is a, oh, I

Didn't bring my light out

Over there. Some here. Right here.

Oh, bonobo chimps are very interesting like that as well.

They're the weirdest, right? Because they just fuck all the time. This might, might need some juice. Let me give you a little juice.

Go

For it. They're weird because it's like, okay, so chimps can be either hippies or they can be, you know, like the worst barbarians in human history. Well, it's

Like us.

Just like us. Yeah. That's what's weird. 'cause like, but also the bonobos, like they don't have any, they have one rule. The rule is the mom won't fuck the son. That's it. It's

A good rule. So yeah. It's a good fucking rule man. But they're a

Bunch of sister fuckers. They're a bunch of sister fuckers and daughter fuckers. Yeah.

But they're not motherfuckers. They're

Probably dad fuckers too. They're probably fucking, they're probably doing gay sex too. They, they, they seem wild. They're just having a good time. But

They, so they're homophobic.

No, not at all. And they solve all their problems with that. Do

You need to cut these ones? Yeah. How do

You It opens like a door.

Oh, alright.

Right here. And then you pull those.

But you know they can learn sign language. Oh yeah.

You know what's interesting though? They don't ask questions.

So they're like men. Ah.

But the parrot did.

The parrot did. Yeah.

The parrot asked questions. The parrot had some questions about how things work.

The African grays are incredibly intelligent. Yeah. Incredibly intelligent.

Well, what I'm interested in is what happens when we can start really decoding dolphin language with ai. Right. And once they really understand what they're saying, then things are gonna get very strange.

Light it. And

You know, because like, what are they, did they, I mean they're really smart, like silly smart. Like dolphins have enormous frontal lobes.

Oh yeah. Man. And communication. They

Have dialects. They have,

They have dialects. Yeah.

They sound different. Different

Parts of the world. That makes sense. I mean that makes sense. Right? The different, slightly different.

Well, on that note, you think, what about whales? Yeah. Whales brains are literally bigger than us. Yeah. They're, they're enormous. So if we're talking about brain size equals I, which I'm

It's brain size relative to body master. Yeah.

Oh is it? Yeah.

Yeah. Because you need a big fucking brain to run a big body. Yeah. Right,

Right. Which is also the argument for why the Neanderthals might have been dumber than us.

Well they were from

What we think. They don't know that though. Really? Yeah. They had pretty big brains. What's weird about them is they also had language. Yeah. They had writing and or they had, they definitely had tool making. They had

Writing Don't, I don't think they had

Writing. Writing. No, they didn't have writing. They had language. But they, they did do art. That's what it is. Mm. Wasn't writing necessarily, but they drew stuff and they had a brain that's bigger than ours. But they were also like jacked. They had bigger eyeballs. There was a guy that, this was a, there was a crazy theory that I'm sure is horseshit, but it was cool. Like he made Neanderthals look way different. This guy had a theory like, 'cause we're just, we've never seen a live neanderthal. And he was like, what if we are getting it totally wrong? And what if they were more gorilla looking

Than, but we have the skulls and skeletons down

There. We have some stuff and they also think they have red hair. This guy was, it's a cracked theory. Right, right. But it was a fun theory. But one of the more fun aspects of this guy's crack theory was that their eyeballs are so much bigger than ours. Their sockets are really big. He's like, what if they have night vision like a deer or like a wolf, you know? Which is totally possible for a primate to have. It's not like, it's not like there's anything about being that kind of a mammal that would exclude you from being able to develop night vision eyesight. Are

There, are there primates that have that?

I don't

Know because there's mammals for sure. Yeah.

But what, yeah, let's ask, let's ask perplexity. Perplexity.

Is

There any, what is that called? When they have night vision when animals are nocturnal and they could see well at night, you know that thing that like when you're driving and you're see

A fox or something? Yeah,

Yeah, yeah. The reflective eyes that they all have. Yeah.

Yeah. What is that? I don't, what's

That called? I dunno. I dunno.

We should know.

Do you know there's a very interesting theory about ne neanderthals and homo sapiens is there are some people who think that we are one of the few species or one of the only species that has a capacity to deceive Oh and trick. So there was, there's a, there's a theory going around that, that

The monkeys do that monkeys trick other monkeys into thinking there's an eagle coming. So they steal fruit. Do

They? Yeah. That's interesting.

They yell out the sound for eagle and then all the monkeys run away and then they steal the fruit.

Oh really? Yeah. Wow.

So here it is. Monkey primates, the tarsier and the night monkey al monkey are the species with the best vision adapted to night conditions. Right. Okay. So they do. Yeah. See, look at that largest eyes relative to body size of any mammal. So it's something about having a large eye. Because if you, okay. So despite lacking a tape, ofum lucidum, the reflective layer that cause eye shine in many nocturnal animals. Oh, that's what that is. The retina is containing extremely high density of rod photoreceptors, which are highly sensitive to dim light. This allows tarsiers to detect and track prey such as insects in near darkness. And they can see in light as low as 0.001 lux. Similar to moonless nights. Damn. So there's a bunch of different little primates. Oh,

Lori's.

But why, I mean, if you were living in a time, especially if you didn't have fire, if you're living in a time where, you know, there's no roofs, like you're, you're, you're hunting, you're outside at night, you're probably spending as much time as you can hunting. 'cause Neanderthals weren't gatherers, they weren't farmers. So all they did was hunt. Mm. So they probably had some sort of night vision, which would've wild.

Yeah. The thing that I find interesting is what is there, I think there's certain, the average person in Europe has around 3% Neanderthal,

DNAD,

NAD three, 3% a if you are African zero. Right. So it's, it's just really interesting. And you see some people, and they're more, they kind of have more than neanderthal kind of appearance too.

Yeah, for sure.

And then other people. And you go, what, what does that actually give you that 3%? What does it do? Is there any discernible difference whatsoever? Does it make you perhaps more athletic, more re more resilient?

It's a good question. I mean, I think it would depend. I mean there's also a bunch of other weird strains of human that existed that there, you know, like Dennis Ovs and there's, there's quite a few other ones. Yeah,

Yeah.

Yeah. You know, who knows what if, I think the Dennis Ovs, I think they definitely got into the gene pool too. I forget who they were saying had a high levels of Dennis Ov DNA, it might have been aboriginal Australians. Hmm. But you know, there's, there was a bunch of different types of human, you know, we just figured out how to be the kiest and the most conniving. And I think probably the most clever,

Well, harra, have you read the Sapiens? His thesis is we, we worked out how to work together beyond the 150 done by number. That was his, his idea is basically we created these shared myths. Religion, money, whatever nation, all of the stuff that we all agree is real that, you know, it feels real. Right. But we, the reason we out-competed other species is that we could cooperate across beyond our immediate tribal group. And that's the reason. That

Makes sense. That makes sense. I mean, there's also, human beings have a very distinct desire to make better things all the time. And if you have that and you're applying that to weapons, you're gonna make the best weapons. Right. You know, I don't know if Neanderthals had that. You know, did they have, I mean, if you're gonna make stuff, right? If you're gonna make tools, you must have some creativity and some desire to innovate. And

Curiosity.

Yeah. Curiosity, desire to innovate. 'cause we know that, look, there's certain animals that will use weapons. Right. There's certain, like there's a, a famous photograph of an orangutan that's spearfishing. Have you ever seen that? Yeah. Photo. Mm. But it learned how to do it from people and you know, they'll use rocks to break open crabs and they'll do stuff like that. But they're not fastening an arrowhead No. On a stick or a spear. And they're making it with flint. The inter halls did that. So they got to a level where they're like, okay, this is like craftsmanship. Like this is sophisticated craftsmanship. And it would also probably indicate some sort of a complex language that you could explain where you get the, the gut that you turn into fiber that you use to tie the arrowhead to the stick. Like they were, they were doing, they was doing some high level stuff. Yeah.

For,

Sorry,

Go ahead. For a primate.

Yeah. I would imagine also a lot of the innovation comes once you have the greater revolution because there's now surplus food. Yeah. And so you can afford to have a bunch of guys sitting around, not hunting, but like thinking about shit or inventing things or you know, making things in a different way. You know?

Did you see that discovery of a skull that was 500,000 years older than they thought was the origin of human beings? So that it potentially pushes back the original homosapiens to 500,000 years? No.

Earlier.

Is that real? Yeah.

Yeah. They think it's, it might push back the date. I mean it's an under debate I'm sure. But I think they might push back the date of the rival of homo sapiens to a million years.

Wow.

Yeah.

But it just shows, you know, it's nuts. How,

This is just nuts.

How little do we know about ancient civilization? Stonehenge in the uk, which is this iconic, you know? Have

You been

No, I haven't. No, you

You should go. It's

Really special energy

There, man. Yeah. It's really impressive. And like Constance said, there's a special energy and it's, it's a profoundly moving place. When you visit it, you feel as if you have a connection to something else. It's like going to the pyramids. But they have no idea. They have a rough idea of where the stones might have come from, but they've got no idea how they got there. How they erected them. Yeah.

Who you should go man. Joe Rogan arrested a heath airport. That would be a great fucking story. Boy,

I'm sure they can find some tweets

For us
