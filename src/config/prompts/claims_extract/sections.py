GROUPING_SECTION = """─────────────────────────────────────────────
EXTRACTION MODE: GROUPED BY TOPIC
─────────────────────────────────────────────

A topic list for this material is provided under INPUTS. Iterate through the
topics in the order given and extract the claims that belong to each.

- Set each claim's `topic` to the label of the topic it belongs to.
- Aim for 2-5 claims per topic. If a topic yields fewer than 2 claims after a
  thorough scan, that is an extraction problem first — re-scan the documents
  before deciding the topic is under-supported.
- If a fact clearly belongs in the output but fits no topic exactly, assign
  it to the NEAREST existing topic — a loose fit is the correct standard. If
  no topic is even loosely related, relabel one existing topic one level
  broader so the orphan fact has a home, and use the relabeled name as that
  claim's `topic`.
- After extracting claims, assemble `groups`: one group per topic that has at
  least 2 claims, in topic order. Each group carries the topic label as its
  `name`, an optional one-sentence `summary`, and the `claim_indices` of its
  member claims. Fold a topic with a single claim into the nearest related
  group instead of emitting a one-claim group. Never pad a group with a
  restatement of a fact already claimed.

CRITICAL — claim_index discipline:
1. Finalize the claims array first. Lock the order.
2. Number each claim by its 0-based position.
3. Build all groups (and quotes, if requested) referencing those positions.
4. INDEX RECONCILIATION: for each group, read back the claim at every index
   in claim_indices and confirm it belongs. Fix mismatches before output."""


FLAT_SECTION = """─────────────────────────────────────────────
EXTRACTION MODE: FLAT
─────────────────────────────────────────────

Extract claims in a single dense pass, in the order the material presents
them.

- Leave every claim's `topic` empty and output an empty `groups` array.
- Coverage sweep: walk each document section by section from start to finish.
  For every substantive passage, ask: "Does at least one of my claims carry a
  fact from this passage?" If a passage contains any substantive fact and no
  claim covers it, extract it before finishing. No substantive passage may be
  entirely unrepresented."""


QUOTES_SECTION = """─────────────────────────────────────────────
QUOTE EXTRACTION (REQUESTED)
─────────────────────────────────────────────

Extract verbatim quotes from the documents that support specific claims.

- Each quote must be verbatim from the document text, and must not extend
  past a truncation marker ("…", "[…]", "[&#8230;]"). If the quoted speech is
  cut off, shorten to where the text verifiably ends or skip the quote.
- Set `speaker` to the named speaker when identifiable — exactly as the
  document gives the name; never complete a truncated name. For speaker-
  labeled transcripts, the label before the passage is the speaker.
- Attach each quote to exactly one `claim_index` (the claim it most directly
  supports), and set `document_index` to the 0-based index of the document it
  came from.
- Most material with direct speech should yield 1-4 quotes; return zero
  quotes only when no document contains quotable direct speech."""


SUMMARY_SECTION = """─────────────────────────────────────────────
NARRATIVE SUMMARY (REQUESTED)
─────────────────────────────────────────────

Generate a 350-500 character narrative summary in the `summary` field:
- Third person, present tense; one dense paragraph, no bullet points.
- Include specific numbers, names, and facts; capture tensions or competing
  positions when present.
- Use evidence-appropriate language matching the strength of the material.
- Summary-claims parity: the summary may not assert any specific fact that no
  claim covers. Promote the fact to a claim or remove it from the summary."""


FACTUALITY_SECTION = """─────────────────────────────────────────────
FACTUALITY CLASSIFICATION (REQUESTED)
─────────────────────────────────────────────

For every claim, set `is_factual`. The flag decides how readers engage with
the claim: a factual claim is verified or disputed against a source; a
non-factual claim is agreed or disagreed with. Ask what KIND of assertion the
claim makes — not whether it is true, and not whether you happen to know the
answer.

true — the claim asserts ONE specific thing a source could settle: a named
actor doing a named thing, a dated event, a quantity or measurement, a
location, a named study's finding, or an on-record statement by a named
person. You do not need to know whether it is correct: a specific claim that
turns out to be false is still factual.
- "The WHO declared the DRC Ebola outbreak a public health emergency on
  May 1, 2026." (dated event)
- "A 2023 University of Exeter study of 450,000 participants found morning
  types had a lower risk of depression." (named study, sample, finding)
- "Sam Altman expects an internal OpenAI system he would call AGI by end of
  2026." (on-record statement by a named person)

false — the claim has no single specific thing a source could settle:
- evaluations and appraisals of magnitude: "key," "significant,"
  "insufficient," "too," "overly," "not enough," "risky," "better"
- prescriptions and policy positions: "should," "must," "ought to"
- interpretations, characterizations, and causal theses with no named study
- generalizations with no specific referent: "many people," "most,"
  "often," "some," "not everyone"
- hedged statements: "may," "might," "can," "could," "tends to"
- forecasts and predictions
- definitional or descriptive statements with nothing to verify
- the material's central proposition and each side's stance on it
- statements about the argument itself: who bears the burden of proof, what
  has or has not been demonstrated, whether it is premature to conclude

Tie-breakers:
- Classify the content, never the act of saying it. "X argued Y" is not
  factual because X said it — classify Y.
- The main predicate decides. A value word (effective, better, key,
  dangerous, worth it) makes the claim false even when its subject is
  concrete. A modal softener ("can be," "tends to be") does not rescue a
  claim into specificity — it removes it.
- An evaluation wrapped around a specific fact splits when the split test
  allows: extract the specific fact as its own claim.
- Both labels will occur; classify each claim on its own terms and do not
  aim for any balance. Most claims drawn from argument — debates, opinion
  pieces, interviews — are false under this rule, and that is expected.

The bar is deliberately asymmetric: a missing flag costs one unverified
claim, a wrong flag sends readers to verify something no source can settle.
When a claim genuinely sits between the two — it names something specific
but wraps it in an appraisal — choose false.

Classify each claim as written, without adding or removing hedging. When this
section is present, every claim must carry an explicit true or false — never
leave `is_factual` null."""


CONTESTABILITY_SECTION = """─────────────────────────────────────────────
CONTESTABILITY CLASSIFICATION (REQUESTED)
─────────────────────────────────────────────

For every claim, set `is_contestable`. This classifies the SCOPE of the
claim's main assertion — not whether it is true, and not whether anyone is
currently arguing about it. A claim can be both factual and contestable; the
two flags are independent.

true — a broad, contestable claim whose central assertion supports
substantive positions for and against it, rather than being resolved through
direct verification of one narrowly scoped fact. It may express a policy
judgment, comparison, interpretation, causal thesis, normative position, or
broad forecast.

false — the claim's main assertion is settled by directly verifying one
narrowly scoped fact.

Rules:
1. Judge the MAIN assertion. Concrete anchors, examples or figures attached
   to a broad claim do not narrow it: "The US has historically used inflation
   to manage debt, such as after WWII" is contestable.
2. Naming companies, products or people does not make a claim narrow; scope
   decides: "OpenAI and Anthropic are the main competitors in frontier AI" is
   contestable.
3. Comparative-superiority stances ("X is better than Y", "X is the main
   competitor to Y") are contestable. A factual comparison of named entities
   on a checkable attribute (regulatory status, features, dates) is not.
4. Unattributed economy-wide or market-wide forecasts with no specific
   market, instrument or figure ("a recession is likely next year") are
   contestable. A forecast about one specific market, asset or event is not.
5. Advice, and "an indicator to watch for", state no checkable fact, so they
   are contestable.

Worked examples — true (broad enough to hold two sides):
- "Entitlement spending in the United States is not economically sustainable."
- "Bitcoin is a better store of value than gold." (comparative superiority)
- "Placing patient care in the hands of automated systems at their current
  stage is risky." (appraisal of risk)
- "The design of engagement-maximizing products removes friction that people
  need." (causal thesis)

Worked examples — false (one narrowly scoped fact settles them):
- "There have been cases where an automated assistant gave a user unsafe
  instructions." (a single documented case settles it)
- "Tim Cook reportedly wakes up at 4 a.m." (one attributed detail)
- "Coinbase is registered with the SEC as a broker-dealer and Kraken is not."
  (comparison on a checkable attribute — rule 3)
- "Specialized assistants for this purpose already exist." (bare existence)

A hedge does not decide this flag either way: "X may cause Y" can be a broad
causal thesis (contestable) or a narrow guess about one event (not). Judge the
scope of what is being asserted, not the confidence it is asserted with."""


CONSOLIDATION_SECTION = """─────────────────────────────────────────────
CROSS-DOCUMENT CONSOLIDATION
─────────────────────────────────────────────

The input contains multiple documents.

- Identify claims that assert the same fact in different phrasings across
  documents. Keep ONE — the most specific, complete version — and record ALL
  supporting document indices in `document_indices`.
- Drop near-duplicate phrasings.
- Claims supported by multiple documents are higher-evidence; single-document
  claims are acceptable when the document is authoritative for that fact."""
