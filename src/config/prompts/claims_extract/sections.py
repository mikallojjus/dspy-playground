GROUPING_SECTION = """─────────────────────────────────────────────
EXTRACTION MODE: GROUPED BY TOPIC
─────────────────────────────────────────────

A topic list for this material is provided under INPUTS. Iterate through the
topics in the order given and extract the claims that belong to each.

- Set each claim's `topic` to the label of the topic it belongs to.
- Aim for 2-5 claims per topic. If a topic yields fewer than 2 claims after a
  thorough scan, that is an extraction problem first — re-scan the documents
  before deciding the topic is under-supported.
- If a fact clearly belongs in the output but fits no topic exactly, assign
  it to the NEAREST existing topic — a loose fit is the correct standard. If
  no topic is even loosely related, relabel one existing topic one level
  broader so the orphan fact has a home, and use the relabeled name as that
  claim's `topic`.
- After extracting claims, assemble `groups`: one group per topic that has at
  least 2 claims, in topic order. Each group carries the topic label as its
  `name`, an optional one-sentence `summary`, and the `claim_indices` of its
  member claims. Fold a topic with a single claim into the nearest related
  group instead of emitting a one-claim group. Never pad a group with a
  restatement of a fact already claimed.

CRITICAL — claim_index discipline:
1. Finalize the claims array first. Lock the order.
2. Number each claim by its 0-based position.
3. Build all groups (and quotes, if requested) referencing those positions.
4. INDEX RECONCILIATION: for each group, read back the claim at every index
   in claim_indices and confirm it belongs. Fix mismatches before output."""


FLAT_SECTION = """─────────────────────────────────────────────
EXTRACTION MODE: FLAT
─────────────────────────────────────────────

Extract claims in a single dense pass, in the order the material presents
them.

- Leave every claim's `topic` empty and output an empty `groups` array.
- Coverage sweep: walk each document section by section from start to finish.
  For every substantive passage, ask: "Does at least one of my claims carry a
  fact from this passage?" If a passage contains any substantive fact and no
  claim covers it, extract it before finishing. No substantive passage may be
  entirely unrepresented."""


QUOTES_SECTION = """─────────────────────────────────────────────
QUOTE EXTRACTION (REQUESTED)
─────────────────────────────────────────────

Extract verbatim quotes from the documents that support specific claims.

- Each quote must be verbatim from the document text, and must not extend
  past a truncation marker ("…", "[…]", "[&#8230;]"). If the quoted speech is
  cut off, shorten to where the text verifiably ends or skip the quote.
- Set `speaker` to the named speaker when identifiable — exactly as the
  document gives the name; never complete a truncated name. For speaker-
  labeled transcripts, the label before the passage is the speaker.
- Attach each quote to exactly one `claim_index` (the claim it most directly
  supports), and set `document_index` to the 0-based index of the document it
  came from.
- Most material with direct speech should yield 1-4 quotes; return zero
  quotes only when no document contains quotable direct speech."""


SUMMARY_SECTION = """─────────────────────────────────────────────
NARRATIVE SUMMARY (REQUESTED)
─────────────────────────────────────────────

Generate a 350-500 character narrative summary in the `summary` field:
- Third person, present tense; one dense paragraph, no bullet points.
- Include specific numbers, names, and facts; capture tensions or competing
  positions when present.
- Use evidence-appropriate language matching the strength of the material.
- Summary-claims parity: the summary may not assert any specific fact that no
  claim covers. Promote the fact to a claim or remove it from the summary."""


FACTUALITY_SECTION = """─────────────────────────────────────────────
FACTUALITY CLASSIFICATION (REQUESTED)
─────────────────────────────────────────────

For every claim, set `is_factual`. The flag decides how readers engage with
the claim: a factual claim is verified or disputed against evidence; a
non-factual claim is agreed or disagreed with. The question is about the
KIND of proposition — never about who said it or how confidently:

"Is this a statement about how the world is, was, or works — something
evidence could in principle confirm or refute — or is it a judgement of
value, a prescription, a forecast, or a side in the argument?"

true — empirical propositions, whether or not they are correct, hedged, or
stated from memory by a speaker or author:
- events, actions, and decisions, dated or named ("The WHO declared the
  DRC Ebola outbreak a public health emergency on May 1, 2026")
- quantities, measurements, statistics, prices, dates
- mechanisms, causes, and regularities about the world ("Forcing an
  evening chronotype to wake at 5 a.m. causes social jetlag," "Chronotype
  is largely genetic," "Sunlight exposure can cause skin cancer")
- what exists, is available, or is used ("People in Norway use lamps that
  brighten gradually to mimic sunrise")
- cited studies, rulings, documents, and official statements, with the
  finding they report
- hedged or contested empirical hypotheses ("Night owl behavior may be
  caused by overwork rather than being an innate trait") — a hedge lowers
  confidence; it does not change the kind of proposition

false — propositions evidence cannot settle:
- evaluations and value judgements: "key," "better," "effective,"
  "dangerous," "toxic," "good for the soul," "the main thing"
- degree judgements: "too," "overly," "not enough," "simplistic," "more
  dangerous than useful"
- prescriptions and policy positions: "should," "must," "ought to,"
  "deserve"
- forecasts about the future
- the material's central proposition — a debate motion, an op-ed's thesis,
  an episode's overarching argument — and each side's stance on it ("Waking
  with the sun, not simply waking early, is what improves health," "AI
  chatbots are an effective tool for mental health support")
- generalizations whose content is an appraisal rather than a mechanism
  ("Human therapists are limited," "AI is too simplistic")
- statements about the argument itself: who bears the burden of proof,
  what has or has not been demonstrated, whether it is premature to
  conclude

Tie-breakers:
- Classify the content, never the act of saying it. "X argued Y" is not
  factual because X said it — classify Y.
- The main predicate decides. If it is a value word (effective, better,
  key, dangerous, worth it, too much), the claim is false even when its
  subject is concrete. If it describes a state, event, mechanism, or
  quantity, the claim is true even when the speaker is arguing for a
  position. A modal or frequency softener ("can be," "tends to be," "is
  often") does not change the kind: "can be overly agreeable" is still a
  degree judgement.
- An evaluation wrapped around a mechanism splits when the split test
  allows: "Sunlight is good for you because it provides vitamin D" is an
  appraisal (false) around a mechanism (true) — extract the mechanism as
  its own claim.
- Expect a mix. Debates, opinion pieces, interviews, and talks usually
  yield both kinds; a run where nearly every claim is one kind is a sign of
  misfiling — re-check.

Classify each claim as written, without adding hedging. When this section is
present, every claim must carry an explicit true or false — never leave
`is_factual` null."""


CONSOLIDATION_SECTION = """─────────────────────────────────────────────
CROSS-DOCUMENT CONSOLIDATION
─────────────────────────────────────────────

The input contains multiple documents.

- Identify claims that assert the same fact in different phrasings across
  documents. Keep ONE — the most specific, complete version — and record ALL
  supporting document indices in `document_indices`.
- Drop near-duplicate phrasings.
- Claims supported by multiple documents are higher-evidence; single-document
  claims are acceptable when the document is authoritative for that fact."""
