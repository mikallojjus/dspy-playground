"""Schemas for the standalone debate task (news.extract_debate_claims).

Split out of news.extract_topics_and_claims so debate never sits on the fused
task's critical path: the injector needs claims fast (an editor is waiting)
and collects debates asynchronously, while the cron pipeline simply awaits the
two tasks in sequence. The consumer passes back the claims the fused task
returned — generation grounds candidates in them and the semantic review
judges against them — so this task adds no extraction of its own.
