"""
Episode query service for CLI processing.

Handles database queries to find episodes to process, with filtering
for already-processed episodes and podcast selection.

Usage:
    from src.cli.episode_query import EpisodeQueryService

    service = EpisodeQueryService()
    episodes = service.get_episodes_to_process(
        podcast_id=123,
        limit=10,
        force=False
    )
