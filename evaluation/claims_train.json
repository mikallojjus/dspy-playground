      "transcript_chunk": "piration to O'Connell would be an understatement. Not just how Edison succeeded, but how he talked about failure.\n\nI had heard that phrase, I have not failed 10,000 times. I have successfully found 10,000 ways not to build the light bulb. And of course, that led to the success.\n\nToday, O'Connell and his studio build public art projects across the country. Some of them are complicated pieces with big moving parts. He has won awards. His work is in museums. But O'Connell says the projects he remembers best are the ones that don't work out. His biggest failure was in Houston. It's a massive piece made of aluminum and stainless steel and fabric. It's called wings over water.\n\nWe won the commission in the spring of 2016, and it had to be installed in downtown Houston in time for Super Bowl 51, which was February, 2017. And it was going to be what's, by some measures, the world's largest freestanding outdoor kinetic sculpture in an active fountain. And it all had to be done in a few months. Houston is a city of immigration and migration. It's the number one city from which people coming from south and Central America get their first foothold in the United States. They have an economy that is welcoming.\n\nThey have established communities. It's also an extremely welcoming city to bird migration. Houston and the Gulf of Mexico. Houston interface is where birds on the Central American Flyway stop after they've flown over the Gulf. And so the concept for this art is to give tribute to when a bird or a human is in a difficult spot and doesn't have a place to land and rest, they just have to fly days and days without rest. So the idea was this giant set of wings that has this sine wave that moves through it along two axes, and the wings are continuously beating over the fountain wings, over water, if you will, in an effort to be completely, metaphorically true to Houston.\n\nIt is moved by a large hydraulic motor that turns a crankshaft. And the wings are supported by, I think it's 32 push rods that look like oil derricks rising and falling. So the things were installed, it ran for the Super Bowl. People love it. It's the backdrop for countless social media photos. And in the Super Bowl between plays, there's some footage of it. Then three things happened. We had Hurricane Harvey, which hit Houston, but didn't damage the sculpture. It was a pretty mild impact on the actual downtown we had planned for hurricanes.\n\nIt also went through Covid during a period of time when we know that the plaza was not policed, and we'd heard that kids were kind of getting in the fountain and messing around. In any event, COVID iss over we're reopening to the public and the sculpture's operating. What got us was we were not prepared for the big Texas freeze for one to two weeks. The temperature was around 10 20 degrees, and pipes froze and broke all over Houston. So the main helix that drives wings over water is itself a pipe. And as it dips in and out of the fountain, it accumulates water.\n\nAnd we had never anticip. We had gotten environmental data and we had anticipated an ice storm coating the sculpture, and we did the calculations for that. But nothing in our assumptions led us to calculate two weeks of how much water expands when it gets down well below 20 degrees. So it went through the ice storm and there was no visible damage. And then cracks started to develop in one part of the helix. So the first thing we do is we immobilize it, we replace that part with an identical part, and then right next to it, additional cracks developed.\n\nSo we stopped operating. And again, and what they decided to do as of last November was to say, you know, I think we're just gonna leave the sculpture off as a static sculpture, And that's the current position. And so we took that, well, it's theirs. You know, we took that judgment a little harshly. It's the feeling you get when you've prepared for problems A, B, C, D, E, and F, and something like G or M comes out of the blue and smacks you. We had spent so much time worrying about what would happen if there was a hurricane. You know, what if somebody got hurt building it?\n\nNobody ever got hurt building it. And the sculpture eventually made it through Hurricane Harvey. But I think this particular incident highlights one of the problems with projects and complexity. It would probably take a million dollars to totally redo the bottom part of wings over water. And I still hold out the thought that that would be a wonderful future. Second act for wings over water if just a relatively small amount of money by municipal standards could be raised. I will tell you one thing about Edison. He wasn't driven by money. He was passionate about inventing the next thing. He was driven by the beauty of the things he was making.\n\nAnd I feel like I have that too. And that sets you up for disappointment, for failure. 'cause you can't stop investing in what you're doing.\n\nThere's one more zone of failure that we haven't heard about today. It's love.\n\nNobody gets outta love alive, nobody. We all know that. But we go on.\n\nHelen Fisher was a friend of mine, a lovely human. She died last year. She was an anthropologist who studied romantic love.\n\nI have been extremely lucky during most of my life. I've lived with men long-term, two men, long-term, one for 15 years, another for 18 years. Oddly enough, I've studied marriage for 50 years, but I wasn't interested in marrying. I finally met the man of my dreams. I just nuts about him. He is a very well known journalist, and he had interviewed me for years and, and I really liked him. And we went. We went out for about six months, and then he dumped me. Yeah, he dumped me when I was 70. I was never angry at him. The reason I wasn't angry at him is he was a single father going through a horrible divorce.\n\nHe just came to me one day and he said, Helen, I just can't take on anymore. I remember he did it in Grand Central Station, and I was standing there and I said, okay. And I remember I walked home and I just sat at the edge of my bed for six weeks playing music to kill yourself by and crying. I mean, what else do you do? And you know, overloading my friends with my sorrow and all that, which by the way, after a while isn't a good idea. You're just raising the ghost. But anyway, what I did though is I never contacted him. I never wrote him at Christmas to wish him well. I never contacted him again.\n\nI think it allowed him to realize that he was a free agent, that he could start this relationship and explore where it was gonna go without having a tightrope around his neck. So he wrote to me a letter and said to me that he thought he'd made a terrible mistake and we fell in love and we got, I got married to him at age 75. When he asked me to marry him. I said, I'll marry you, but I'm not moving in because I have a little nice apartment in New York. He's got a beautiful apartment in the Bronx. But I mean, I'm there five nights a week. The other nights I like to go to the theater with my girlfriends, et cetera.\n\nIf Helen Fisher is to be believed, the difference between success and failure is sometimes just timing. Time, after all is the dimension of change. It isn't hard to think of success and failure as nearly identical as twins, even separated by nothing but a few moments. This is what Travis Thul came to believe, fo you will remember, is the inventor of the ramen. Now,\n\nThe feedback we received consistently was, this is great. This is awesome. We'll sell millions. We just need you to pony up two or $300,000 up front.\n\nAfter he spoke with us about his failed invention, he started thinking maybe he shouldn't have given up. He still doesn't have the two or $300,000, but he did think of a way to raise it with a campaign on Kickstarter, the crowdfunding platform. So we got back on the line with Travis doll.\n\nYeah, so the proposal to give this one last rodeo on Kickstarter seemed really intuitive. I hired a marketing team. I hired a graphic designer, hired a mechanical engineer, a couple other folks that have helped put together the social media presence, build the webpage, build out some more three-dimensional renders. Of course, we've done the prototyping and the experimentation. So really, I think putting ourselves in a position where if Kickstarter has the interest that we hope it will, we might be able to get a good product to some early adopters in the not too distant future.\n\nWhat do you think your chance of success is?\n\nThis whole conversation started out of failing gloriously, right? There was a point 10 years ago where I thought, how on earth could this fail? This is such a simple concept with a huge audience, right? This is literally the coffee maker for ramen noodles, which everybody eats. And of course, we were not successful the first rodeo, so I, I want temporary expectations. I would be happy to be surprised.\n\nWould you put your odds at maybe 50 50 at least, or no?\n\nOh my, maybe there's a 10% chance that we raised that $300,000. I think that's probably just being an engineer. I think that's the more statistically relevant reality. But I think, you know, maybe the Hope Springs eternal and all of us failed and successful entrepreneurs that, you know, we get that visibility and there's somebody out there and says, you know what? This has a potential George Foreman grill style market. Why don't we give this a go? Given that the investment is relatively small, given the market size.\n\nIf there was a celebrity to link to the Ramen now, who would it be?\n\nOh, man. So I'm out of touch with pop culture like I was. Who can we get the kid that played Chunk from the Goonies? I feel like that would be a great voice for my generation. Aaron Rogers. He's very popular, I guess in New York, which would be a great place to go. Tom Brady, he's still around. Presumably we could go with him.\n\nWhat if you go upstream a little bit like Barack Obama might be interested and he's not that busy.\n\nYeah. Barack Obama did a very good episode with Anthony Bourdain, where they were eating noodles in Vietnam. Barack Obama eating Ramen outta my ramen maker would be, I guess I could call it a day at that point. I think the Obama now could be a potential kitchen appliance.\n\nSo the last time we spoke, you said, here's a quote from you, Travis. There's nothing more that I would like to see in my lifetime than the successful launching and widespread adoption of ramen. Now, I was looking back over that transcript and I was thinking like, really, there's nothing more you'd like to see? You have a family and there's cancer and climate change. How do all those challenges, let's say, compare to the problem of instant ramen?\n\nWell, you know, if you can't enjoy your ramen the way you want to when you want to, what's the point of it all? What else is there?\n\nWell played, sir. Well played\n\nWorld peace is very important, but I wanna assure that when we have that peaceful world, everybody in it can eat ramen. Now,\n\nI hope you enjoyed this episode and we've got an update for you on Travis th and the Ramen. Now, his Kickstarter campaign raised only $54,000, a long way from his goal of $277,000. That might sound like another failure, but the story did not end there. After this episode aired in 20 23, 2 listeners reached out to Thul to learn more about Ramen. Now, they were both entrepreneurs who liked the idea and wanted to help him get it off the ground, and that's how Ramen now finally found its lead investor, MOA Hila, the CEO of a Denver contracting company. Thul says he hopes we will see the Ramen now on store shelves by next spring.\n\nComing up next time on the show, the fourth and final episode in our series, How to Succeed at Failing. Here's a question. If there's so much to learn from failure, why is no one teaching it? I'm\n\nGonna do this experimental class and I'm gonna call it Failure one oh one,\n\nAnd how would you feel about a Museum of Failure?\n\nWe have Pepsi, crystal New Coke. We have the Thoran Blood Testing Kit.\n\nAlso, you've heard of a post-mortem when things go wrong. How about a pre-mortem? That's next time on the show.

He graduated summa cum laude and he was the student speaker at his own graduation. He started work on his PhD at the University of Chicago's Committee on Social thought, but he returned to Rutgers to finish it. His thesis was called The Odyssey of Political Theory, which he turned into his first book. It examined how Homer's Odyssey spoke to issues like departure and return, and whether our contemporary culture wars are driven by reality or just what some people might call mood affiliation. His thesis advisor was Wilson Carey McWilliams, a well-regarded political scientist.\n\nWilson Ker McWilliams was a great and ardent New Deal Democrat. He was a profound influence in my life.\n\nMcWilliams was perhaps best known for studying morality in politics, and you can hear Mc Williams's voice in some of Patrick Deen's writing. Deen's journey through academia has been a bit of an odyssey itself. His first teaching job was at Princeton\n\nAs an assistant professor. We were assigned a large number of senior thesis to advise 15 to 20. Each of these were about a hundred pages in many cases. They weren't students you'd worked with before or had classes with you.\n\nThat was a case with a Princeton undergraduate named Pete Hegseth, who today is the Secretary of Defense.\n\nSo I didn't know him when he stepped into my office, other than the fact that I was a pretty ferocious Princeton basketball fan. I took our young sons to a lot of those games. It was a great team to watch because it was that old Pete Carll, his system, the Princeton system, great offense to watch. Really, really fun. This\n\nWas a system that went back to Bill Bradley, wasn't it? Oh\n\nYeah. And it was designed for a team that was maybe not as athletically talented as some of the other teams. No shade on Bill Bradley, but it worked because it really created a team that could overcome even other teams with great superstar college.\n\nI'm sensing a parable here. I'm sensing that you saw something in that Princeton basketball team that you like for society.\n\nMy father would tell us that we should watch Princeton basketball whenever possible. My father is a basketball coach, but at any rate, I knew Pete from the basketball team. He was a bench player. He was a good player. But those starters were really, was really a tight great group. He would come off the bench and knock down a couple threes and suddenly the game would tight. So I really admired Pete for that. I knew that he was in ROTC, and this was after 2001. Any Princeton student who was in the army was amazing to me before 2001. But any Princeton student who was in the military after 2001 was just a miraculous human.\n\nI mean, this is a university that was producing scads and scads of finance bankers and people who are gonna go on very, very lucrative careers, right?\n\nThe elites that your books have described with some disdain. Disdain may be a bit strong,\n\nMight be strong, but deep worry about the way in which they're impacting our country. When Pete came in to speak with me, we would talk about what it was to be someone in the military at Princeton as a student who intended to serve on the ground. So I had a lot of respect for Pete as a student. I still have a lot of respect for Pete based on that experience. And then after he finishes the thesis, he goes out serves. I kind of followed him a bit. He published things, and then the next time I see him pop up, he's on Fox News. And I was like, wow, there's Pete\n\nHeg. Seth's thesis was called Modern Presidential Rhetoric and the Cold War Context, a recent investigation by the Daily Princetonian newspaper found eight instances of uncredited material, sham, paraphrasing, and verbatim copying. In Heg Seth's thesis, a Pentagon spokesperson said there was no plagiarism and that the accusations were political. Whatever the case, Patrick Deneen taught for several years at Princeton, but wasn't offered tenure. And he moved on to Georgetown where he did get tenure. And at Georgetown he founded the Tocqueville Forum on the roots of American democracy. After several years at Georgetown, he moved to Notre Dame. In 2012, he felt that Notre Dame was, as he puts it, engaged in a more robustly Catholic form of higher education.\n\nAnd he wanted to raise his kids in a smaller town. His breakout book, why Liberalism Failed, was published in 20 18, 2 years into Donald Trump's first term.\n\nIt was not a response to what was happening electorally. It wasn't unc cognizant of what was happening electorally, but the content of that book. You finished writing\n\nThe book, if I recall correctly, just before Trump was elected, correct?\n\nYeah, it was around the time of the election. But that said, every chapter in that book had been in some way, shape, or form drafted in the previous decade, if not the previous 20 years. And so it wasn't a response to an immediate political situation. And of course it got picked up because the title certainly, but also I think the content, it captured a moment. It was for especially an intellectual class that had been blindsided and didn't know what was happening. And then this professor writes this book that seems at some level to answer that question. The day that it appeared, it was a Tuesday in January of 2018, David Brooks devoted his column to a discussion of the book, followed by a number of different columns in the New York Times, Washington Post.\n\nIt kind of just took off and became a very surprising bestseller, especially to me. But that book was really everything we've been talking about, long readings of Tocqueville and the Federalist Papers and Aristotle and Rousseau and Montesquieu, and distilling them as they touch our contemporary lives today. And then of course, I'm invited to countless interviews and then the book, it's translated, and that shocked me into 25 languages. Now, the entire time I'm sort of assuming, okay, this is all kind of scholarly and intellectual, but before I know it, it's getting picked up and discussed by various political figures among them. Of course, most famously today, JD Vance, who was not yet a senator, but had read it, and he began reaching out to me to talk about some of its ideas, and I was thrilled to do so.\n\nHe was interested in part because he was considering converting to Catholicism at the time time. That's\n\nRight. And we've talked quite a bit about his being drawn to Catholicism, Catholic social teaching, we\n\nShould say. He did convert, ultimately. I didn't wanna leave that hanging.\n\nHe did. He did enter the church. Then the journalists start sniffing this out and they think, oh, here's the puppet master. It's an absurd claim, but there's always this desire to say, who's the power or who's the brain behind? I mean, j D's got his own mind\n\nAnd he's, well, what's it been like for you to get brought into these political circles and debates, whether directly or indirectly?\n\nIt's a thing of ambivalence and confusion for me, because I think of myself first and foremost as someone who's just trying to parse through ideas, think through the nature of politics and how does that reflect on our contemporary moment?\n\nAnd that's satisfying for you. That's satisfying enough.\n\nThat's always been satisfying enough. On the other hand, I've always felt that part of my calling as a faculty member, as a scholar, is to, when asked to try to offer as best I can, an explanation for the views as I've been able to come to them, the conclusions I've been able to reach to be engaged in conversations and debates, it's a different thing when that gets caught up into politics. Now it's related to power. What's the utility?\n\nThere's one team versus the other. Right?\n\nOn the one hand, it's gratifying to have the interest of political figures from around the world who want to talk about ideas. Victor\n\nOrban, for instance.\n\nYeah. I mean, why wouldn't one want to talk to a prime minister of a major European country about one's ideas? But it turns out that's tantamount to academic heresy.\n\nSay a little bit more about that. Have you been penalized within the community for becoming a political figure or a politically associated figure?\n\nThere's absolutely no doubt.\n\nSo what happens when you walk down a sidewalk on Notre Dame campus? Now\n\nThey all cross the street. Now, I would say that any trajectory of my academic career has been more or less arrested in terms of academic status and accolades.\n\nWhat more are you looking for though, your tenured professor, I assume at Notre Dame?\n\nOf course. Of course. Well, there comes a point in your life where you've maybe reached a certain level of understanding and you've developed a academic worldview and people want to hear from it. Then you begin to get invited to give lectures, maybe some of the big lectures at the big universities. It's the kind of thing where as you reach the end of your career to make the circuit and that is not forthcoming.\n\nIt sounds as if you feel well, disappointed for sure, but maybe a bit aggrieved that your work is being misread because of people who are reading it and putting it to political purpose. Is that right?\n\nIt's an interesting consequence that on the one hand, the person in charge of Notre Dame's communications office was absolutely thrilled that I'm being interviewed by you and will appear on Freakonomics. Of course, universities always want to crow about the successes and the public prominence of their faculty at the same time, if that prominence is because it's in some ways now associated with a political set of figures and positions that\n\nThe Trump administration, let's just say, right?\n\nYes. And populism, that within academia is regarded as tantamount to fascism. It turns out that having now achieved one thing that universities appreciate and often crow about in terms of their faculty, it turns out it has the opposite effect. If I had just been working in the coal mines of academia and never appeared above the surface, that would've been perfectly fine. But it's the nature of the prominence now. So it's puzzling to me on the one hand. Okay, so I've written these things. It turns out they've gotten a lot of play, not necessarily with the direct intention of influencing this, that, or the other figure, and as a result, academically it's red redo negatively.\n\nDo you feel like persona non grata on campus at Notre Dame?\n\nThat's a good question. No, I don't feel like persona non grata, but I feel I, I, I don't think I could answer this. Sorry, Steve.\n\nWell, let me go back. You mentioned the comms department. Has anyone from Notre Dame tried to dissuade you from doing interviews, including this one? No,\n\nNot at all.\n\nDo you have to get clearance? No. If you did, it might not be forthcoming. It sounds like you're saying No.\n\nI would say, leaving aside the question of Notre Dame, one of the consequences of feeling this obligation when asked by journalists or by podcasters and so forth, when asked to talk about my worldview and arguments I've made, what I began to discover having agreed to most of these requests over the past several years, especially as we approached election seasons and 2020 and then 2024, these were not honest brokers. These would often be very prominent journalists that, you know, some pretty major news outlets.\n\nYou and I discussed one of these in private. Yes. Which we don't need to repeat, but the institution may rhyme with smoosh smirk SCHs. Yes,\n\nThat's one of them. But there are many,\n\nWhen you say they're not honest brokers though, Patrick, if you could explain that, I think it wouldd be really appreciated by people who listen because you know, I personally love journalism. I think journalism is a phenomenally valuable institution within a civic society. I\n\nAgree. I agree.\n\nWhen done well, like any institution, when done well, when\n\nDone well,\n\nPrint journalists like myself, we always used to make fun of tv. They'd say they call it a medium because it's neither rare nor well done. And we clung to our belief that, you know, old fashioned reporting, interviewing people, getting out the truth, et cetera, et cetera, was an incredibly valuable thing if done well. And so when I hear from someone like you who's been interviewed by people, whether they're presenting themselves as legitimate mainstream journalists or not, as you know, not honest brokers, it pains me because it hurts everyone and it hurts me, hurts what I do, but it hurts society, I think. So if you could give an example, I'm not asking you to name names. If you're dying to name a name, go for it.\n\nBut how this would work, what that conversation would be presented to you as, and what the actual conversation would be, and then what the publication of it would be?\n\nTypically, it would be some form of email, a phone call from a journalist saying, I'm writing this story on such and such leading up to the election, or about this political figure or that. And we'd really like to understand from you who seem to have written in this area as an academic and something of a, I guess, public intellectual. I would generally agree to be interviewed. We would set up a time, we'd do a zoom or we'd be a phone interview. Sometimes I would ask to do written responses, and it wasn't in terms of what I had to say or even the hostility of the questions. That's part of the game. It was how it would be framed, how the article would be written.\n\nAnd then the way in which the quotes would appear from me, it would say, you know, reflecting this tendency toward fascism, comm up, denine, something like that. Really trying to frame everything in the most negative light. Journalism, as we all know, reflects a particular progressive worldview today. Many of the journalists working today believe that it's not enough just to report as objectively and as clearly as possible in this case, what the responses of this particular person where they have to frame it in such a way that, you know what I think, and I'm gonna make sure that you know what should be thought.\n\nWhere do you think that instinct comes from? And I would just caveat that by saying that you're attributing that to the individual journalist, but I think often that's driven by the institution itself.\n\nWell, sure, they're being hired by these places.",

      "transcript_chunk": "ugh Shopify and that runs on Ruby on Rails. So Ruby on Rails is able to scale up to that level without using static typing in all of what it does. Now I know they've done certain experiments in certain ways because they are hitting some of the limits that you will hit with Dynamic typing and some of those limits you hit with Dynamic typing are actually, by the way, just limits you hit when you write 5 million lines of code.\n\nI think the Shopify monolith is about 5 million lines of code at that scale. Everything breaks because you're at the frontier of what humans are capable of doing with programming languages. The difference in part is that Ruby is such a succinct language that those 5 million, if they had been written in, let's just say Go or Java would've been 50 or 25 now, that might have alleviated some of the problems that you have when you work on huge systems with many programmers. But it certainly would also have compounded them trying to understand 25 million lines of code.\n\nSo the thing does scale. That's a persistent myth that it doesn't scale Shopify and and others. But Shopify think's a great example. By the way, I love Shopify and I love Toby. Amazing.\n\nYou gotta have Toby on. Yeah, for sure. Just talking to him this\n\nMorning for sure. He is a brilliant I I got to hang out with him in the desert somewhere, I forget in Utah. He's just a brilliant human and and and\n\nShopify (82m 12s):\nShopify, Shopify dot com slash Lex has been supporting this podcast for the longest time. I don't, I don't think actually Toby knows that they sponsor this podcast. I mean it's a big company, right? It's a huge company. I think just under 10,000 employees market cap of 120 billion GMV of a quarter of a trillion every quarter. And He's involved with the details though He is very much so. Funny story about Toby. Toby was on the Rails core team back in the mid two thousands. Toby himself wrote Active Merchant, which is one of the frameworks for creating shops. He wrote the liquid templating language that Shopify still uses to this day. He has a huge list of contributions to the Rails ecosystem and he's the CEO of the company. Yeah, I think it's just, it's very inspiring to me because it's such at the opposite end of what I like to do, I like to chisel code with my own hands most of the day. He runs a company of almost 10,000 people that is literally like world commerce, depends on it. A level of criticality I can't even begin to understand. And yet we can see eye to eye on so many of these fundamental questions in computer science and program development. That is a dynamic range to be able to encompass Rails being a great tool for the one developer who's just starting out with an idea who don't even fully know everything, who is right at the level where PHP would've been a good fit in those late nineties because yeah, I could probably upload something to an FTP server and so on. Rails does have more complexity than that, but it also has so much longer runway. The runway goes all the way to goddamn Shopify. That is about the most convincing argument I can make for sort of dynamic range that we can do a lot of it. And even having said that, Shopify is the outlier. Of course. I don't think about Shopify as the primary target when I write Rails. I think of the single developer, actually I do think about Shopify, but I don't think about Shopify now. I think of Shopify when Toby was writing Snow Devil, which was the first e-commerce store to sell snowboards that he created, that was the pre Shopify. Shopify he created all by himself. And that was possible because Ruby on Rails isn't just about Beautiful code, it's just as much about Productivity. It's just as much about the impact that an individual programmer is able to have that they can build system where they can keep the whole thing in their head and be able to move it forward such that you can go from one developer sitting and working on something and that something is Shopify and it turns into what it is today. When we talk about programming languages and we compare 'em, we often compare 'em at a very late stage. Like what is the better programming language for let's say Twitter in 2009 when it's already a huge success. Twitter was started on Ruby and Rails. They then hit some Scaling problems. It was a big debacle at the time. They end up then I think writing it in some other language, which by the way I think is the best advertisement ever for Ruby on Rails because nothing fucking happened for 10 years after they switched over, right? Essentially zero innovation. Some of that was because they were doing a long conversion and all of the early success in part came because they had the agility to quickly change and adopt and so forth. That's what startups needs. That's what Shopify needed. That's what Twitter needed. That's what everyone needs and that's the number one priority for Ruby on Rails to make sure that we don't lose that. Because what happens so often when development tools and program language driven by huge companies is that they mirror their org chart react and everything else needed to use. That is in some ways a reflection of how meta builts Facebook because of course it's because of course it's the destruction of that. I'm not saying React isn't a great tool and that can't be used by smaller teams. Of course it can, but it's born in a very different context than something like Ruby on Rails. Lemme say this a small aside because I think we might return to Shopify that celebrated often. Just a sort of personal note, this particular podcast has way more Sponsors and Sponsors that want to be Sponsors than I could possibly ever have. And it's really, really important for me to not give a shit and to be able to celebrate people. Like I celebrate people, I celebrate companies and it has, I don't care that they're sponsoring. I really don't care. I just wanna make that very explicit 'cause we're gonna continue saying positive things about Shopify. I don't care. Stop sponsoring. It doesn't really matter to me. But yeah, I just wanna make that explicit.\n\nSo, but to linger on the Scaling thing with the Twitter and the Shopify, can you just explain to me what Shopify is doing with the, with the Jet? What did they have to try to do to scale this thing? Because that's kind of an incredible story, right?\n\nYeah. So one of the great contributions that Shopify has made to the entire Ruby ecosystem, not just Rails but in particular Rails is Wiji. So Wiji is their compiler for, for Ruby. That just makes everything a lot more efficient and at Shopify scale eeking out even a five 10% improvement in Ruby's overhead and execution time is a huge deal. Now, Shopify didn't need Wget. Shopify was already running on the initial version of Ruby. That was, I think 10 times slower than what we have today. If you look back upon the Ruby 1 8 6, that Topi probably started on just as I started on and that was enough to propel Shopify to the scale that it has today.\n\nA lot of the Scaling conversation in is lost in a failure to distinguish two things. Scale is kind of one package we talk about when there are really multiple packages inside of it. One is runtime performance latency. How fast can you execute a single request? Can it happen fast enough that the user will not notice If your rails request takes a second and a half to execute, the user's gonna notice your app is gonna feel slow and sluggish. You have to get that response time down below, let's say at least 300 milliseconds. I like to target a hundred milliseconds as my latency. That's kind of performance.\n\nHow much performance of that kind of latency can you squeeze out of a single CPU core that tells you something about what the price of a single request will be. But then whether you can deal with 1 million requests a second like Shopify doing right now, if you do a thousand requests a second, you just need X boxes to get up to a million. And what you'll actually find is that when it comes to programming languages, they're all the same in this way. They all scale largely beautifully horizontally. You just add more boxes. The hard parts of Scaling a Shopify is typically not the program language, it's the database.\n\nAnd that's actually one of the challenges that Shopify has now is how do you deal with MySQL at the scale that they're operating at? When do you need to move to other databases to get worldwide performance? All of these things, the questions about Scaling Ruby are economic questions. If we're spending so and so much on application servers, if we can get just 5% more performance out of Ruby, well we could save 5% of those servers and that could filter down into the budget. Now that analysis concludes into basically one thing. Ruby is a luxury language. It's a luxury, the highest luxury in my opinion.\n\nIt is the Coco Chanel of programming languages. Something that not everyone can afford. And I mean this in the best possible way. There are some applications on the internet where each request has so little value. You can't afford to use a luxurious language like Ruby to program in it. You simply have tolum it with a C or a go or some other low level language or a rust talk about line noise there for hot sake. That's like the thrift store of languages. Exactly where you need kind of just, you need a very low level to do it. You can't afford to use a luxury language to use to, to build it with. That's not true of Shopify. It wasn't true of Basecamp even back in 2004.\n\nIt's not been true of 99% of all web applications ever created because the main cost component of 99% of web applications is not CPU course. It's wet course, it's human course, it's human capacity to understand and involve systems. It's their personal Productivity. I did a calculation once when someone had for the 400th time set that, oh, if you switch from Ruby to some faster language, you could save a bunch of money. And I calculated it out that at the time, and I think the last time I did this calculation was almost a decade ago, we were spending about 15% of our operating budget on Ruby application service.\n\nSo for me to improve my cost profile of the business by seven percentage points, I'd have to pick something twice as fast. That's quite hard. Versus if Ruby and Ruby on Rails was even 10% more productive than something else, I would move the needle far more because making individual programmers more productive actually matters a lot more. This is why people are so excited about ai. This is why they're freaking out over the fact that a single programmer in Silicon Valley who makes $300,000 a year can now do the work of three or five, at least in theory. I haven't actually seen that fully in practice, but let's just assume the theory is correct if not now, than in six months.\n\nThat's a huge deal. That matters so much more than whether you can squeeze a few more cycles out of the CPU when it comes to these kinds of business applications. If you're making unreal engine rendering stuff like Tim Sweeney you had on, yeah, he needs to really sweat all those details. The Nan Night engine can't run on Ruby. It's never going to, it was not meant for that fine. These kinds of business applications absolutely can, and everything that people are excited about AI for right now, that extra capacity to just do more. That was why we were excited about Ruby back in the early two thousands. That was be because I saw that if we could even squeeze out a 10% improvement of the human programmer, we'd be able to do so much more for so much less.\n\nProbably argue about this, but I really like working together with ai, collaborating with ai and I would argue that the kind of code you want AI to generate is human readable, human interpretable. Yes. If it's generating Pearl golf code, it's just, it's not a collaboration. So it has to be speaking the human. It's not just you're writing the prompts in English. You also want to read the responses in the human interpretable language like Ruby. Right? So it's, that's actually is beneficial for AI too. 'cause you've kind of said that for you the sculptor, the sort of the elitist Coco Chanel sculptor, you want to on your fancy keyboard to type every single letter yourself of your own fingers.\n\nBut it's also that the benefit of Ruby also applies in once some of that is written by AI and you're actually doing with your own fingers. The editing.\n\nYes.\n\nBecause you can in interact with it because it's human interpretable.\n\nThe paradigm I really love with this was something Elon actually said on one of your shows when you guys were talking about neural link, that Neuralink allows the bandwidth between you and the machine to increase that language, either spoken or written is very low bandwidth. If you are to calculate just how many bits we can exchange as we are sitting here, it's very slow. Ruby has a much higher bandwidth of communication revealed conveys so much more concept per character than most other programming language do. So when you are collaborating with ai, you want really high bandwidth.\n\nYou want it to be able to produce programs with you, whether you're letting it write the code or not, that both of you can actually understand really quickly and a grand com or a grand concept, a grand system into far fewer parts that both of you can understand. Now, I actually love collaborating with AI too. I love chiseling my code and the way I use AI is in a separate window. I don't let it drive my code. I've tried that. I've tried the cursors and the wind surfaces and I don't enjoy that way of writing. And one of the reasons I do enjoy that way of writing is I can literally feel competence draining out of my fingers.\n\nLike that level of immediacy with the material disappears. And the where I felt this the most was I did this remix of Ubuntu called Amma Cube when I switched to Linux and it's all written in Bash. I'd never written nice, any serious amount of code in Bash before. Yeah. So I was using AI to collaborate, to write a bunch of bash with me because I needed all this. I knew what I wanted. I could express it in Ruby. But I thought it was an interesting challenge to filter through Bash because what I was doing was setting up a Linux machine. That's basically what Bash was designed for. It's a great constraint. But what I found myself doing was asking AI for the same way of expressing a conditional, for example, in Bash over and over again that by not typing it, I wasn't learning it, I was using it, I was getting the expression I wanted, but I wasn't learning it.\n\nAnd I got a little scared. I got a little scared like, is this the end of learning? Am I no longer learning if I'm not typing? And the way I, for me recast that was, I don't wanna give up on the ai. It's such a better experience as a programmer to look up APIs, to get a second opinion on something, to do a draft. But I have to do the typing myself because you learn with your fingers, if you're learning how to play the guitar, you can watch as many YouTube wi videos as you want. You're not gonna learn the guitar. You have to put your fingers on the strings to actually learn the motions. And I think there is a parallel here to programming where programming has to be learned in part by the actual typing.\n\nI'm just really, this is, this is fascinating. Listen, part of my brain agrees with you. A hundred percent part doesn't, I think AI should be in the loop of learning. Now current systems don't do that, but I think it's very possible for cursor to say, to basically force you to type certain things. So like if you set the mode of learning, I just, I don't want to be this sort of give up on ai. I really, I think, I think Vibe coding is a skill. So for an experienced programmer's too easy to dismiss Vibe coding as a thing.\n\nI\n\nAgree, I wouldn't dismiss it.\n\nBut I think you need to start building that skill and start to figure out how do you prevent the competency from slipping away from your fingers and brain.",

      "transcript_chunk": "there are instances where either a regional fed president like you or someone on the board of Governors or maybe the chair himself, Powell in this case might change minds or at least rally consensus. Can you gimme an example of that?\n\nI'm not allowed to give you examples of that 'cause we're not out of the period that the transcripts come out. But historically, yes, you're correct. There are times when there are multiple dissents or there can be arguments and people can't change their mind. There was one episode in the 1980s where new governors had been appointed. Paul Volcker was the chair. There was a vote where the chair was gonna be outvoted. They were going to do the opposite of what the chair was advocating.\n\nThat's extremely unusual. And Volcker said, look, if this happens, I'm gonna resign. And they went back in and they revolted In the two thousands coming out of the great recession, some of the regional presidents disagreed with Chair Bernanke and they dissented repeatedly. Not enough of them were dissenting to change the policy, but there were fundamental and lasting differences of opinion.\n\nAnd does that dissent filter back to the White House\n\nFilter back? How what? What do you\n\nMean? I guess what I'm thinking about is there's so much news going on right now. There are congressional budget debates, tax debates, tariff threats. How much does current policymaking intersect with the Fed? Let's say you personally, you're looking at these policy proposals and as an economist, you're envisioning probably like a lot of the nonpartisan analysts are talking about right now, that this economic agenda might be incendiary down the line, in which case the Fed may end up being the fire department. That's my outside view. I'm guessing it's wrong, but tell me what the inside view is.\n\nOkay, let's back up to the founding of the Fed and what is the Fed's job? The Federal Reserve Act gives the Fed two jobs when setting monetary policy.\n\nThis is your famous dual mandate, the\n\nFamous dual mandate. It says right in the law, we are to maximize employment and stabilize prices. That's the job in its totality. Nothing more, nothing less in the setting of monetary policy. So anything that affects prices or employment, we are required by law to think about it.\n\nI can imagine some people hearing that as a fairly narrow prescription and some people hearing that as well. That's everything.\n\nAnd they're both right. As we say in Chicago, there's no bad weather, there's only bad clothing. You tell us the conditions and we'll figure out what's the correct jacket to put on. And that's true at the Fed too. Conditions change all the time. Sometimes it's policy, sometimes it can be geopolitics. The productivity growth rate can change. We can have excess demand animal spirits. You think we have a bubble? There are things happening all the time. That's why we meet every six weeks at the FOMC to be the tip of the spear of economic stabilization. Now graft onto it, policy changes, periods of major policy uncertainty.\n\nWe have to about it because if those policies are going to affect employment or prices, the law says that's what we're supposed to look at. We're not in the elections business and it's not the role of the Fed to express opinion about fiscal policy. There was a time in my life when I was in that business and once you're a sworn member of the Federal Reserve, it's like the Knights Watch or something, you're out of that business. We have to think through if it's tariffs, I go out and I talk to the auto executives well before April 2nd, the people in the district who are granted more manufacturing intensive, more supply chain intensive than other districts, they were expressing if these tariffs of this magnitude come in, we are afraid that it is gonna take us back to the period of a few years ago where costs are out of control from\n\nCOVID, supply chain issues from COVID.\n\nSo there was an inflationary period in 21, 22 and there was a COVID disruption period of 2020. They said this might take us back to the 2122 where inflation from cost is raging, or if they're as big as what some of them are advocating, it might take us back to 2020 where we just couldn't make the product because we couldn't get the parts.\n\nSo as you gathered this information in your role as the Chicago Fed President, you're talking to people who have experience, they have stature and they have skin in the game. What purpose does that information ultimately serve? You bring it to the FOMC and then what?\n\nHopefully whatever I get people will listen to and collectively we gotta decide at the end of the day, the Fed in a grand way has only one tool and that's the interest rate. We have a balance sheet, we have different things, but they're fundamentally about credit conditions and financial conditions in the economy. I think of it as a screwdriver. Hey, if things start getting too loose, then you tighten it and if things are too tight then you loosen it. But if it's, you know, can you make us breakfast? No, we, we basically can't. We don't have a tool to do that. We try to think through not just backward looking but also forward looking for the economic outlook.\n\nWhat are these changes gonna do to employment or to inflation? But\n\nIt's a waiting game then because you're not a policymaking arm. But I would imagine it's frustrating, especially because you as an economist who has done a lot of policy analysis, a lot of research over the years, part of the challenge of doing that research and part of the fun is trying to estimate effects of different causes. As we're talking today, you know Moody's recently downgraded US debt and it set off some alarms. A lot of the budget and tax proposals being discussed on the hill right now are expected to contribute substantially to federal debt. So these all seem like upstream events that are theoretically, especially in the mind of an economist, like you gonna have potentially major downstream consequences.\n\nI would see the fed at the end of that in two or three or five years needing to respond to those events. Is that what you do? You kind of wait.\n\nThe thing about the data, the official data come out with a lag. So they're one month, one quarter, one week later. If you committed to never think about the outlook only to look backward, you would miss a lot of things. You would be behind the curve multiple times. Policy is just one of an infinite number of shocks that you have to think through. It's not special in that way. If there's a war in the Middle East and the price of oil goes up $30 a barrel, we gotta think about that too and not just wait to see what it does. In my view, there's a great success story of the last couple of years that's worth thinking about, which also makes me somewhat comfortable that Chad GPT is not gonna replace the central bank and the FOMC anytime soon.\n\nI was\n\nGonna ask you whether AI would be at least a useful tool in monetary policy. I would assume so.\n\nIt might be a useful tool. You're never gonna hear me say we should throw away tools, but AI is only as good as the training sample. Take the beginning of 2023, that's when I joined the Fed. Inflation is still well above the 2% target that the Fed has laid out. There are a number of smart people saying you cannot get the inflation rate down without pain. Serious pain. You had Larry Summers saying unemployment would have to go above 6% for five consecutive years before you would see inflation come down chat.\n\nGPT would have looked at the historical record and said, what should we do? And would've said, Jack the interest rate up to 15% and have a recession. 'cause that's how you get rid of it. But the economic analysis said this is a very weird business cycle. So those previous business cycles might not apply and if you could heal the supply chain, you might be able to bring down inflation without a recession and they did it. So in 2023 I said it was a hall of fame year because inflation fell by close to as much as it has ever fallen in a single year.\n\nAnd not only was there not a recession, the unemployment rate never even got above 4%. That's a triumph for economic analysis, not just historical patterns.\n\nNow to be fair, most economists were predicting recession. In fact, there's the old joke about economists have correctly predicted 19 of the last three recessions, right?\n\nYes. And look, the Bloomberg economists predicted in December of 22, there was a 100% chance of recession in 2023. But it's because they were thinking historically they're not wrong. In the past that wasn't wrong.\n\nComing up after the break, will Donald Trump's so-called Maximalist embrace of tariffs cause a recession and will the Fed be able to maintain its political independence?\n\nThere's close to unanimity on the importance of Fed independence, mostly rooted in just go look at countries where they don't have it.\n\nI'm Steven Dubner.

Baa ba.\n\nI am speaking today with Austin Gouldsby, president and CEO of the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago. The second Trump administration, even more than the first, has upended all sorts of political norms, right? A place like the Fed is built on political norms. So I'm curious how you and your colleagues are approaching that. I mean the president of the United States, Donald Trump is called your boss. Jerome Powell, a man he appointed, he's called him a fool, a major loser. I can't imagine that as much as one might intellectually try to insulate oneself from the noise that it's possible to do so entirely. So how does that affect the function of the Fed,\n\nThe rules of the Fed, the rules of the FOMC say, I'm not allowed to speak for anyone else. I'm not allowed to speak for the Fed. I can only speak for myself. I would just say that before I was ever at the Fed, just go ask economists, they're unanimous that it's critically important that the central bank be independent of political interference when setting the interest rate. That's the notion of fed independence. If you want inflation to come back, go take away fed independence and you'll get inflation back. It makes me uncomfortable if people are truly advocating not having central bank independence.\n\nYou know what happens when there's political interference? Their incentives are different than long-term price stability and maximizing employment independence is never one for all times. It has to be re-earn in every generation it seems. But\n\nLet's acknowledge, or I'll acknowledge at least that Fed independence has come under attack from the current administration. So what role do regional fed presidents like you as opposed to the DC based governors have when it comes to ensuring and continuing fed independence from the executive branch?\n\nThe role of reserve banks is critically important to be independent monetary policy voices on the committee. They have played that role over the 112 years that the Fed has been around. There are many examples where important ideas about monetary policy or about the state of the economy came up through the reserve banks. I don't agree with all of my colleagues all of the time and they don't agree with me. A key part of what makes this as important a deliberative body as it is, is exactly this, that we're coming from 12 different regions plus Washington DC to express independent views.\n\nIf you take it away, you should fully well expect inflation to be coming back.\n\nI've heard you cite a mentor of yours, the economist, Jim Tobin, as saying that economics is most useful in a crisis. You talked about 2023 as being a weird business cycle. When you look at the US economy today, do you see a crisis? And if not, what would you say are the characteristics about this economy that make it significantly different or confusing from the past?\n\nThe thing that fundamentally made this period, let's call it from 2020 to today, extremely unusual, is that normally the business cycle is driven by the most cyclically sensitive sectors and those are the most interest rate sensitive sectors as well. Durable goods, manufacturing, business, fixed investment, large consumer durables purchases, autos, stuff like that. Those are very cyclical industries and they're ones where the interest makes a big difference. As we go into 2020, it's the first and only recession ever where demand for housing, durable goods, cars, all of that went up in the downturn.\n\nAnd the bunch of stuff that is normally recession proof has nothing to do with the business cycle. Like going to the dentist, all of those, those services dried up. So we had a business cycle that looked nothing like a normal business cycle and it was a business cycle where if you say what is the interest rate sensitivity of having elective surgery, nobody ever asked that question before. Then it was like, well you stupid fed, why aren't you predicting what's gonna be happening in large measure? It's that this business cycle is really weird and people's spending shifted heavily to physical goods and away from services, which was fighting against the 80 year trend.\n\nAnd now as it comes back, we are still living with that to say nothing about the supply chain disruptions,\n\nWhere are we in relation to normal? Now in that regard,\n\nWe're mostly back for the consumer share. We're mostly back to the heavily dominated services.\n\nSo this question is maybe too reductive or maybe unanswerable, but how do you as a Fed president see the Trump tariff policy? And I realize that there are, you know, 1800 different components of that. How do you think about that, especially compared to supply chain disruptions that were created by COVID? Do you see this as potentially a second wave?\n\nThere's kind of two parts about it. The first, the president and Congress in their wisdom can pass any tariff policy they want. That's a straight fiscal policy that becomes a condition that affects prices and affects employment. And if it does that, then the Fed has to think about it. The law says we have to think about it. I went out and talked to business people and consumers throughout the seventh district that made me even before April 2nd nervous, the econ 1 0 1 version of what tariffs would do might not be subtle enough to capture what was happening.\n\nThe econ 1 0 1 version says tariffs that are permanent, there's no retaliation, there's no escalation. They're just a one time increase in the cost. That should be a transitory shock to inflation.",

      "transcript_chunk": "d you give them the fare and then 90 to 95% of people at a tip on it, it's face to face. There's a social norm, there's a lot of social pressure to give a tip in that situation. So\n\nHere's how Uber tipping was set up. The app generally wouldn't give a passenger the option to tip until they were out of the car and until the driver had given the passenger a rating, which the passenger doesn't see, by the way. So neither the rating nor the tip would be contingent on each other, which meant no quid pro quo, especially because unlike a waiter or waitress in your favorite restaurant, the odds are you will never see that Uber driver again. The fact\n\nIs, is that very few people meet twice\n\nIn the biggest cities where Uber operates, there is a less than 1% chance that the same driver and rider will ever be matched up twice. So Uber tipping is presumably not about social pressure or reciprocity or extortion. Instead, it's supposed to represent true appreciation in monetary form of good service. So how appreciative are Uber passengers?\n\nSo a first fact from our data is that roughly 15 to 16% of Uber rides are actually tipped. Think\n\nAbout that for a second. That's about one of every six rides that gets tipped versus about six of every six restaurant meals. So not great news for Uber drivers thinking they'd be raking in tip money. But good news for John List and Uber who remember, we're shooting for attend 20% tipping rate. Now let's get into what list learned about the tippers. There are three categories here. Passengers who always tip\n\nOnly 1% of people tip on every trip.\n\nThere are people who never tip.\n\nThat's actually 60% of people. Six 0% of people never tip once. So\n\nThat leaves 39% who sometimes tip? Yes,\n\nExactly. You're talking about people who are tipping one out of eight times.\n\nOkay, so 1% of Uber passengers treat the ride like a restaurant meal, automatically adding a tip. 60% are saying, no thank you. I've already paid for the ride, so I'm not going to give you more of my money. Which if you're even a little bit anti tipping in general sounds pretty sensible. But then 39% of passengers tipped occasionally. Does that mean that Uber successfully made tipping about exceptional service?\n\nSo one of the most surprising results is that when you look at the data pattern, it's actually the rider variables that are roughly three times more important than the driver variables.\n\nLet's translate what list said out of economists speak. What he means is that the biggest factor in whether a passenger tips is simply what kind of person the passenger is that is a bigger determinant than the driver or the car itself or the route.\n\nSo if I unpack that a little bit, the first thing you can think about is the star rating.\n\nRemember, just as uber passengers can rate drivers, Uber drivers also rate passengers.\n\nThe riders who have a five star rating, they're more than twice as likely to tip than riders who have a 4.75 rating.\n\nWhat kind of passenger has five stars?\n\nYou know they're punctual or they're nice in the car, they're giving respect to the driver.\n\nOkay? And these five star passengers happen to be the same people who are most likely to tip every time. In other words, they're just wonderful people, but there aren't that many of them, just 1% of Uber riders. So who are these generous souls? What kind of person is most likely to tip an Uber driver? For starters, they're most likely to be male.\n\nA man is about 19% more likely to tip than a female rider.\n\nAnd that's an interesting finding, especially because it is the opposite of what John list's. Own research shows about charitable giving.\n\nWomen consistently across the entire distribution give more money to charities than men do.\n\nAnd why is Uber tipping so different?\n\nMy intuition is it's because this is anonymous. The world of charitable giving tends to have a lot of social pressure, and what the literature also has taught us is that women are much more likely to change their behavior in the face of social cues. My intuition would be if you looked at tipping to taxi cab drivers or restaurants, that the difference would not be as stark and women might even tip a little bit more conditional on having the same income levels as men in those cases.\n\nNow, to what degree, if any, are you able to control for income of the riders in your study? It may be that the men are wealthier. Yes.\n\nWhat we do find is that riders from lower income areas tend to tip less than riders from higher income areas. But even after we correct or adjust for those income area differences, we still find that men do tip more than women.\n\nYou also write that tips tend to be higher during very early morning hours between 3:00 AM and 5:00 AM and that these hours have a disproportionate percentage of airport and business trips. What it calls to mind to me is those trips may be being expensed and may not be coming out of pocket, and maybe people are more generous with tipping if it's not their own money.\n\nI think you're exactly right. I think those can be expensed. What you also find though is that tips tend to be high on Friday and Saturday evenings. So this is the going out to eat and party crowd.\n\nThis may or may not mean that the consumption of alcohol makes people more generous. The Uber data cannot answer that question, so draw your own conclusions. But there is one huge conclusion. The Uber data seems to point to most people when given the option to tip do not tip. And when they do, it doesn't have much to do with the quality of their experience.\n\nThe bulk of the reasons why a driver will get tipped is because of these things that are outside of their control. But that said, there are many things that the driver can control that do impact the tip.\n\nFor example,\n\nFor example, if you look at drivers with a five star rating, their tip close to 50% more often than those with a 4.75 rating. So the quality of the driver matters,\n\nIt matters, but again, not very much compared to whether a given passenger happens to be a tipper or a nont tipper. Similarly, there are other trip characteristics that may affect tips how the driver drives, for instance, which Uber can measure via telematics information from the driver's phone.\n\nHard accelerations matter, and if you have more of those, you receive less in tips. Hard braking matters. If you have more episodes of hard braking, you receive fewer tips.\n\nThe age of the car also matters a little bit.\n\nDrivers in the old cars are tip slightly less than drivers in the new cars\n\nAnd the language the driver speaks which list measured by seeing whether drivers keep the language on the Uber app in the default setting, which is English or they change it.\n\nAnd what we find is that those drivers who change the default language, those drivers end up getting tipped much less as well.\n\nOne way to increase your tips as an Uber driver is to be female. What we\n\nFind is a really strong result that female drivers receive about 12% more than male drivers in tips. Now what's interesting though is that both female and male riders tip female drivers more\n\nEarlier, research of yours at Uber found a gender pay gap with men earning more, even though the algorithm is gender blind. I'm curious whether tipping substantially shrinks that gap.\n\nWhen you include tipping, that difference reduces by about 13%. So you still have a pretty large effect. Now the reason why it doesn't lessen by more than that is that tips are only about 4% of fares.\n\nOkay? So cumulative tipping on the Uber app is only about 4% of the fair total. Yes, that's a lot less than the standard 15 or 20% tip in restaurants, but still 4% of extra money on millions and millions of Uber rides. Surely that's gotta be good news for the average Uber driver, doesn't it?\n\nDriver earnings actually do not increase on average because of tipping.\n\nWait a minute, how can that be?\n\nWhat happens is when you add tipping to the app, more drivers come online and they supply more hours. So that shifts out the labor supply curve and just that shift alone, of course decreases wages. But then you have tips added onto that that make wages roughly the same as what they were before\n\nJohn List and his fellow researchers did find one lever they could press to increase the net amount of tipping, changing the default setting of the suggested tip amount.\n\nOne trip might get a default of would you like to tip a dollar, $3 or $5\n\nAnother rider? Meanwhile,\n\nThey might receive a preset of, do you wanna tip $2, $3 and $5? And those defaults or presets matter a lot. Roughly 16.5% of trips are tipped when you have a low preset versus about 14.5% When you have a higher preset.\n\nWhat's the median amount tipped? However, in the different options\n\nWhen you have higher presets, people tip less often, but they end up tipping more in the end. So if you want to increase tipping, what you want is a higher preset within reason\n\nAfter the break. As you heard earlier, the Respir tour, Danny Meyer thinks restaurant tipping is a bad idea, so he got rid of it. We'll hear how that's going. And does the tipping scholar who wanted to ban tipping still feel the same way? That's right.

So while many of his restaurants like Gramercy Tavern and Union Square Cafe and the modern are well-regarded high-end restaurants, the style of service is like Meyer himself. Midwestern warm. This combination of warm service and good food translates into big tips for the wait staff. You might think that Meyer as the employer of the people getting these big tips, might like this, but you'd be wrong.\n\nI decided to take on the tipping system back in 2015 and here we are in 2019 and we've learned a lot.\n\nThat's right. Meyer started to eliminate tipping in his restaurants a few years ago, his menus would say hospitality included, which meant that prices were higher, but you'd no longer have to add a tip to help pay the server's salary.\n\nWe never wanted to hire people who would only be nice to you in expectation of a higher reward.\n\nWe made an episode about it back then. It's called the no Tipping point if you wanna check it out. As we mentioned earlier, Meyer's Restaurant Empire also includes Shake Shack.\n\nI will credit Shake Shack with having inspired me to take this step in our full service restaurants. There are no tip jars at Shake Shack and there's no opportunity to tip a Shake Shack. If we can make the economics work where we're selling, you know, a five, six, $7 burger. Why in the world can we not make this work when we're serving you a hundred dollars dinner at Gramercy Tavern? It just doesn't make sense to me.\n\nThe haphazard sense of tipping also doesn't make sense to Meyer.\n\nEverybody practically leaves a tip in a full service restaurant. Nobody leaves a tip when they go to McDonald's. Some people leave a tip in Uber. Almost everybody leaves a tip with a taxi driver. And so I think that whole social norm thing is very, very confusing to people. And I'm just happy to opt on the side of saying, you know that price we put on the menu that covers everything.\n\nBut Meyer wasn't only thinking about his customers, one of the biggest challenges of running a restaurant is retaining good employees. It's a business with a lot of turnover and turnover is bad for business. One obvious way to keep your employees is to pay them. Well, the wait staff and bartenders at Meyer's restaurants were getting paid Well thanks to all that tipping. But the same couldn't be said for all the people who actually prepare and cook the food and wash the dishes and keep the place running. Meyer found that the tipped employees at his restaurants were earning about two and a half times what the back of the house employees made were they really doing two and a half times the work and the pay gap between tipped and non tipped kept growing\n\nEvery time menu prices go up and they've only gone up over the course of my career, the tipped employee is making more because the tip is just a multiplier of the menu price.\n\nThis pay gap had a variety of effects. One was that the people who spent time and money training to be chefs didn't wanna work as chefs.\n\nWe were seeing more graduates from the Culinary Institute of America, Johnson and Wales, the Institute for Culinary Education, applying for dining room positions than I had seen in my entire career because they realized they couldn't afford to live in New York and pursue the thing that had always been their dream. The\n\nPay gap between cooks and servers also created ill will and led to high turnover in the kitchen.\n\nI increasingly saw this divide growing and growing and growing between the compensation possibilities between tipped employees and employees that did not legally qualify to make tips.\n\nWhat does Meyer mean when he says that kitchen workers don't legally qualify to make tips? Because you'd think one easy solution to this problem would be to simply pool the tip money and redistribute some of it to the kitchen workers, but you can't do that. One quirk of the hospitality industry is that restaurants are allowed to pay servers what's called a tipped wage, which is below the minimum wage as long as tips make up the difference. This caveat is called the tip credit and restaurants use it to lower their labor costs. But one restriction of the tip credit is that it applies only to employees who spend at least 80% of their time in a customer facing role. So a restaurant can pool their tips and distribute them among the wait staff, bartenders and hostesses, but not the kitchen crew.\n\nI might think twice if I believe that the legislature was going to create a new law that permitted tips to be shared everywhere. That has not happened. But even if they did do that, it would still lead me to say this is not a professional way to treat people. Tipping in and of itself I don't think fosters the professionalism that we're looking for in our industry. If you think about every industry where tipping happens, it's often not a full-time career. I don't tip my airline pilot or my lawyer or my teacher or the person who's interviewing me on their podcast. That's a profession\n\nPodcasting a profession. Anyway, for all these reasons, Danny Meyer decided to eliminate tipping at all his restaurants.\n\nWe've converted about one every four to six months.",

      "transcript_chunk": "world as quote the most complicit in helping individuals to hide their finances from the rule of law. This is not a good look for any country. And over the years, some members of Congress have tried to address the problem.\n\nThe United States passed, I think a landmark law, the Corporate Transparency Act in 2020. So that's pretty important legislation that requires that company owners that we get photo ID for them.\n\nThis law went into effect at the start of 2024, but in March of this year, the Trump administration announced that the law would not be enforced against US citizens and companies. According to Hal Weitzman, Delaware was heavily involved in lobbying for this new law. Yeah,\n\nSo the solution that we've come up with is rather than asking people at the point that they register the company who's behind this company, we're gonna let them register a company anonymously and then a month later they have to file another form with the federal government saying who's behind the company. It's a bit like imagine Steven. Imagine you got on a flight and you flew somewhere internationally and then a month later you had to send in a photocopy of your passport. It's a bit like that. And so when you ask transparency, campaigners, what do you think we should do? They said, just ask people at the moment that they incorporate who they are, you're gonna register at the state level, but then you're gonna identify yourself at the federal level a month later.\n\nWhy would we set up a bifurcated system like that? Only because Delaware doesn't want to add another question to its form. Who are you? And then ask. Its registering agents to verify that you are who you say you are\n\nComing up after the break. How did Delaware get this kind of leverage and how do they keep it?\n\nThe bottom line is it comes down to money. Okay.\n\nI'm Steven Dubner. This is Freakonomics Radio. We will be right back. Okay. From what we've learned so far, the Delaware franchise, what Hal Weitzman calls the state's legal industrial complex is valuable to legitimate corporations looking to profit, maximize, and to illegitimate players looking to dodge the law. But let's be honest, it is also incredibly valuable to Delaware itself.\n\nThe legal industry is very important to Delaware's economy.\n\nThat is Deneen Damon,\n\nI am a director with Richard's Lay and Finger, which is the largest law firm in Wilmington, Delaware.\n\nWilmington is the biggest city in Delaware, but still it only has around 70,000 residents. That includes a lot of lawyers, many of whom Damon knows personally.\n\nThe Delaware Bar is very intimate. We're also known as a bar that operates in what I call the Delaware way. That means you may be with different law firms and you may compete with other law firms for some of the same business, but at the end of the day, we're all moving in the same direction.\n\nAnd how influential is the Delaware way?\n\nThe laws in Delaware absolutely have formed the basis for some of the most monumental decisions when it comes to corporations. We are very protective of our laws.\n\nThey are especially protective of what's known as the Delaware General Corporation law. That is the statute that governs the companies that are incorporated in Delaware, which as we've already heard, includes most big American companies. And what's involved in this protection?\n\nSo there's a corporate council that is constantly reviewing the corporate statute, looking at how entities are used, are there issues that have popped up through various court cases that might need to be addressed? Take for example, the use of electronic means. When these statutes were initially drafted, everything was done on paper. If you think about where we are now, most things are done electronically over the computer. So updating the statute over time to allow for electronic signatures and the filing of documents electronically, that's what the Bar Association committees are laser focused on doing, making sure that that work is done in a very meaningful way, in a very consistent way, and also in a very timely way.\n\nAs Hal Weitzman described it earlier, the Delaware franchise is an efficiency maximizer.\n\nYeah, that's right. What it exemplifies is a kind of clubby system that is the Delaware way heavy on backroom wheeling and dealing scant on democratic oversight.\n\nAs Weitzman sees it, the chief crop of Delaware is corporate law.\n\nIt exports corporate law all over the United States and all over the world. It sets the standard. That code is written by 27 working lawyers who are part of this corporation, law Council of the Delaware bar. They meet in private and they issue proposed changes every year to the law. And then they present these often very technical proposals to the Delaware State legislature without any explanation, without any justification of why these changes are necessary.\n\nAs I imagine the state legislators trying to assess the merits of this argument. And I've also read in your book that Delaware has the least well-educated state house in the US with a pretty high share of lawmakers not holding a college degree and a very low level of lawyers in legislature as well. I imagine this transaction as if someone brings to me the findings of a recent set of experiments about nuclear fusion and says, Hey Dubner, what do you think? Is that about what we're talking about? Yeah,\n\nI mean, they're told these are the experts. Here's their proposals, and they effectively rubber stamped them. The thing that I found interesting about the process is these are working lawyers. They appear in court, they argue cases under the laws that they themselves are writing. So being in the University of Chicago, it brings to mind the work of the legendary U Chicago Nobel laureate, George Siegler, who introduced the idea of regulatory capture. And in regulatory capture interest groups come to control lawmaking and regulation of their own sectors, and then the regulators sort of become lobbyists for the industries they oversee.\n\nDelaware has kind of perfected that because the lawyers don't even need to lobby the legislature to change the corporate code. They just write it themselves and it gets rubber stamped. So the system's efficient, it's effective, it's just not democratic. There's no checks and balances. There's an interesting story that encapsulates this system in 2017. There's a lawmaker in Delaware now retired, A guy called John Alco styled himself as the Bernie Sanders of Delaware and John Alco proposed that Delaware should require agents who register companies to check the name of the companies against a list called the OFAC List.\n\nBasically a list of organizations that the US has deemed to be terrorist organizations. This is a pretty non-controversial proposal. In fact, it actually was adopted later by Delaware as a law. But when John Alco tried to promote it, he was asked, has this gone through the process? Alco says, what do you mean what process in Delaware changes to the corporate code have to come from the corporation Law Council of the Delaware Bar? In other words, you and elected law maker have no right to make laws. Only the unelected lawyers have the right to make laws.\n\nAnd these lawyers, Weitzman argues inevitably make laws that protect and promote the Delaware franchise. He points back to the Corporate Transparency Act, the federal legislation that Delaware pushed hard to shape, thereby preserving Delaware's right to allow companies to register anonymously.\n\nAnd why is it so resistant to knowing who's behind them? Because most companies will be perfectly happy to tell us who the owners are. So it's really just who are we protecting? A tiny number of wrongdoers.\n\nI think it's definitely an unfair label for us to have\n\nIne Damon again, for the defense,\n\nThe probability of bad actors using Delaware entities for nefarious purposes increases just by the sheer number of entities that are being formed on an annual basis. But I don't think that's a fair analysis. There is a rigorous process in place to form an entity in Delaware. You have counsel working with you to submit the proper documentation. It's not as easy, you know, to simply draft up three paragraphs, submit something to the state, and you're done. I think oftentimes people assume that because it's a relatively quick process, that it's also a relatively easy process. And those two are not analogous. It's a quick process because we have a system in place.\n\nThe law firms here and the lawyers here are well versed in entity creation. So we know what advice to give our clients. We know how to lead them through the process. This is what we do every day. This is what we do for a living.\n\nThe bottom line is it comes down to money. Okay,\n\nThat again is John Casara, the former treasury investigator.\n\nThis is state government greed. That's the bottom line. They do it because it generates revenue, and to a lesser extent, it generates some job opportunities. Now, this is Delaware, but then you extrapolate that overseas and you've got all these little islands in the South Pacific or in the Caribbean or elsewhere. They don't really have much out there, but you know, bat guano. And so what are you gonna do? You gotta get something to generate money. So they set up these financial havens, these tax havens, and it attracts money.\n\nIt was Upton Sinclair who once said, it is difficult to get a man to understand something when his salary depends upon his not understanding it. In a given year, the Delaware franchise generates roughly $2 billion for the state. For a big state like New York or California, that would be a rounding error. But for tiny Delaware, that represents about one third of government revenues. That's one reason that Delaware levies no state or local sales taxes. And then there are all the jobs for lawyers, paralegals, administrative assistants, notaries, and all the other jobs supported by the money those people spend. So it's easy to see why Delaware has little incentive to impose transparency regulations or other regulations that might undercut its franchise, especially because they're lucky to have the franchise in the first place.\n\nHere's how Weitzman, again,\n\nDelaware didn't win this industry because it had a better business model. It won it by picking it up from New Jersey who bowed out.\n\nThis requires a brief history lesson.\n\nSo in 1888, New Jersey allowed holding companies where one company owns another, and then that decade after that, they relaxed the rules a lot on corporate structures and what they could do. So by 1911, this had attracted a lot of corporations to set up in New Jersey, and the franchise tax accounted for about a third of their state revenue.\n\nThat's the same share Delaware has today.\n\nAnd other states, including Delaware, copied them, but they just couldn't get market share until the election of 1913, when there was this interesting three-way contest for the presidency between Taft, who was the incumbent? Woodrow Wilson was the Democrat, and Teddy Roosevelt was the progressive candidate. And a big issue in that election was how to regulate corporations. And Teddy Roosevelt attacked Wilson in public saying, you haven't reigned in the companies in your own state. How are you gonna do that in the United States? He was rattled by this. And when Wilson won the election, he went home to New Jersey, fired up in his lame duck session, his allies in the state legislature introduced a bill to band holding companies, plus a host of other measures.\n\nAnd the corporations fled New Jersey and Delaware, which had copied their law, was there to welcome them with open arms. Delaware's very aware of this history and it wants to make sure that it doesn't do anything to jeopardize this source of revenue as New Jersey did. And it's always aimed to stay ahead of any competitors by making itself as business friendly as possible.\n\nAre there any campaigns either overt or covert to steal the franchise from Delaware? Perhaps you, Hal and your book are part of some stealth campaign by some other state. I mean, your book is published by Princeton University Press, which is located in New Jersey. Well,\n\nI should say, first of all, I'm not paid by any state to provide any kind of services of that nature.\n\nThere\n\nHave been some attempts, Nevada is one state that has attempted to win this business. And Wyoming another state that has attempted to win this business. How does they do it? By sort of being a cut price version of the real thing. They're kind of the private label Kohler, you know, and like private label Kohler. Some people like it, but most people don't. What\n\nAbout South Dakota? They show up in this realm now and again, don't they?\n\nYeah. In the 1980s there was an interesting battle between South Dakota and Delaware to win the admiration of financial institutions. South Dakota was the first state, I believe to say we'll get rid of interest rate caps for credit card companies. And there was a great concern at the time in Delaware that the credit card companies would just go South Dakota. And so they invited in two of the biggest Wall Street names to rewrite their financial rules. And they did it in private, of course, 'cause it's Delaware, nothing is public. It was all very secret. And then they introduced them to the legislature in the late afternoon, said you got three hours to approve these. And nobody of course could understand what the hell they were reading.\n\nSo it all got voted through and that's how the credit card companies ended up in Delaware. But South Dakota was able to win the trust business. If you look at how much the trust business is worth to South Dakota is negligible. It's basically nothing because there aren't as many trusts, right? Whereas companies, they're all 1.8 million of them. It's a volume business is kind of, you know, stack 'em high and sell 'em cheap.\n\nBut also Weitzman admits Delaware has become so good at being Delaware that the other places just can't compete.\n\nSo most people go for the real thing. You know, being a Delaware company means something. It's hard to recreate the reputation. It's hard to recreate things like the Chancery Court.\n\nComing up after the break, we will hear about the Chancery Court, perhaps the most special feature of the Delaware franchise.\n\nI do sit on a high bench with a rob on, fortunately we don't do wigs.\n\nI'm Steven Dubner. This is Freakonomics Radio. We will be right back. Okay, we promised we would tell you about one of the most special features of Delaware's massive legal industrial complex.\n\nMy name is Travis Laster and I'm here today because I'm a member of the Delaware Court of Chancery.\n\nAnd what is the Court of Chancery?\n\nWell, there's a short answer and the long answer. The short answer is we are one of the three constitutional courts of Delaware. We are best known as perhaps the nation's preeminent venue for deciding business disputes. The longer answer is that we're a court of equity, and I'd be happy to spell that out if you wanna hear the long story. Let's\n\nHear the medium story.\n\nSure. So a court of equity is an artifact of really the Middle Ages legal system in Britain. If you think back to the 13 hundreds, the reign of King Edward, the legal system in England had gotten very, very formal and fixed. They would only let you file a case if you could fill out a form called a writ and fill in the blanks precisely. Well, if you were a wealthy member of the nobility, you had another recourse. And that was that you could go to the king and the king had something better than the courts. He had soldiers so he could send out his soldiers.\n\nAnd regardless of what the court said, his soldiers could either make you do something or they could make you stop doing something. So what happened was privileged people would access the king, and the king got tired of hearing these petitions. But our kings in England had a right hand man, and he was the Chancellor.",

      "transcript_chunk": ", you can watch as many YouTube wi videos as you want. You're not gonna learn the guitar. You have to put your fingers on the strings to actually learn the motions. And I think there is a parallel here to programming where programming has to be learned in part by the actual typing.\n\nI'm just really, this is, this is fascinating. Listen, part of my brain agrees with you. A hundred percent part doesn't, I think AI should be in the loop of learning. Now current systems don't do that, but I think it's very possible for cursor to say, to basically force you to type certain things. So like if you set the mode of learning, I just, I don't want to be this sort of give up on ai. I really, I think, I think Vibe coding is a skill. So for an experienced programmer's too easy to dismiss Vibe coding as a thing.\n\nI\n\nAgree, I wouldn't dismiss it.\n\nBut I think you need to start building that skill and start to figure out how do you prevent the competency from slipping away from your fingers and brain. Like how do you develop that skill in parallel to the other, to the other skill? I don't know, I just, it's, I think it's a fascinating puzzle though. I know too many really strong programmers that just kind of avoid the ai 'cause it's currently a little too dumb.\n\nYes, it's a little too slow is actually my main problem. It's a little too dumb in some ways, but it's a little too slow in other ways. When I use Claude's code, the terminal version of a clo, which is actually my preferred way of using it, I just, I get too impatient. It feels like I'm going back to a time where code had to compile and I had to go do something else, a boil some tea while the code is compiling. Well, I've been working in Ruby for 20 years. I don't have compiled weight in me anymore. So there's that aspect of it. But I think the more crucial aspect for me is I really care about the competence. And I've seen what happens to even great programmers the moment they put away the keyboard.\n\nBecause even before ai, this would happen as soon as people would get promoted. Most great programmers who work in large businesses stop writing code on a daily basis because they simply have too many meetings to attend to. They have too many other things to do do. And invariably they lose touch with programming. That doesn't mean they forget everything, but if you don't have your fingers in the sauce source, you are going to lose touch with it. There's just no other way. I don't want that because I enjoy it too much. This is not just about outcomes. This is what's crucial to understand programming for programmers who like to code is not just about the programs they get out of it.\n\nThat may be the economic value. It's not the only human value. The human value is just s much in the expression. When someone who sits down on a guitar and plays stairways to heaven, there's a perfect recording of that that will last in eternity. You can just put it on Spotify. You don't actually need to do it. The joy is to command the guitar yourself. The joy of the programmer of me as a programmer is to type the code myself. If I elevate myself, if I promote myself out of programming, I turn myself into a project manager, a project manager of a murder of AI crows. As I wrote the other day, I could have been become a project manager my whole career.\n\nI could have become a project manager 20 years ago if I didn't care to write code myself. And I just wanted outcomes. That's how I got started in programming. I just wanted outcomes. Then I fell in love with programming and now I'd rather retire than giving it up. Now that doesn't mean you can't have your cake and needed to. I've done some Vibe coding where I didn't care that I wasn't playing myself. I just wanted to see something. There was an idea in my head. I wanted to see something. That's fine. I also use AI all day long. In fact, I'm already at the point where if you took it away from me, I'd be like, oh my God, how do we even look things up on the internet anymore? Is is stack overflow still around forum still a thing?\n\nLike how do I even find answers to some of these questions I have all day long? I don't wanna give up ai. In fact, I'd say the way I like to use ai, I'm getting smarter every day because of ai, because I'm using AI to have it explain things to me. Even stupid questions. I would be a little embarrassed to even enter into Google. AI is perfectly willing to give me the ELI five explanation of some Unix command. I should have known already, but I don't, I'm sorry, can you just explain it to me and now I know the thing. So at the end of the day of me working with AI all day long, I'm a little bit smarter. Like 5%, sorry, not 5%, half a percent maybe that compounds over time.\n\nBut what I've also seen, when I worked on the KU project and I tried to let AI drive for me, I felt I was maybe half a percent dumber at the end of the day.\n\nOkay. You said a lot of interesting things. First of all, let's just start at the very fact that asking dumb questions, if you Go to Stack overflow and ask a dumb question or read somebody else's dumb question and the answer to it, there's a lot of judgment there. Yes. AI sometimes to an excessive degree has no judgment. It usually says, oh, that's a great question.\n\nTo a fault.\n\nYeah. Oh, that's wonderful. Yeah, I, I mean it's, it's such a, it's so conducive to learning. It's such a wonderful tool for learning and I would, I too would miss it. And it's a great, basically search engine into all kinds of nuances of a particular programming language, especially if you don't know it that well or like APIs you can load in documentation. It's just so great for learning. I, for me personally, it, I mean, on the happiness scale, it makes me more excited to program. I don't know what that is exactly. Part of that is the, I'm really sorry. Stack Overflow is an incredible website, but there is a negativity there.\n\nYeah, there's a judgment there. There's, it's just exciting to be out like a, with a hype man next to me, just like saying, yeah, that's a great idea. And I'll say, no, that's wrong. I'll, I'll correct the AI and, and the AI will say, you're absolutely right. How did I not think about that? You know, rewrite the code. I'm like, holy shit, I'm having, that's like a buddy. That's like really being positive and is very smart and is challenging me to think. And even if I never use the code it generates, I'm already a better programmer. But actually the deeper thing is for some reason I'm having more fun. That's a really, really important thing. I\n\nLike to think of it as a pair programmer for exactly that reason. Pair programming came a vogue in like the two thousands where you'd have two programmers in front of one machine and you push the keyboard between you. One program would be driving, it'd be typing in. The other programmer would essentially sit and watch the code, suggest improvements, look something up. That was a really interesting dynamic. Now, unfortunately, I'm an introvert, so I can do that for about five minutes. Yeah. Before I wanna jump off a bridge so it doesn't work for me as a full-time occupation. But AI allows me to have all the best of that experience all the time. Now I think what's really interesting, what you said about it makes it more fun. I hadn't actually thought about that, but what it's made more fun to me is to be a beginner.\n\nAgain, it's made me, it's made it more fun to learn, bash successfully for the first time. Now I had to do the detour where I let it write all the code for me and I realized I wasn't learning nearly as much as I hoped I would and that I started doing once I typed it out myself. But it gave me the confidence that, you know what, if I need to do some iOS programming myself, I haven't done that in probably six years was the last time I dabbled in it. I never really built anything for real. I feel highly confident now that I could sit down with AI and I could have something in the app store by the end of the week. I would not have that confidence unless I had a pair of programming body like ai. I don't actually use it very much for Ruby Code.\n\nI'm occasionally impressed whenever I try it, they're like, oh, it got this one thing right. That is truly remarkable and it's actually pretty good. Yeah. And then I'll ask you two more questions and I go like, yeah, okay. If you were my junior programmer, I'd start tapping my fingers and going like, you gotta, you gotta shape up. Now the great thing of course is we can just wait five minutes. The Entropic CEO seems to think that 90% of all code by the end of the year is gonna be written by ai. I am more than a little bit skeptical about that, but I'm open-minded about the prospect that programming potentially will turn into a horse when done manually. Something we do recreationally is no longer a mode of transportation to get around la You're not gonna saddle up and Go to the grocery store and pick up stuff from Whole Foods in your Saddlebacks.\n\nThat's just not a thing anymore. That could be the future for programming, for manual programming entirely possible. I also don't care, like even though we have great renditions of all the best songs, as I said, there are millions of people who love to play the guitar. It may no longer have as much economic value as it once did. I think that I'm quite convinced is true that we perhaps have seen the peak. Now I understand the paradox, when the price of something goes down, actually the U overall usage goes up and total spend on that activity goes up. That could also happen maybe. But what we're seeing right now is that a lot of the big shops, a lot of the big companies are not hiring like they were five years ago.\n\nThey're not anticipating they're gonna need tons more programmers. Controversially. Toby actually put out a memo inside of Shopify asking everyone who's considering hiring someone to ask the question, could this be done by ai? Now, he's further ahead on this question than I am. I look at some of the coding trenches and I go like, I'd love to use AI more, and I see how it's making us more productive, but it's not yet at the level where I just go like, oh, we have this project. Lemme just give it to the AI agent and it's gonna go off and do it. But let's\n\nJust, let's just be honest. You're like a clone Eastwood type character cowboy on a, on a horse seeing, seeing cars going around and you're like, well,\n\nThat's part of it. And I think that's, it is important to have that humility that what you are good at may no longer be what society values. This has happened a million times in history that you could been exceptionally good at saddle making, for example. That's something that a lot of people used to care about because everyone rode a horse and then suddenly riding a horse became this niche hobby that there's some people care about it, but not nearly as many. That's okay. Now the other thing of this is I've had the good fortune to been a programmer for nearly 30 years. That was a great run. I try to look at life in this way that I've already been blessed with decades of economically viable, highly valuable ways of translating what I like best in the working world to write Ruby Code, that that was so valuable that I could make millions and millions of dollars doing it.\n\nAnd if that's over tomorrow, I shouldn't look at that with regret. I should look at it with gratitude.\n\nBut you're also a highly experienced, brilliant and opinionated human being, so it's really interesting to get your opinion on the future of the horse because it, you know, there's a lot of young people listening to this who love programming or who are excited by the possibility of building stuff with software, with a Ruby, with Ruby, with Ruby on Rails, that kind of language this and now the possibility. But is it\n\nA career?\n\nIs it a career? And how, if indeed a single person can build more and more and more with the help of ai, like how do they learn that skill? Is this a good skill to learn? I mean, that to me is the real mystery here because I think it's still absolutely true that you have to learn how to program from scratch currently. Yes. But how do you balance those two skills? Because I too, as I'm thinking now, there is a scary slipping away of skill that happens in a matter of like really minutes on a particular piece of code. It just, it's, it's, it's scary. Not the way driving, you know, when you have a car drive for you doesn't quite slip away that fast.\n\nSo that really scares me. So when, when somebody comes up to me and asks me like, how do I learn to program, I don't know what the advice is because I think it's not enough to just use cursor or copilot to generate code.\n\nIt's absolutely not enough. Not if you wanna learn, none of you want to become better at it. If you just become a tap mum monkey, maybe you're productive in a second. But then you have to realize, well, can anyone just tap if that's all we're doing is just sitting around all day long tapping? Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes. That's not a marketable skill. Now, I always preface this both to myself and when I speak to others about it, is rule number note one, nobody fucking knows anything. No one can predict even six months ahead. Right now, we're probably at peak ai future hype because we see all the promise, because so much of it is real and so many people have experienced it themselves. This mind boggling thing that the silicon is thinking in some way that feels eerily reminiscent of humans.\n\nI'd actually say the big thing for me wasn't even chat GBT, it wasn't even clawed. It was deep seek running, deep seek locally and seeing the think box where it converses with itself about how to formulate the response. I almost want to think, is this a gimmick? Is it doing this as a performance for my benefit? But that's not actually how it thinks. If this is how it actually thinks. Okay, I'm a little scared. Yeah, this is incredibly human, how it thinks in this way. Yeah, but where does that go? So in 95, 1 of my favorite movies, one of my favorite B movies, came out The Lawnmower Man. Great movie.\n\nIncredible movie about virtual reality. Yeah. Being an avatar and living in vr, like the story was a mess. But the aesthetics, the world, that buildup was incredible. And I thought, we're five years away. I'm gonna be living in VR now. I'm just gonna be floating around. I'm gonna be an avatar. This is where most humans can spend most of the day that didn't happen. We're 30 years later, VR is still not here. It's here for gaming, it's here for some specialized applications. My oldest loves playing Gorilla tag. I dunno if you've tried that. That's basically the hottest VR game. Wonderful. That's great. It's really hard to predict the future 'cause we just don't know.\n\nAnd then when you factor into AI and you have even the smartest people go like, I don't think we fully understand how this works.\n\nBut then on the flip side, you have Moore's Law that seems to have worked for many, many, many years in decreasing the size of transistor, for example. Yes. So like, you know, flash didn't take over the internet, but Moore's law law worked. So yes, we don't know which one AI is, which\n\nOne it is. And this is what I find so fascinating too. I forget who did this presentation, but someone in the web community, this great presentation on the history of the airplane. So you go from the Wright brothers flying in, what is it, 1903 or something like that, and 40 years later you have a jet flight. Just an unbelievable amount of progress in four decades. Then in 56, I think it was the halt design for the Boeing 7 47 century precursor was designed and basically nothing has happened since. Just minor tweaks and improvements on the flying experience since the fifties.\n\nSomehow, if you were to predict where flying was gonna go, and you were sitting in 42 and you'd seen, you'd remember the Wright brothers flying in oh three and you were seeing that jet engines coming, you're like, we're gonna fly to to the stars in another two decades.",

      "transcript_chunk": "column you want to insert values, parentheses, every value that fits with that column. It gets tedious to write sequel by hand, but it's actually very humanly readable. Active record just takes that tediousness away.\n\nIt makes it possible to combine things in a way that a humanly describable language just doesn't. It composes things into methods and you can combine these methods and you can build structures around them. So I don't dislike sql, I dislike a lot of things in programming. I try to get rid of them. SQL wasn't really one of them, it was just a sense of I don't wanna write the same thing over and over again. It was a, can we be a little more succinct? Can we match it just slightly better to the object orientation without trying to hide away the fact that we're persisting these objects into a database. That's where I think a lot of ORMs went wrong. They tried to live in the pure world of objects, never to consider that.\n\nThose objects had to be consistent into a SQL database. And then they came up with convoluted way of translating back and forth. Active record says, do you know what? Just accept it. This record, this object is not gonna get saved into some no SQL database. It's not gonna be saved, it's gonna be saved into SQL database. So it's just structured the whole thing around that. It's gonna have attributes, those attributes are gonna respond to columns in the database. It's not more complicated than that stuff making it so, yeah,\n\nBut I, I should say, so I personally love SQL because I'm an algorithm person and so I love optimization. I love to know how the databases actually work so I can match the SQL queries and the design of the table such that there is, you know, optimal squeeze the optimal performance out of the table table. Okay. Based on the actual way that that table is used. So I mean I, I think that pushes to the point that like there is value in learning, in understanding sql. I I wonder because I, I started looking at active record and it looks really awesome. Does that make you lazy? Not you, but a person that rolls in and starts using Rails, you can probably get away with never really learning sequel.\n\nRight.\n\nAs long as you wanna stay at the entry level of competence. And this is actually my overarching mission with Rails is to lower the barrier of entry so far down that someone can start seeing stuff on their browser without basically understanding anything. Yeah, they can run rail's, new blog, run a couple of generators, they have a whole system, they don't understand anything, but it's an invitation to learn more. Where I get fired up, and this ties back to the AI discussion, is when that's turned into this meme that programmers no longer have to be competent. They can just, I mean the AI's gonna figure it out. The generators is gonna figure it out. I don't need to know Sequel active record is gonna abstract it away from me.\n\nNo, no, no dude, hold up the path here is competence. I'm trying to teach you things. I understand. I can't teach you everything in five minutes. No one who's ever become good at anything worthwhile could be taught everything in five minutes. If you wanna be a fully well-rounded web application developer that takes years, but you can actually become somewhat productive in a few days. You can have fun in a few days for sure. You gonna have fun in a a few minutes. In a few hours. And over time I can teach you a little more active record says like, yeah, yeah. Alright, start to here and then like next week we'll do a class on sequel.\n\nAnd actually you have this beautiful expression that I love that a great programming language like Ruby has a soft ramp a go, the ramp goes to Infinity. That's\n\nExactly right.\n\nSo you, yeah, it's super accessible, super easy to get started\n\nAnd it never stops. Yeah, it never, there's always more to learn. This is one of the reasons I'm still having fun programming, that I'm still learning new things. I can still incorporate new things. The web is deep enough as a domain. You're never gonna learn all of it.\n\nProvide sharp knives.\n\nThis is a good one because another way of saying this, the opposite way of saying this, the Java way of saying is do not provide foot guns, right? Yeah. I don't wanna give you sharp knives. You're a child, you can't handle a sharp knife. Here's a dull butter knife, cut your damn steak. Right? That's a very frustrating experience. You want a sharp knife even though you might be able to cut yourself. I trust humans in the same way that Matts trust humans. Maybe you cut off a finger. Alright, you're not gonna do that again. Thankfully it was a virtual think finger. It's gonna grow back out. Your competence is gonna grow. It's more fun to work with sharp tools\n\nAnd that actually contributes to the the ramp that goes to Infinity. Yes.\n\nTo the learning value\n\nIntegrated systems.\n\nWe kind of hit on that one. This is Rails is trying to solve the whole problem of the web, not just one little component. It's not leaving you a bunch of pieces. You have to put together yourself\n\nProgress over stability.\n\nYou know what, if there's one that's dated, it's probably that one It at this stage Rails has been incredibly stable over many, many generations. The last major release Rails eight was basically a no up upgrade for anyone running Rail seven. Rail seven was almost a no up upgrade for anyone running rail six. I used to think it required more churn to get progress to stay on the leading edge of new stuff. And I wrote this before I experienced the indignity of the 2010s in the JavaScript community where it seemed like stability was not just unvalued, it was actually despised that churn in and off itself was a value we should be pursuing.\n\nDid you, if you were still working with the same framework three months later you were an idiot And I saw that and I actually recoiled and if I was gonna write the doctrine today, I'd write that differently. I wouldn't say progress over stability.\n\nWell maybe the, it'd be a function of the the age of the programming language also\n\nMaybe or a deeper understanding of the problem. I think part of what's so fascinating about technology is that we have this perception that everything constantly moves so fast. No it doesn't. Everything moves at a glacial pace. There is occasionally a paradigm shift like what's happening with AI right now. Like what ha happened with the introduction of the iPhone in 2007, like what happened with the internet in 95. That's basically the total sum of my career. Three things changed. Everything else in between was incremental small improvements. You can recognize a rails application written in 2003.\n\nI know because the Basecamp I wrote back then is still operating, making millions of dollars in a RR servings in customers on the initial version that was launched back then. And it looks like the rails code if I squint a little that I would write today. So most things don't change even in computing. And that's actually a good thing we saw with the JavaScript ecosystem. What happens when everyone gets just mad about constant churn? Things don't change that often. By\n\nThe way, on that small tangent, you just sort of visibly, verbally changed your mind with the you of 15 years ago. Yes. That's interesting. Have you, have you noticed yourself changing your mind quite a bit over the years?\n\nI would say, oh yes. And then also, oh no, in the sense that there are absolutely fundamental things both about human nature, about institutions, about programming, about business that I've changed my mind on. And then I've also had experiences that are almost even more interesting where I thought I had changed my mind and I tried it a new way, realized why I had the original opinion in the first place and then gone back to it. So it happens both ways. The an example of the later part for example was managers at 37 signals. For the longest time I would rail against engineering managers as an unnecessary burden on a small or even medium sized company.\n\nAnd at one point I actually started doubting myself a little bit. I started thinking like, do you know what maybe all programmers do need a one-on-one therapy session every week with their engineering manager to be a whole individual. So we tried that for a couple years where we hired some very good engineering managers who did engineering management the way you're supposed to do it, the way it's done all over the place. And after that I thought like, no, no, I was right. This was correct. We should not have had managers. Not every programmer needs a therapy session with an engineering manager every week. We don't need these ly scheduled huddles, we don't need all these meetings. We just need to leave people the hell alone to work on problems that they enjoy for long stretches of uninterrupted time.\n\nThat is where happiness is found, that's where Productivity is found. And if you can get away with it, you absolutely should. Engineering management is a necessary evil. When that breaks down, what's\n\nThe case for managers then?\n\nThe case for managers is that if you do have a lot of people, there's a bunch of work that kind of just crops up. The one-on-one is one example that programmers need someone to check in with. There's another idealized version that someone needs to guide the career of juniors, for example, to give them redirecting feedback and all this other stuff. And it's not that in the abstract, I don't agree with some of those things, but in practice I've found that they often create more problems that they solve. And a good example here is can you get feedback from someone who's not better at your job than you are? You get some feedback, you can get feedback on how you show up at work. Are you being courteous to others?\n\nAre you being a good communicator? Okay, yes. But you can't get feedback on your work and that's more important. It's more important that you work under and with someone who's better at your job than you are if you wish to progress in your career. And every single programmer I've ever worked with was far more interested in progressing in their career on that metric, getting better at their craft than they were in picking up pointers that a middle manager could teach them. That's not saying that there isn't value in it, it's not saying there isn't value in being a better person or a better communicator. Of course there is all those things, but if I have to choose one or the other, I value competence higher. Like that's again a ca this a million times because I know what people sometimes hear, they hear the genius asshole is just fine and that's great and you should excuse all sorts of malicious behavior if someone's just really good at what they do.\n\nI'm not saying that at all. What I am saying is that the history of competence is a history of learning from people who are better than you and that relationship should take precedence over all else and that relationship gets put aside a bit when engineering managers introduced. Now the funny thing is this conversation ties back to the earlier things we were talking about. Most engineering managers are actually former programmers. They at least no program to some extent, but what I've seen time and again is that they lose their touch, their feel with it very, very quickly and turn into pointy haired bosses very, very quickly who are really good at checking for updates.\n\nJust seeing where we are on project A here if you need anything or we ready to deliver to, okay, yes. And also, no, shut up, leave me the hell alone. Lemme program and then I'll come up for air, I'll talk with other programmers who I can spar with that we can learn something with. I can turn the problems over with and we can move forward. If you look back on the history of computer industry, all the great innovation that's happened, it's all been done by tiny teams with no engineering managers, just full of highly skilled individuals. You've had John Karmic on here. I used to look up to its offers so much, not just because I loved quick, not just because I loved what they were doing, but because he shared a bit about how the company worked.\n\nThere were no managers or maybe they had one business guy doing some business stuff, but that was just to get paid. Everything else was basically just designers and programmers and there were about eight of them and they created a goddamn quake two. So why do you need all these people again? Why do you need all these managers again? I think again, at a certain scale it does break down. It's hard to just have a hundred thousand programmers running around wild without any product mommies or daddies telling them what to do. I understand that and then even as I say that, I also don't understand it. Yeah, because if you look at something like Gmail for example, there was like a side project done by at Google at the time, so much of the enduring long-term value of even all these huge companies were created by people who didn't have a goddamn manager.\n\nAnd that's not an accident, that's a direct cause and effect. So I've turned in some way even more militant over the years against this notion of management, at least for myself and knowing who I am and how I wanna work. Because the other part of this is I don't want to be manager and maybe this is just me projecting the fact that I'm an introvert who don't like to talk to people on one-on-one calls every week. But it also encapsulates how I was able to progress my career. I did not really Go to the next level with Ruby or otherwise until I had a door I could close and no one could bother me for six hours straight.\n\nSo in companies probably one of the reasons is it's very easy to hire managers and managers also delegate responsibility from you. So if if you just have a bunch of programmers running around, you're kind of respons like it's, it's it's work, it's intellectual work to have to deal with the the first principles of every problem that's going on. Yes, so managers like you can like relax, oh I'll be taken care of, but they then hire their own managers and it just multiplies and multiplies and multiplies. I would love it if some of the great companies would have in the United States, if there was like an extra side branch that we could always run, maybe physicists can come up how to split the simulation to where just all the managers are removed.\n\nAlso just with just just in that branch, just the PR and the comms people also and even the lawyers, just engineers and let's just see and then we merge it back.\n\nI've essentially run that branch at 37 singles for 20 years and I've experimented with forking back on the other side. I've experimented with having a full-time lawyer on staff. I've experimented with having engineering managers and I can tell you life is much better at 50, 60 people when none of those individuals or none of those roles. It's never about the individuals, it's about the roles. None of those roles are in your organization full time. Occasionally you need a manager, occasionally you need a lawyer. I can play the role of manager occasionally fine and then I can set it back down to zero. It's almost like the like a cloud surface. I wanna manage your service. I can call on for seven hours this week and then I wanna take it down to zero for the next three months.\n\nYeah. I\n\nRead, I don't know if this is still the case, that Basecamp is an LLC and doesn't have a CFO, like a full-time accountant. Is that,\n\nDid you guys, that's funny. Is these days we do have a head of finance. We did not for the first 19 years of life, I think we got away with basically just having an accountant do our books in the same way you would do a small ice cream shop, except we would over time have done hundreds of millions of dollars in revenue. The scale seemed quirky and at some point you can also fall in love with your own quirkiness to a degree that isn't actually healthy.",

      "transcript_chunk": "many home runs I was sitting on then.\n\nThat's Jackson himself from the film. Now, he had just completed his senior season of college football, which had gone even better. Dave O'Connor, again,\n\nFootball. His senior year is one of the all time great seasons of a running back in college football. He rushes for nearly 1800 yards. He wins the Heisman Trophy and basically enshrines himself as a legend of college football. Sort of the common wisdom was that Bo will be the number one draft pick in football. He will probably not play baseball at all. And if he does, somebody should pick him in the 20th round or 30th round on a flyer just in case,\n\nRight? You don't wanna waste a pick on a guy who's gonna be playing football, right? So while finishing up his college baseball career, Jackson starts getting courted by NFL teams. The football draft happens before the baseball draft. The number one overall NFL pick is held by the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, who are owned by a man named Hugh Culverhouse. The Bucks have made it clear that they want Bo Jackson.\n\nI was all Gog Ho and I had taken a few trips to visit some teams. My senior year I got the okay to go visit Tampa Bay. Hugh Culverhouse sent his jet to Columbus Airport, drove over, got on the jet, went to Tampa Bay for my visit. It was almost like a college visit when you're a high school senior and you're going to visit a college and they get some of the players to show you around town to show you the night spots, take you to a nice restaurant and entertain you. About four or five days later, I'm back at Auburn getting ready for my baseball game.\n\nAnd I walked out on the field. I have to walk from the athletic department across the parking lot across the street to the baseball field. And as I get to the gate to come around the dugout, coach Baird approaches me. He said, Bo, can I talk to you for a second? I said, sure, coach. He said, let's go. We're behind the dugout. Let's go sit and talk. So we go behind the dugout and I'm thinking that he's gonna tell me, Hey, some big league team wants to sign me. And he said, did you take a trip last week on Hugh cover house's jet to go down to visit Tampa? I said, yes. And the folks checked and said that it was okay.\n\nThey checked with the NC and said that it was okay to do that. He said, well Bo someone, somebody didn't check. And the NTAA has declared you ineligible for any more college sports, so you can't play baseball no more. And I sit there on that ground and I cried like a baby. I cried like a baby.\n\nBo Jackson immediately felt that he'd been wronged. He loved baseball. And even though it looked like he was going to play football professionally, he was distraught about being barred from finishing out his college baseball career. And what's more, he became convinced that Hugh Culverhouse, the Tampa Bay owner, had done this to Beau on purpose\n\nBecause the officials at Tampa Bay told me personally, yes, we checked and they said that it was okay. I think it was all a plot now just to get me ineligible from baseball. 'cause they saw the season that I was having and they thought that they were gonna lose me to baseball. And if we declare an ineligible, then we got it.\n\nNow, we don't know whether the bucks actually meant for this to happen, but it certainly did seem to work out well for them. They were in line to pick Bo Jackson, number one in the NFL draft and pay him so much money that he'd forget about baseball in a heartbeat. It was just one problem. Bo Jackson isn't the forgetting type.\n\nAnd I said, there is no way I'm signing with Tampa Bay. And I told Hugh Cover House, I said, you draft me if you want it, you gonna waste a draft pick. I said, I promise you that. And Hugh cover house. Well, this is what I'm gonna offer you as a signing bonus and you're gonna take it and whether you want it or not. I said, all right. They didn't think I was serious. And I sat down after baseball season was over, I talked to my baseball coach. I said, coach, a lot of people don't think I'm serious about playing baseball. I said, but if Tampa Bay drafts me, I said, on my honor, and I'm looking, you in your eye man to man, I'm playing baseball.\n\nSo if you know any teams out there that's interested in an outfielder, you let 'em know.\n\nIn the NFL draft that April Tampa Bay did select Bo Jackson with the number one pick, which was attached to a $7.66 million five, five-year contract. And then a couple of months later, Bo Jackson was selected in the baseball draft in the fourth round by the Kansas City Royals. They offered him three years, years at just $1 million. The choice would seem obvious, but Bo doesn't know obvious. He rejects a football offer and he takes the baseball offer. How surprising is this? Here's Dave O'Connor again,\n\nUnprecedented. It just doesn't happen. You, you can't, I mean, money talks, right? I mean you, you have $7.6 million sitting there and you sign a contract for one. That's a rare occurrence.\n\nIt sounds like a decision that very few people that I know at least would've made. Do you think that was an act of spite on Bo Jackson's part?\n\nIt's interesting because I think Bo would say that he did the honorable thing and that he has a code. But when you look at it on its surface, it is spite. There is no rational explanation for walking away from that kind of money. He's not just hurting himself here. He's also doing this to hurt Tampa Bay. To some extent, the opportunity cost of losing a first round draft pick isn't just that Bo Jackson isn't playing on my team. It's that every other player I could have selected with that pick is not playing on my team either. So it's a huge impact to Tampa Bay, not to mention the public relations nightmare of of going out on a limb and selecting somebody and not getting him.\n\nSo Jackson does sign with the Royals. He starts the year in the minor leagues, but by the end of the season he makes a major league team. He's on track for a nice baseball career, and then the next year he becomes eligible to reenter football. Now will he play? Nobody knows. But the Los Angeles Raiders draft him in the seventh round. He signs and suddenly he's playing two professional sports. At the end of the baseball season, he jumps straight into football and he became a star in both. He also becomes a household name in part because of his athletic feats. And in part because he was the star of one of the most beguiling ad campaigns in history.\n\nBo knows for Nike,\n\nBo knows baseball. Bo knows football. Bo knows basketball too.\n\nBo could surf. Bo could roller Blade Bo could not play ice hockey. That was the one thing that they couldn't, they they couldn't agree to let him actually be able to do. Gretzky shakes his head and says\n\nNo,\n\nBut pretty much everything else, volleyball, tennis, running, lifting, weights, aerobics, all kinds of stuff.\n\nBo, you don't know Didley.\n\nAlright, so we agree that Bo Jackson's athletic career turned out pretty well, remarkable on some dimensions, but overall not one of the greatest ever because it wasn't long enough. Perhaps we agree that because he was such an unusual athlete into sports, he became this icon and the focus of a remarkable and probably quite remunerative ad campaign, right? We agree on this so far. Yes. Do we therefore agree that had this catastrophe not happened with him, with getting drafted for the NFL by a team that out of spite or something like spite he turned down that if that had not happened, that all the rest may not have happened?\n\nYeah, I think that's a plausible argument to make because he probably had, he signed that deal with Tampa Bay, if he doesn't get injured, he probably becomes one of the best running backs in NFL history. But that's probably\n\nIt. I mean, honestly, my takeaway lesson here is spite pays.\n\nYeah, you would say, I mean if you take a look at where he ends up despite certainly paid in his case.\n\nSo here's a question we're thinking about. If spite indeed exists, is it something that we humans have always carried around in our genetic code? Or do we pick it up along the way?\n\nWe are constantly wrestling with our conscience and with a tendency to deviate from social norms in a risky way and to do wrong, to be selfish.\n\nThat's coming up after the break.

So is spite an innate part of being human or is it something we learn?\n\nWe're a very biological organism and we've inherited an awful lot. In fact, most of the basic emotions that guide us from our animal and paleolithic early human past\n\nThat is EO Wilson. He's a renowned biologist and author\n\nAnd that's Katherine Wells. She produced this episode and she interviewed EO Wilson for us back in 2013.\n\nI called him up because I wanted to know where all of this self-destructive spite comes from. You know, is this a common behavior throughout nature or are we unusual in it? And I have to say that I just assumed that we would be the meanest creatures in existence given everything we've heard today. But Wilson said that wasn't true.\n\nOh no, we only moderately mean.\n\nNow Eel Wilson has done a lot of thinking about the origins of human behavior and he thinks the nastiness that we see in animals might give us a clue to why we act the way we do.\n\nThere's a case that comes quickly to mind, for example, of a kind of spider in which the mother has a brood of spider lings and when they're born she sits down and, and lets the little spiralling eat her. There are a couple of cases in the ants where the workers have a huge gland of poisonous material containing it, and when they get into a tough fight, they are able to contract their abdomens and explode their abdomen so that the sticky poison covers the enemy. It can disable several enemies doing that by giving its life.\n\nThe list of this kind of behavior goes on and on.\n\nI mean things that you really don't want to think about too much before you go to sleep. You might have nightmares, but here's the story about spite. If we define spite as doing harm to someone else at the cost of harm to yourself, and that involves a surrender of some advantage or emotional reward on your part, you give it up in order to hurt somebody else that might not exist\n\nIn nature.\n\nIt's very difficult to find any case in the great encyclopedia of animal aggression where it doesn't give some advantage to the individual doing the aggression. But it's very rare that an animal would deliberately injure itself just in order to create injure in another individual without any further gain to itself. To deliberately do that, I think spite does not exist in the animal kingdom\n\nIn the way that it does in humans. Is that right?\n\nWell, let's take humans. When a person injures himself or herself, say in reputation, in diminishing wealth, causing their own early death, whatever it is, in order to harm another person, he would say, oh, that's spite. That's got to be spite. But it really would be true spite in my mind as opposed to mirror risk taking or trade off for one kind of gain in exchange for one kind of loss taken. If you can't see a gain, and that's hard to imagine, even vengeance has its gain.\n\nIt has a strong emotional award to it. For example, if you harm yourself in your reputation, you accept that if the damage you can do benefits you in some other way or benefits, say particularly your own offspring in a particular way, you know, like unscrupulous stage moms murderous of cheerleading champion competitors. I think you'll get the drift. Even a mass murderer who goes out and harms a lot of people is taking some benefit, emotional benefit from that when suicide is intended.\n\nA lot of mass murders are just a terrible form of suicide in which a person decides to get the satisfaction is vast of committing it, and maybe the satisfaction the person will get in striking out against something they imagine to be their enemy and diminish them before. So when you add that factor, maybe real spite does not exist.\n\nSo I don't know whether this is a relief or not. I mean, the idea that spite might not even exist seems good, but the fact that we get personal satisfaction out of hurting other people. I told Wilson that was kind of a bummer.\n\nThat just shows you're not a psychopath.\n\nI'm, I'm a, I'm a total woos. But here's the upside. Spite is not the only motivation we have for being self-destructive. There's actually another altruism. When we hurt ourselves, we aren't always doing it just to hurt someone else. Sometimes we're doing it to help.\n\nOne of the things that makes us human is our internally conflicted nature confliction our ambivalence to our own selves. We are constantly wrestling with our conscience and with a tendency to deviate from social norms in a risky way and to do wrong, to be selfish. The contest within us between doing the moral thing, even the heroic thing on one side and doing the selfish, perhaps even criminal thing on the other side, that contest is what gives us such a continuously conflicted nature.\n\nIf we became completely altruistic, then we would be like ants. If we went to the opposite extreme and had complete lack of constraint and it was complete individualism, then we would have chaos. We would not have order. The group would dissolve. So we have to be in the middle. This appears to be the human condition.\n\nIt's funny listening to him talk about that.\n\nThat's Steve Levitt again. He took a class with Wilson when he, Levitt was an undergrad at Harvard. He's very fond of the way Wilson thinks.\n\nThere could be no two disciplines closer than evolutionary biology and economics. And they studied different questions and they use different methods. But the way that evolutionary biologists thinks is exactly like the way that economists think. Both are very much a model of behavior, of individual behavior, an individual behavior that's motivated by costs and benefits. The other thing is that at its heart, both economics and evolutionary biology strive for simplicity. That the simplest story which can explain a set of facts is the one that we gravitate to as opposed to other disciplines. History history's all about complexity. Literature is all about complexity.\n\nEven sociology, I think at heart is about complexity. (1)",

      "transcript_chunk": "st laws passed by members of parliament. There's still a parliament which has the ability to pass new laws. I don't understand why that's clung to as if it's some natural physical\n\nLaw. I'm not, I'm not cling to it. It's important to state it because otherwise people might be under the misapprehension that it's our choice or it's our decision. Basically it would take an act of parliament. I don't wanna make trying to get an act of parliament past my sole focus. It would take years and you would also have a legal challenge from whom? Oh, well, from a member of the public that will decide this is not the right thing. If I decided tomorrow I wanted to do something radical\n\nLike send all your Benin bronzes back to somewhere. Although that's complicated too.\n\nI'll be taken to court for sure. I mean there's no question. So people need to factor that into the process too, and that's not me using that as an excuse. There isn't a legal framework for us to just do this in a straightforward way. I could spend my entire direct ship trying to fight this and get nowhere. You have to also think really carefully about the ramifications. Thinking back to when the pandemic began, the big anxiety was that lots of small museums across the UK would be forced to sell like the one star painting they had. There was huge anxiety that this was gonna trigger a wave of disposals. So I think a sane a way around it is to begin collaborating now, which we already do, but to actually do even more of that,\n\nIncluding I guess back when you were at the National Portrait Gallery, your co purchase of the Joshua Reynolds painting called Portrait of My, is that right? Yeah,\n\nThat's right. And that was very innovative when we did that two years ago, I learned that this portrait of my buy Reynolds, which is one of probably Reynolds most important portraits, was gonna be sold. It hung in Castle Howard for most of the last 200 years, and then it's been basically in a bang vault for 20 years. The value is 50 million. I knew that was probably impossible for the National Portrait Gallery to be able to raise 50 million. I also knew that the Getty really wanted to acquire this work, and the Getty is the richest museum in the world, and it made sense to me rather than have this fruitless competition where I knew eventually we would lose to actually work together.\n\nDid you end up paying for roughly half of that 50 million pounds?\n\nWe paid for half. We split it 50 50 from the British side. Lots of people said, this is a terrible idea. It's not gonna work. There's no precedent. I said to them, listen, do you want 50% or a hundred percent of nothing because that's your option basically. Now everyone's very happy and it's been on the walls of the National Portrait Gallery for two years, and then it will go to Los Angeles in time for the Olympics. The compromise of my spending half its time next to where it was painted in Reynolds studio and it's spending half its time facing the Pacific, which is where my comes from, and Los Angeles has the biggest community from the Pacific region outside those islands. I think that's kind of appropriate. Anyway, so that's a long-winded way of saying that you have to invent new models rather than battling one piece of legislation.\n\nI would rather work with the framework I have and use that to benefit as many people as possible. Yes, I think it would be wonderful to be able to show the Ben and Bronzes, for example, in the new museum moa, the new museum in Benin City that we collaborate with very actively. We've been working with them on a joint archeological activation that we fund. But I also know that there's people I've talked to who are of Nigerian origin that say, I'm torn because part of me would love to see the Ben and bronzes go back. But the only reason I had access to my source culture was by going to see them in the British Museum and therefore there is an argument for both.\n\nSo let's talk a bit more about the circumstances of the British museums. Benin bronzes specifically, I spoke with David from, who wrote a piece about this situation for the Atlantic a few years ago. He said, as the piece I wrote, predicted the whole thing has fallen apart, meaning repatriation of the bronzes, not from the British museum but from other museums, especially in Germany. He said the driver behind that was the German authorities. They sent back a lot which have vanished. They were delivered to the Nigerian federal state. Some are known to have gone to the oba, but what happened to them is totally unknown. You've talked about the plans for the museum to open and you're involved in that, but what do you say to someone who is concerned about repatriation not having the desired effect of having a second place of display, but rather going back into a private collection or being sold off.\n\nThat's the kind of panicky version of the story. So what are you shooting for?\n\nWe only lend things where they're on public display somewhere else, around either the country or around the world. I'm a museum person. I'm always excited when there's other museums to work with, new museums to work with when there's new museums being born. I think it's incumbent on established organizations and other museums to do whatever they can appropriately to support. Let's not be paternalistic. A lot of museums have their own collections, their own program, their own curatorial expertise. They may or may not want your help or your collaboration, so it has to be a two-way street. Just to give you an example of that, the Getty, they fund this incredible project we do at the C-S-M-V-S Museum in Mumbai, which we've been working on for 14 years now, where that museum, which is essentially focused on Indian heritage, we learn things from our collection, but also for the first time they've curated a show which is now on display at the British Museum, which is fantastic.\n\nAnd so I think all of these relationships need to be reciprocal in two ways.\n\nDoes this apply to the Elgin Marbles as well? What's the plan there?\n\nI wish I could give you some amazing world exclusive, but I can only talk about what's in the public domain.\n\nThat means there is a world exclusive to be given. You're just not\n\nGiven to me. No, no, but no, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm telling. It's actually funny how people always think there's some big mystery or secret and actually, so it's well known that there's an ongoing discussion. I think both parties, the British Museum and Greece, and it is quite funny that it's a museum dealing with a nation. It's not the British government and the Greek government talking, it's the British Museum and the Greek government talking. I think both parties would love to see progress. Again, basically all comes down to a piece of legislation. I'm sure that Greece would like to have them all back now, but it's not within our gift to do that. So the question is, okay, can we find a way where we could lend a proportion and Greece would send us some wonderful things and we can build this partnership, and that's the conversation that's taking place where that will end up.\n\nI don't know. I'm very hopeful. I'm always trying to find ways to collaborate and to pioneer, I suppose, and to invent new things.\n\nHere's one idea I've always thought is cute. I don't know if it's practical at all, but let's say you've got a contested object or set of objects like the Elgin Marbles, Benin bronzes. There are others. Well, just the British Museum or the British government, I guess sponsoring, paying for the daily or weekly or monthly flight of tourists from that place. Come see it, spend a day at the British Museum, a kind of handheld curated experience of, yes, we're keeping these things, parliament says we have to, but we also recognize that they are your heritage, and so we'd like to run this exchange program. You like that idea?\n\nYeah, I mean, yeah, I think\n\nYes. He says not meaning it at all.\n\nNo, no, it's definitely not a bad idea. It's definitely innovative, but it sounds ambitious and is trying to break through maybe a barrier. But what I would say is even getting people to the British Museum and London only gets you so far. And of course the great thing is we're free. We've always been free. That was again, Hanson's original stipulation. The fact that anyone in the world who is in London can visit the British Museum and see all these things for free is incredible. We had 6.5 million visitors last year. If you think about the number of people that have come and seen these objects over time, almost 275 years, that's kind of incredible. Then of course, it's also beholden on you to get beyond the museum, whether that's virtually digitally, whether that's sharing the collection around the UK with the most generous lender of all the major British national museums outside London, about 2000 objects.\n\nTo give you an example, 6.5 million visitors last year came to the British Museum in Bloomsbury. 8 million visitors outside London saw something from our collection. We have partnership galleries across the UK and then up to 2000 works are on loan all around the globe at any one time. It's a truly global network, and what's interesting is people just don't know that because it's not an obvious headline.\n\nComing up after the break, we will get to the more obvious headlines about the British Museum\n\nIn more challenging moments.

Let's go places.\n\nIn April of 1902, a man calling himself Jacob Richter wrote a letter to the director of the British Museum. It said, I begged to apply for a ticket of admission to the reading room of the British Museum. I came from Russia in order to study the land question. This land question had to do with whether private ownership of land should be allowed, and Jacob Richter was a pseudonym for Vladimir Lenin. Here's what Lenin said later about the British Museum's Library. It is a remarkable institution, especially that exceptional reference section.\n\nIt's an incredible space. Clearly it was models on the pantheon, but the amazing thing is this beautiful ceiling we're looking at is made of pap ache because anything heavier would probably collapse in on itself. It's an incredible piece of architecture and of Victorian engineering.\n\nMatt again is Nicholas Cullinan, the director of the British Museum. He and I are standing in the middle of the round reading room, which was completed in 1857. It is a massive expanse with that domed ceiling with very tall bookshelves lining the circumference and rows of wooden desks laid out like spokes on a wheel.\n\nThe round reading room was really the brainchild of an extraordinary former director of the British Museum, Antonio Peni. This quote I think is incredible, which I will read out for the benefit of people listening. He said, I want a poor student to have the same means of indulging his learned curiosity of following his rational pursuits of consulting, the same authorities of fathoming, the most intricate inquiry as the richest man in the kingdom, and I think that's still relevant to what we do.\n\nCullen in walks us over to an old ledger where Jacob Richter and others signed in\n\nOscar Wilde, Virginia Wolfe. You see here, Sylvia Hurst, Karl Marx, who pretty much spent every day for 30 years sat here writing D capital. When Gorbachev became leader of the Soviet Union and visited Britain for the first time in 1984, he came and looked at the round reading room and the desks where both Lenin and Marx had sat and said, if people don't like communism, they can blame the British Museum. And I can't think of many museums that are held responsible or accountable for an entire sociopolitical order.\n\nSo Nick, the headlines of the past few years for the British Museum have been, according to my reading, at least overwhelmingly bad. And so I wanted to ask you, as you were offered this job, first of all, I'm curious whether you were at all conflicted. I mean, it's an amazing job, so I'm assuming you were eager to take it, but the outstanding issues are substantial. There's the controversies over repatriation, as we've discussed. There's some strong protest and activism, particularly over reliance on corporate sponsorship of petroleum firms and so on. You had Peter Higgs a curator in your Greek and Roman department who was allegedly stealing objects from within the museum and selling them on eBay.\n\nAnd I've read, although I'd love you to tell me if this is wrong, that the British Museum was alerted to this and did not pursue it. And then additionally, when we were reporting out our piece on repatriation a few years ago, we couldn't even get the communications department to field our questions much less and official, and we had our recording equipment seized when we showed up to try to record this time, the director of the museum. That's, you met us quite warmly. We had a off the record chat with coffee. Lovely. We had a walkthrough of the museum. Lovely. And now you're sitting down for the studio interview. So can you just talk about the degree to which either your appointment as director or a general shift why that's happened?\n\nTo go back to the beginning, no, I didn't think twice. The museum obviously has to think very much about new cycles, but is also in the business of perpetuity and forever, rather than just getting through each day's new cycle. You take it very seriously and you take it with a little bit of a pinch of salt as well. Not saying, oh, I don't care, but okay, this is today. But then there's many, many more days to come and the question is each day, can you make improvement and keep moving it forward?\n\nIn other words, it comes with the territory to some degree. To\n\nSome degree, yeah. I'm not saying, oh, therefore does it matter? Or\n\nYeah, drunk museum goers smashing the Portland VAEs. Exactly.\n\nThere will always be a crisis.",

      "transcript_chunk": "So you got your PhD in economics from Harvard. I know that you and your husband have eight children and you are stepmom to six more children from your husband's first marriage. I'm guessing there are not many other Harvard educated economists who have 14 children.\n\nI don't know of any absence of evidence isn't evidence of absence, but I don't know of any.\n\nKatherine Lic is an economics professor at the Catholic University of America. I asked about her main areas of research,\n\nEducation, schools, fertility, family formation,\n\nAnd what would you say you bring to those topics that the median economists might not bring?\n\nI think I bring to the table a large number of things that are outside of the field and you know, of course I'd be disingenuous if I didn't add that will have a lot of kids and so that makes you think about things a little bit differently.\n\nYou might say that a lot of people have started to think differently about fertility and family formation For decades, the great fear among demographers and politicians and environmentalists was overpopulation. They argued that the earth's resources simply couldn't support 3 billion people, certainly not 5 billion or 8 billion, which is where we stand today. That fear hasn't totally gone away, but it has been joined by a fear of the opposite that there are now too few babies being born. Here's an astonishing fact. The global fertility rate has fallen by more than half over the past 50 years.\n\nWhy? The answer to that question is complicated and any solution is even more so today on Freakonomics Radio, we began a three part series about the great arc of human life. The inspiration for this series was a famous painting by Gustav Klimt called Death and Life. It shows a healthy newborn lying serenely on a bed of flowers among a group of adults, most of them young women. But there off to the side is death. A grim reaper smiling over this peaceful scene knowing that he will win out in the end, that's the thing.\n\nLife is finite and life is precious. Does our knowing that it's finite make it even more precious? That's a deep question. One we probably won't be able to answer during this series, but it will surely be hovering over every minute. Our three part series, Cradle to Grave, starts now.\n\nThis is Freakonomics Radio, the podcast that explores the hidden side of everything with your host Steven Dubner.\n\nDonald Trump has declared himself the fertilization president and he wants Americans to have more babies. Why? Let's start with what's called the total fertility rate. That's the expected number of births that a woman would have over her lifetime. In the first half of the 19th century, the US fertility rate was over six babies per woman. In the late 1950s, it was 3.7. Today it's at 1.6 babies per woman, a record low. That also puts us well below the so-called replacement rate of 2.1. That's the number needed to keep a population steady. So the Trump administration has proposed a variety of policies, a $5,000 baby bonus, federally funded fertility education programs, even a national medal of motherhood for women who have six or more children.\n\nKatherine LIC would certainly be eligible for that medal. She had six of her eight biological children while she was in graduate school. The oldest is now 25. She has found that people make assumptions about women with a lot of children.\n\nThe first assumption, which is pretty common, is that it's somehow a less than rational choice that you do this maybe for cult-like reasons, because somebody says that you should, or a religious leader says that you should, especially as somebody who's professional life is devoted to introspection and clear thinking and understanding, especially as an economist, the nature of rationality that feels really painful. You fear that it may look to your colleagues as if the choice to have children is in some way revealing a lack of seriousness about your work. I wanna be very clear. Most of what I'm telling you is in my head, I'm not accusing anybody of having been less than supportive or negative in any way.\n\nBut the concern is you think that your colleagues will think you're not as capable.\n\nWe should say there are plenty of male economists who do manage to have a good number of children while they're building their careers.\n\nYeah. If you're raising the question of the difference between men and women having children in academia, we know that getting married and having children there isn't the productivity penalty and in fact, maybe a little gain. But for women, of course, time is a rival. Good, right? When people say children are expensive, they're not wrong, but they aren't used to using the language economies. They're expensive in terms of opportunity cost or lifestyle cost. If the only fun thing you could do 40 years ago on your weekends with the amount of income you had relative to the purchasing power that you have, is the only fun thing you could do is stay home and watch TV and drink beer. Well, maybe having a kid is not really a big problem for you, but if the thing you can do now is you could travel, for instance, way more accessible for so many more people all around the world, well that next kid is gonna completely change.\n\nThat's a real cost.\n\n40 years ago, fewer than 3% of US citizens even owned a passport. Today it's around 50%. So yes, a lot of things have changed. A lot of opportunities have arisen. As she was thinking about big picture fertility, Alek realized it would be useful to consider not just those smaller families, but also outliers like herself, people who are still having a lot of kids,\n\nDo they believe different things? Have they made different choices? Do they have a different value structure? What does that look like? So I began traveling around the country to speak with women in a variety of communities who have larger than normal sized families to find out why they're doing this and what they think it means for themselves and for their families.\n\nLIC and her research team interviewed 55 women across the country, all of whom have five or more children. The research project became a book that LIC published in 2024 called Hannah's Children. The Women Quietly Defying the Birth Dearth,\n\nThe Biblical Hannah is probably the single most known character in the world who represents someone who really wanted a child.\n\nYour book is a qualitative study, but it's not a quantitative study. Plainly. If we're talking about big population statistical analysis, this is just a drop in the bucket. Why did you go that route?\n\nWe really do have a lot of of great large population data about what's happening with birth rates in general. What we're missing are some of the nitty gritty about the theory. So that's where you turn in social sciences to qualitative work when you're trying to struggle with the theory.\n\nAll the women she interviewed have college degrees and all are religious.\n\nThey don't see wanting children as a choice of a plan or control in the way that I think most people think about planning their families. There's a very specific content to wanting children, which has to do with cooperation with God's providence. I think people who think you can't have too many children are particularly interesting. Children are this sort of substantive good, but they probably don't obey the same laws of economic preferences where most normal goods, you eventually get satisfied by them or we say diminishing returns.\n\nOne thing this makes me think of is really I think an often unobserved or maybe even unobservable idea, which is what is the utility to the children who were born in a big family who wouldn't have been born if it was a smaller or average size family? And in this regard, I point to myself, I'm the youngest of eight. I believe you were one of nine siblings, is that right?\n\nYes. I'm the oldest of nine, so I would've made it. I would've made it.\n\nYou would've made it. But I keep thinking like,\n\nBut you would not have made it.\n\nYeah, if my family hadn't decided for some rather strange set of reasons to have eight children, I wouldn't be around to complain about, you know, anything much less a pine on proper family size.\n\nWhen I was having my children, it gave me some special pleasure to think about, you know, having my fifth, I would think, okay, which of my siblings is my fifth? And that's my brother Ed. He's such a good friend of mine and Ed's. Great. So then when you think like, are we done trying to have children and you think to yourself, well maybe there would be a little bit of a loss in thinking there isn't gonna be that last child.\n\nOne memory I have of the Biblical Hannah is that, you know, this is back when prayer was not common or normalized in the Jewish tradition, but that Hannah did pray very, very intensely to God to be able to have a child which she hadn't been able to, and that her prayer was so intense that people thought she was crazy. Yes, and that strikes me as a perhaps unintentionally appropriate parallel between the Biblical Hannah and modern Hannahs who are considered like, I mean, I didn't plan to ask you this question this directly 'cause it sounds quite rude, but have people from your friend groups, professional groups, your own extended family, et cetera, thought that you were a little bit crazy for wanting so badly to have so many children?\n\nYeah, people just don't know what to make of it. The most polite version is something like, why? You know, why would you do this? Sometimes there's less polite versions of it.\n\nFor instance,\n\nDon't you know how this happens?\n\nOh my gosh,\n\nRight. People say these things when they see a group of little kids and they think, oh no, they're not all yours. Most of us who get asked these questions, you come up with something kind of funny, but in fact there's not an easy way to answer. Why would you do this?\n\nBut you feel this is your servitude essentially. Yes. Would you say to a stranger, I believe that God wants me to have a lot of children?\n\nI might say it, it would depend on the context of the conversation I might revert to. I think it's great. It's a substantive good. Having children is wonderful. I sometimes say I enjoyed my first one so much, I wanted another one and kept going.\n\nIs it fair to call you an advocate of or a promoter of higher fertility? In general?\n\nI'm only an advocate insofar as I'm happy to talk about my own personal experience, but I'm a really strong believer that the household is the correct locus of decision making and that only an individual household can correctly assess the costs and benefits to them. I also think it's the only locus that is workable in a non tyrannical society or free society will say\n\nWhen Katherine lik says that only an individual household can assess the costs and benefits of having children. I'm guessing most of us can appreciate that sentiment, but I'm guessing we also appreciate that a steep drop infertility across the society does have consequences. Mathias DKA certainly does.\n\nHow many the children we have and what we do with our families are in many ways the most important decisions in our life, both at a personal level, but also for the economy.\n\nDKA is a German born economist who teaches at the London School of Economics.\n\nI'm trained originally as a macro economist, but in fact most of my work touches on family economics.\n\nHe also co-wrote a book called Love, money and Parenting, how Economics explains the Way We Raise our Kids, and he has three children. If you're wondering, economists like DKA and LIC didn't use to do research on things like family formation, but that changed with Gary Becker. He was a more holistic thinker than most economists of his era. Becker got his PhD in 1955, won a Nobel Prize in 1992 and died in 2014, and he liked to blend in ideas from sociology and criminology. When Mathias DKA got his PhD at the University of Chicago, he studied under Gary Becker\n\nFor Gary Becker. Economics is just a way to think about how people make decisions and you can apply that method to everything. Who you marry, how many children you have, how you educate your children. All of those are decisions that can be analyzed with the tools of economics.\n\nWhy as an economist, is fertility and family formation such an important topic?\n\nIf you think for example of economic growth, it depends on population growth, how many people there are. Of course it's relevant for economic prospects. If an economy is shrinking in population, it'll also shrink in economic output. There's also important decisions on education on human capital more widely that are done inside families, which matter a lot for how the economy does in the long term.\n\nEconomists have many phrases to describe many things that normal people don't need. You have a lot of jargon when I hear you talk about children. My mind goes to some of the categorizations that economists use to describe things like normal goods, inferior goods and luxury goods. Where do children fall in there?\n\nThat was the first fundamental question in the economics of fertility because the first observation in the data that Gary Becker had to deal with when he started with this whole enterprise was that it used to be the case that richer people have fewer children. So there was large families among the poorer households, smaller families among the richer households, and that was true everywhere across countries. Also, over time, as countries get richer, they have fewer children. If you just think of children as consumption goods, which maybe you shouldn't, but if you wanted to do that, you would have to say that sounds like children are an inferior good. It's an example of the kind of goods that you want less of as you get richer with children. It's not quite like that when you get richer, instead of having a child, you have a very fancy dog or something like that.\n\nIt's not the mechanism that's going on, so something else has to be going on. Gary Becker tried to explain this pattern even though rich people otherwise have more of everything, and his idea was that having children involves both deciding how many to have and how much to invest in them, something that he refers to as child quality.\n\nOkay. If you were starting to worry that Gary Becker wasn't quite a real economist, you can stop worrying now that we're talking about child quality and how much to invest in children, and there's plenty of evidence that Becker's framework was correct. High income countries like Japan and South Korea and Spain have fertility rates well below the replacement level. What has changed since Becker's time is that many countries that are not wealthy, like Albania and Nepal and El Salvador are also below the replacement level.\n\nWhat was initially something done only by higher income parents is not done by almost everybody. And so while the quality, quality choice is still there, it's perhaps not what's driving most of the variation that we are seeing today.\n\nOkay, so what has been driving lower fertility rates? One obvious answer, obvious at least to an economist is the fact that millions upon millions of women have been entering the workforce.\n\nWe had a model of a clear gender separation of a labor a generation ago where many women were homemakers or would interrupt their careers for long periods. We are in a different phase now where a young woman and men have very similar aspirations. Most mothers are working, fathers are working, and that creates a tension that we haven't fully resolved yet. It's difficult to have two jobs and three or four children. So many people stop a bit earlier. The other thing that has happened is how we raise our children has changed. The nature of parenting is now quite different. We see in all the high income countries that parents spent a lot more time on parenting than they did a generation ago.",

      "transcript_chunk": "Hey there, it's S Steven Dubner and you are about to hear the fourth and final episode of our series, How to Succeed at Failing, which was first published in 2023. If you missed any of the earlier episodes, they should be right there in your podcast app. For this version, we have updated facts and figures as necessary. As always, thanks for listening. If I asked you to name the world's Deadliest Infectious Disease, what would you say? COVID-19. That was the biggest infectious killer for a few years, but not anymore. How about malaria?\n\nInfluenza, HIV. Those are all deadly, but not the deadliest. So what's number one?\n\nActually, TB for the last 2030 years has been the number one infectious disease killer in the world.\n\nBaek Javid is a physician scientist who studies tuberculosis or tb. You may think of TB as a 19th century disease. When it was called consumption, it killed John Keats Anton Chekhov, and at least two of the Bronte sisters. It killed the heroines of both La Boem and LA Ravita, and today it still kills more than a million people each year, most of them in the developing world.\n\nTB is a disease of poverty. It's really a major problem in India, China, Indonesia, Pakistan, South Africa, Nigeria,\n\nTB is a bacterial infection. There is a vaccine for it, but it's not always effective. It can be treated with antibiotics, but it's a long and fairly complicated course of treatment. And as deadly as TB is, it doesn't draw the attention or the funding that flow to other diseases.\n\nThere is no Hollywood star that gets tb, that puts it in the public mind and everyday people's thoughts. One of the reasons I was attracted to this field is I felt that infectious diseases in general, and TB in particular, is, you know, one of the mechanisms of injustice in our world, and I really wanted to tackle that.\n\nJavid runs a tuberculosis research lab at the University of California, San Francisco. He has also worked at labs in Beijing and at Harvard. His kind of research comes with a lot of failure.\n\nI remember in my graduate school, I went over a year and a half without a single experiment working, and it's very hard to get up in the morning and go back and expect to fail again.\n\nThe first drug that was found to successfully fight TB is called streptomycin. It was discovered in 1943, it won a Nobel Prize for sel. Waxman, the main scientist behind it.\n\nAnd the way that streptomycin works is that it does two things. It inhibits the process of making new proteins. It's called a protein synthesis inhibitor, but that in itself doesn't kill the bug. What kills the bug is that in addition to that inhibitory action, it actually causes the bug to make mistakes when it makes these proteins.\n\nWhat interested job, it was this second function, the drug causing the bacteria to make mistakes as they are creating the proteins that produce the symptoms of tb. So he went looking for other ways to trigger those mistakes, and he found some, but it turned out this wasn't enough to thwart the bacteria.\n\nWhat was really shocking and surprising to me is the bug didn't seem to mind. It just carried on regardless. So I cranked up the error rate and I kept pushing and pushing, and really the bugs were kind of fine with it until eventually when I had really cranked up the error rate an awful lot. Then the bugs died. It takes a lot of error to kill these bugs. I was reflecting on my results and I was thinking, this just doesn't make any sense to me. The prevailing dogma at the time is that with a small amount of error, you induce what's called error catastrophe, where the errors in the new proteins make faulty machinery in the cell that then makes more errors and it just feeds on itself.\n\nAnd these bugs were extremely resilient. And that made me take a step back and I thought, what if actually these errors aren't detrimental after all, at least in a moderate amount? And that was my, I guess, aha moment. I have to be honest. At the beginning, I had no idea why this was. We were coming up with lots of different ideas as to explain it, but after a lot of experimentation and blind alleys and wrong turns, we figured out that what's happening is that this mistranslation is allowing the bacteria to innovate. And that was a really exciting moment. And I kind of coined the term adaptive mistranslation, that sometimes these errors in the right context and in the right degree can actually be good for the bug\n\nAdaptive mistranslation. Think about that for a minute, and let's think about it outside the realm of tuberculosis research, it's the idea that errors in the right context and degree can strengthen an organism, can make it more resilient and lead it to innovate. Now, that sounds like a magic trick, doesn't it? But if it can work for tb, can it work for us? Today on Freakonomics Radio, the final episode of our series, How to Succeed At Failing, we will hear about another counterintuitive way to fight off failure.\n\nThe pre-mortem is designed to help you do better rather than to shut off innovation.\n\nWe ask if failure should be taught formally in the classroom.\n\nThe whole point of the whole semester is gonna be, Hey, everybody fails and we fail at everything.\n\nAnd whether failure needs a museum,\n\nWe have a Ford Edsel, we have Pepsi, crystal New Coke,\n\nHow to Succeed at Failing. The final chapter, starting right now.\n\nThis is Freakonomics Radio, the podcast that explores the hidden side of everything with your host, Steven Dubner.\n\nGary Klein is a cognitive psychologist who advises organizations on how to respond to failure. His latest research is around what are called wicked problems.\n\nA wicked problem is one where there's not a clear right answer that people would generally agree upon.\n\nAnd what share of problems in the world are wicked problems?\n\nMost of the major social problems we wrestle with are wicked problems. We have multiple stakeholders, and there's no way to please all of them. And so there's all of this potential conflict and resource. Situations change or pandemics arise wars arise, things that are unexpected, that are gonna upset what you're doing.\n\nIn any of those conflicts that Klein is describing, any of those disruptions, let's call them, we suddenly crash into a complex situation that's also fogged in by uncertainty. And now we have to essentially guess what's gonna happen next. And those guesses often turn out to be wrong.\n\nI actually went on Anderson Cooper during the early days of the pandemic to tell everyone how wrong I was.\n\nThat is Theresa McPhail. She is a medical anthropologist at the Stevens Institute of Technology, one of the country's top engineering colleges. And yes, McPhail is an appropriate name for a professor discussing her own failure in a series about failure. But just wait. It will get even more appropriate later in this episode. Anyway, McPhail had studied the outbreak of the H one N one Influenza pandemic in 2009. So her expertise was in demand when Covid came along.\n\nI really thought when we heard the first rumblings out of China in 2019 and early 2020, I was like, we have this, like there's mechanisms in place, but what I hadn't really considered was what over a decade of cutting funding had done, and it had basically decimated a lot of public health. I thought we were more prepared. And it turns out we were not. And I felt badly because I had done an interview with Vice News in February and I said, calm down. You know, we are not China. We are better equipped. Here's why I had to go to the ER in March, because I got very sick on March 1st.\n\nI went to the ER and I remember the ER doctor saying to me that he had never seen a situation where they were so ill-equipped with PPE or personal protective equipment. That's when I realized uhoh I was wrong.\n\nNow, what might have happened if Theresa McFail, and not just McFail, but let's say everyone in the realm of pandemic preparedness, what if they had all thought a bit differently about this wicked problem? What if before the failure happened, they pretended that there had already been a failure? You are probably familiar with the idea of a post-mortem or what the military calls an after action review. By that point, of course, the damage has been done. So what if you flip the order and conduct a pre-mortem? That's what Gary Klein called this strategy when he invented it in the 1980s.\n\nThe pre-mortem is designed to help people surface realistic possibilities and threats so that you can improve the plan, improve the product, and increase your chance of success.\n\nAt the time, Klein was running an r and d firm that studied decision making in organizations.\n\nYou know, many of our projects succeeded, but not all of them. And we would occasionally have an after action review. Those weren't exciting things to do because we were pretty disgruntled At one point, I said, why don't we do this at the very beginning? Why don't we imagine that it fails? Often in organizations, if you have like a kickoff meeting, there'll be a part where they say, alright, now does anybody have any concerns? Are there any critiques? Does anybody see any problems? And nobody says anything either because they don't want to disrupt the harmony of the team or because they're not thinking that anything could go wrong. 'cause they're excited to get started.\n\nSo to break through that mindset, I developed this technique of a pre-mortem. And at the end of a kickoff meeting, we say, alright, imagine that I'm looking at a crystal ball. I'm dialing forward six months, maybe a year, whatever the right timeframe is. And oh no, this project has failed. It's failed in a big way. We know that there is no doubt this crystal ball is infallible. Now everybody in the room, you've got two minutes, write down all the reasons why this project failed. And it's amazing the types of issues that people surface that ordinarily they wouldn't say in public or even think about.\n\nCan you explain from a psychological perspective why that works?\n\nWell, after I developed the technique, I read about some research on perspective hindsight. And so I think a big part of it is the certainty that it's failed. And so now that changes my mindset. So I'm not resisting if I say, here's the plan, are there any problems? There's all kinds of pressure not to think about problems, but by being certain that the plan has failed by entering into that exercise, it just changes the whole valence, the whole experience.\n\nSo interesting. I mean, we always hear about how humans perform poorly under uncertainty generally. So you're saying you're just removing the uncertainty of whether it will work. You're saying it didn't. Now tell me why it didn't. And that provides clarity, right? So what happens next after people voice these ideas? What happens now?\n\nOkay, so let me get, we never thought about this as a tool outside our company. This was just something we did. But then we had a big project we were doing for the Air Force. It was a software tool for identifying ways of using precision guided munitions. And I told my prime sponsor, I wanna do a pre-mortem. And he said, what's that? And I explained it to him and he said, absolutely no way. We want everybody to be positive. This is such a depressing exercise, I don't wanna do it. And I said, this is an important project. We want it to succeed. This is a way to make it succeed. And reluctantly he agreed to do it. We were doing this pre-mortem and there was this young captain hadn't said a word.\n\nThe meeting had gone on for about two days, hadn't said a word. And it was time for him to come up with his, what he had on his list. We go around one at a time around the room and we do one or two or three sweeps. And he looked a little nervous and he said, this tool that we're building, it's for people in the field and they have these low powered laptops. The two we're building runs on a supercomputer that takes 48 hours. I don't see how that's gonna work. And there was silence in the room because everybody realized he was right. And then somebody said, now I've got a back of the envelope technique that I use that could be a shortcut.\n\nAnd all of a sudden we were back in business. But if we hadn't done that, we would've failed. And he never would've said that if we didn't give him that space.\n\nAnd you're saying the person who spoke up was the most junior or among the most junior in the room?\n\nYes, he was.\n\nSo I've seen this myself many times, not in a pre-mortem, but just in a meeting generally where junior people, they have very little incentive to speak up. It seems like there's more downside than upside. It strikes me that American meeting culture is dominated by noisy people who have a lot of confidence, which is often unearned. And I'm curious if you have any advice for having better ideas come through in meetings?\n\nI have a couple of ideas, but one of them is the pre-mortem. Because the pre-mortem creates a culture of candor. People learn that they can voice unpopular ideas and not be punished for it. It also creates an environment where I'm surprised at the ideas that you come up with or this young captain comes up with, because a pre-mortem really harvests the different experience and ability of the people in the room. I don't know what's in your head, so how can I appreciate your perspective? But in a pre-mortem, I realize, wow, I never thought of it that way. So there's a chance for the people in the room to start to gain more respect for their colleagues.\n\nI would think that anonymity would be a useful tool here. Why do you not use that?\n\nAnonymity could be useful in environments that are usually very punitive, but in terms of creating a culture of candor, it works better if we're all face to face.\n\nDoes it sometimes get personal even ugly?\n\nI have never seen that happen surprisingly enough. No. No, because everybody knows that this is a made up failure. So it's not life or death, although it could be. And everybody knows that the intent is to improve the plan.\n\nCan you talk about how to encourage candid feedback generally? Again, it may be the more junior employees, but whoever it is that might have a valuable insight, how can you best float that insight up to leadership?\n\nI've wrestled with that issue for a while because most organizations say that they want insights, but they don't because insights are gonna mean that we have to change. And if I'm a mid-level manager and now I've got to change my supply lines, I've gotta change my staffing, can we just continue what we are doing and try to do it better? They'll say, we wanna be harmonious, so we're going to make decisions where everybody agrees. A harmonious decision is a terrible idea because that means that everybody has a veto. And so your chance of coming up with an innovation has been severely compromised.\n\nDo you ever have harmonious decisions in your personal life, maybe with your family?\n\nI am guilty of the delusion that we can have harmonious decisions. And despite personal experience, I I hold onto this goal.\n\nDo you personally routinely do pre-mortems, even just a quick in your head one, when you're about to make a decision?\n\nI do not do it when I, I make lots of decisions and so I don't do it automatically.\n\nDid you pre-mortem this interview today, Gary? That was a no. After the break, we asked the CEO of a startup if he would like to try Gary Klein's pre-mortem idea.\n\nI guess I disagree with Gary.\n\nI'm Steven Dubner. This is Free Economics Radio. We'll be right back in 2018. Will Coleman left his job as a partner at McKinsey, the consulting firm in order to launch a rideshare startup called Alto.\n\nAt Alto, we're elevating rideshare for both drivers and passengers. We offer a really differentiated service through W2 employees and company owned vehicles. So at Alto, you always know exactly what you're gonna get a safe, clean, high quality ride every single time.\n\nA lot of those words sounded as if they were chosen to be contra, Uber and Lyft.

      "transcript_chunk": "And then they're 60% of the population, super majority in the North. You have the Kurds who are Sunnis, but their Kurds is separate ethnicity, then the Arabs.\n\nAnd then you have the Sunni Arabs who are another 20%. Well, Saddam Hussein was a secular Sunni Arab leading, essentially like, like on the Simpsons, the Kami Nazis, the both party who are like sort of both a little, just a fascist state essentially, right? With Arab characteristics or whatever. And, but, and, and not an entirely sectarian one. He had Christians and Kurds and Shiites in his government and things like that. It was not, you know, like just a caricature or whatever. It was a balance of power act. But after the Iranian revolution, Saddam had a real reason to fear that the Shiite revolution was gonna spread to Iraq. And that Iraqi Shiites, at least the armed and convinced ones would choose their religious sect and their alliance with Iran on that basis over their national and ethnic sect as Iraqis and Arabs, right?\n\nSeparate from the Persians. So, and he had real reason to believe that including that members of the Dawa party and people loyal to the Hakeem family were Abdul Aziz Al Hakeem and his people. They left to Go to Iran and they chose Iran's side in the war. So Saddam Hussein's solution to that was to conscript all these people and force them into his army and march them east against Iran and use them in that way. And this led to an absolutely brutal World War I maybe Russia, Ukraine style, trench warfare, tanks, artillery, and there's planes and and ships. And it was a hell of a war for nine years, all through the 1980s as the United States almost entirely backed Saddam Hussein, except for when they backed the Ayatollah.\n\nRemember Iran Contra and during Iran Contra, what do they do? They went to the Israelis and they said, Hey, you're still friends with the government in Iran. You guys don't mind the Ayatollah one bit and have maintained your friendship there. We wanna sell 'em some missiles and try to get the hostages out and then take the rest of the proceeds from the missiles and give them to the Contras in Nicaragua. And this is what became the great Iran Contra scandal. And so we\n\nShould also say, and and you highlight the importance of understanding Iran Contra. So this here, reading a major political scandal in the United States during the mid 1980s, senior officials and President Ronald Reagan's administration facilitated the secret sale of arms to Iran, which was under an arms embargo with the proceeds being used to find contra rebels fighting the estas government in Nicaragua despite Congress explicitly prohibiting such funding.\n\nYep. And this is of course, supposedly a side story, but a huge part of the side story is it absolutely was true as the great Gary Webb reported in the Dark Alliance series and in his great book Dark Alliance that and many other great journalists as well, that the CIA had a massive operation to bring cocaine into the United States by the truckload and planeload to sell it to poor Americans, blacks, especially in la. But also, yes, it's true. They even made a Tom Cruise movie after years of calling us Conspiracy Kooks and all this, the movie's about a guy named Barry Seale, whose job it was to fly guns and money down there and cocaine up here for the conscious for the CIA and into Bill Clinton's, Arkansas, where he was read in on this and the operation was run out of the Vice President's office, George HW Bush.\n\nAnd that much is true. And the same, they had the, I know less about, but they had, this is where all the cocaine from Miami Vice was coming into Florida in the same way. And this is where the crack epidemic came from in South LA and throughout the country really in, in many places. And they just don't give a damn about us, man. Congress said you can't have any money to fund the Congress. And they said, yeah, but we want to. Anyway, so this is how they did it. So the\n\nCIA, I a would help orchestrate this kind of transport of\n\nDrugs. Absolutely. Right. And then they completely destroyed the heroic Gary Webb for exposing this. And they didn't murder him, but they drove him to suicide. And you know, his, his good friend Robert Perry, the great journalist, verify that no, it really was a suicide. People thought it was suspicious 'cause he shot himself twice. But that does happen sometimes where people flinch on the first one. But it was his father's gun and he was totally depressed and he had signed his house over to his wife and somebody stole his motorcycle and he was like at the, at the, and, but they had run him out of his job at the San Jose Mercury News. They first ran him to the Hollywood beat and then he eventually he just quit and went to become an investigator for the California state legislator. So\n\nThe state doesn't have to kill you directly. They can psychologically\n\nDestroy you. That's right. Yeah. They put the gun in his mouth either way for doing the right thing. But anyway, and, and didn't get any facts wrong. The only thing that anyone had to attack him on was like the graphics editor put like a phrase outta context big on the page or something in the newspaper. You know what I mean? It was like something silly that made it sound like he was saying the purpose of the mission was to destroy the black community. When that, he never said that. What he said was they didn't give a damn about those people. I don't even know if he addressed that. Right? But he certainly wasn't saying that was what it was about. It was about funding the contras. But anyway, so they found their separate ways of doing it. And this is one of the things that made me like this is, I don't even have any idea where I first learned this, but I knew this while Reagan was still in office, or at least by the time Bush Senior was in office when I was still just like maybe a freshman in high school or younger than that, I knew that Ronald Reagan was a dope pusher.\n\nThe same guy with the just Say No. And the same guy with the massively increased penalties for people engaging in just simply the possession, much less the sale and trade and drugs. And so their people went to prison for decades, for life essentially, and literally for just possession of the same drugs that the government was bringing in. And so how are you ever gonna believe in a security force like that again, I never have. I don't know why you'd even need to see a Waco massacre or any other, or in a Iraq War or any other thing to detest these people. That's who they are. You know, I had this, it's the only part I really remember about it, but there's this great film producer named Kevin Booth. He was Bill Hicks' best friend and producer, and he did a documentary about the drug war where they show this guy and he goes, oh, they're all in prison and they're filming 'em through the gate and they're all yelling and whatever.\n\nYou can't really make out much. Right? They're all like yelling over each other. And one guy finally like, makes everybody be quiet. And he looks at the camera and he goes, listen, I'm doing 35 years 'cause I had a few rocks in my pocket. Does that sound right to you? I was like, dude, it was Ronald Reagan's cocaine in his pocket. Like that guarantees a full pardon man. Right? What are we talking about? That's not fair.\n\nIt's a dark aspect of human nature that the people that try to, if we talk about drugs, to ban drugs and really anyone who tries to ban a thing are often secretly participating in doing that thing.\n\nBootleggers and Baptist, you know,\n\nJust on a small tangent. Sure. Have you ever since you're a Texan, have you ever met Bill Hicks?\n\nNo, man. I learned about Bill Hicks like a month after he died. And so they started playing Insane Man on the Access Channel all the time. And I was like, oh my God, who's this guy? And then they're like, oh, he just died. But\n\nHe's a legend.\n\nI, he has been a huge influence on me. Yeah. You know? Yeah. In, in a lot of ways. So I'm very much a hixon.\n\nI apologize for that. It's good to do a shout out back to the drug war and that involvement from Carter and on and Reagan and Iran.\n\nWell, yeah, let's go back to Iran. 'cause the cocaine is really tied up in the contra end of the scandal point being America's back in Saddam. Except when they're helping Israel back Iran and by selling 'em these missiles. And they're even, I don't have my footnote anymore, but it's findable, I'm sure. Where they did talk about, you know, what we do is we support one side till they start getting ahead a little bit. Then we support the other side a little bit more and go, or we authorize the Israelis to increase support for Iran and play 'em back and forth against each other. So that's just not just, you know, offshore balancing and peace time. That's balancing in war time, encouraging them to keep killing each other, which is some pretty horrific policy to do.\n\nCould you also comment during this stage and this threat will continue, what role does Israel have to play in this, in this part of the story with Iran?\n\nWell, I don't know. Yeah, I don't know much about what they were saying about America's Iraq policy during that time, but I know that they were still friends with the Ayatollah and we're not gonna get to them Switching gears on the Ayatollah until Rabbe in 1993. So hold that thought. So the, the war still going on. We have to mention the chemical weapons too. Yes. America bought 'em, taxpayers bought 'em. There's a huge Iraq gate scandal it was called, where people were put on trial for the money. But then they, their defense was, but the government made me do it. What are you talking about? This was the whole thing to do. And they were, it was German chemical weapons, I believe, and maybe some French, but that were bought with supposed agricultural loans from the United States to Iraq.\n\nAnd they had a sophisticated biological weapons program too with anthrax and the rest. And the Americans sent them the precursors for the germs that he would need.\n\nDuring the Iran Iraq War in 1980 to 1988, Saddam Hussein's regime used chemical weapons extensively against Iranian forces and Kurdish civilians, most notably in the 1988 halal attack that killed an estimated 5,000 people and injured 20,000 more. There is substantial documentation that western governments, especially the US and some of its allies, provided Iraq with dual use technology intelligence and materials, which facilitated Iraq's chemical weapons program. Yep. And it goes\n\nOn, lemme drop two good footnotes for your people here. The first one would be Shane Harris, who's now at the Washington Post, you know, very official national security beat reporter. He wrote a piece about this@foreignpolicy.com a few years back where he goes into extensive detail. So as far as like authoritative sources, there you go. Okay. Nothing conspiratorial about this narrative at all, but then you want to do a deeper dive onto it, then Go to fff.org and it's, this is the Future Freedom Foundation. And there they have a page, and I'm sorry I always get the headline wrong, but it's something like, where did Saddam get his WMDs? Or where did Saddam get his chemical weapons? You know what you can do?\n\nYou can go cite colon fff.org and then that way you search just that site and then you can do chemical weapons Iraq, and I bet you'll find it. Yeah, right there. Where did Iraq get its weapons of mass destruction? And I had mentioned this, I, I guess on the Tucker show. And so I, I actually talked with Hornberger and I, I went back and I found, and I made sure that all of those LINKS are up to date and work for each of those stories. So people can go through and, and take a very close look at, those are just articles, nevermind all the books about it and stuff, which there are plenty.\n\nSo this is a set of LINKS assembled by Jacob Hornberger. The title is, where Did Rock Get Its Weapons of Mass Destruction on ff.org that people should check out.\n\nAnd then, oh, there's the, there's the Shane Harris and Matthew M-H-C-I-A Prove America helped Saddam as he gased Iran.\n\nThe US knew Hussein was launching some of the worst chemical attacks in history and still gave him a hand.\n\nAnd now by the official rules of confirmation bias, when Shane Harris admits something that I'm accusing, that means it's definitely true if I ever disagree with him while he's a liar from the Post. Got that.\n\nOkay, good to know. That's how truth works. Good.\n\nOf course,\n\nI'm so\n\nThere, there's your authoritative source, everybody, Shane Harris from The Post. Right? And that's a special inside joke for fans of where the Buffalo Romes too. Remember Harris from the Post? You ever seen that? It's the original fear in loathing in Las Vegas with Bill Murray?\n\nI didn't realize there was original fear in loathing in Las Vegas with Bill Murray. What really we're the\n\nBuffalo Romes the buffalo? I promise he will have a good time. And there's a joke in there about Harris from the Post. He's pretending to be Harris from The Post, and he's hanging out in the bathroom with Richard Nixon and I forgot the conversation. It's funny as hell\n\nThough. Similar type of wild journey of funeral and loathing. Oh\n\nYeah, yeah. I, I gotta admit I don't remember the story that well. It's very different than fear and loathing, but it's also\n\nVery good. Well, I know what I'm doing tonight. Okay, cool. Yeah. Now\n\nWe're the buffalo realm. It's, everyone will like it, I promise. Okay. Underrated Bill Murray.\n\nHe's forever underrated, actually. Genius actor. Okay. And so back to chemical weapons and Yes, and Hussein. Sad Hussein.\n\nYeah. So, okay. The war finally comes to an end in 1989, and at the same time the Soviets are withdrawing in Afghanistan. We're gonna get back to them in a minute. But the war comes to an end. And for the next couple of years, Saddam Hussein is in a struggle over war debts with his creditors. Kuwait, Saudi and UAE are demanding all their money back that they gave him for the war they loaned to him for the war. Now of course, he feels like he fought that war partially in their defense. And so, and also at this time, oil's trading at $12 a barrel. So he has no ability to repay them, rebuild his country or do any kind of thing.\n\nAnd they're completely putting the screws to him. And on top of that, this is disputed. Whether they were literally the Kuwaiti's, literally slant drilling under the border or whether it's really, that's kind of shorthand I think usually for, they were overproducing from shared oil wells that straddled the border. And when you have a contract that where your property and my property, but up next to each other and we got mineral rights, but we have a shared oil well down there, then we have a quota how much we pump. And you're not allowed to cheat and pump more out of our shared well than me in any given month or whatever as per the contract. That's kind of how that thing works. So in this case, it's the same thing over an international border. And the Kuwaiti's, at least they're also accused, and I know less about this, but they're accused also of using slant drilling techniques that they've been taught by Americans to drill that way and steal Iraqi oil, you know, from the margin.\n\nSo Hussein's pissed about this at the same time they're putting the screws to him over calling in the war debts. Now, I don't believe that this was the deliberate trap, but in effect it was. I think what happened was it was a matter of in, you know, the left hand didn't know what the right hand was doing. There was no real unified policy that had been sent down from on high how to handle this evidently. And so the CIA and CENTCOM were encouraging, which had been created as part of the Carter Doctrine, were encouraging Kuwait to be intransigent against Saddam and tell him to Go to hell. What the State Department, James A. Baker, through Ambassador Glassby and through Margaret Tut Weiler and John Kelly were sending signals that actually, go ahead.",

      "transcript_chunk": "Hey there, it's S Steven Dubner and you are about to hear the fourth and final episode of our series, How to Succeed at Failing, which was first published in 2023. If you missed any of the earlier episodes, they should be right there in your podcast app. For this version, we have updated facts and figures as necessary. As always, thanks for listening. If I asked you to name the world's Deadliest Infectious Disease, what would you say? COVID-19. That was the biggest infectious killer for a few years, but not anymore. How about malaria?\n\nInfluenza, HIV. Those are all deadly, but not the deadliest. So what's number one?\n\nActually, TB for the last 2030 years has been the number one infectious disease killer in the world.\n\nBaek Javid is a physician scientist who studies tuberculosis or tb. You may think of TB as a 19th century disease. When it was called consumption, it killed John Keats Anton Chekhov, and at least two of the Bronte sisters. It killed the heroines of both La Boem and LA Ravita, and today it still kills more than a million people each year, most of them in the developing world.\n\nTB is a disease of poverty. It's really a major problem in India, China, Indonesia, Pakistan, South Africa, Nigeria,\n\nTB is a bacterial infection. There is a vaccine for it, but it's not always effective. It can be treated with antibiotics, but it's a long and fairly complicated course of treatment. And as deadly as TB is, it doesn't draw the attention or the funding that flow to other diseases.\n\nThere is no Hollywood star that gets tb, that puts it in the public mind and everyday people's thoughts. One of the reasons I was attracted to this field is I felt that infectious diseases in general, and TB in particular, is, you know, one of the mechanisms of injustice in our world, and I really wanted to tackle that.\n\nJavid runs a tuberculosis research lab at the University of California, San Francisco. He has also worked at labs in Beijing and at Harvard. His kind of research comes with a lot of failure.\n\nI remember in my graduate school, I went over a year and a half without a single experiment working, and it's very hard to get up in the morning and go back and expect to fail again.\n\nThe first drug that was found to successfully fight TB is called streptomycin. It was discovered in 1943, it won a Nobel Prize for sel. Waxman, the main scientist behind it.\n\nAnd the way that streptomycin works is that it does two things. It inhibits the process of making new proteins. It's called a protein synthesis inhibitor, but that in itself doesn't kill the bug. What kills the bug is that in addition to that inhibitory action, it actually causes the bug to make mistakes when it makes these proteins.\n\nWhat interested job, it was this second function, the drug causing the bacteria to make mistakes as they are creating the proteins that produce the symptoms of tb. So he went looking for other ways to trigger those mistakes, and he found some, but it turned out this wasn't enough to thwart the bacteria.\n\nWhat was really shocking and surprising to me is the bug didn't seem to mind. It just carried on regardless. So I cranked up the error rate and I kept pushing and pushing, and really the bugs were kind of fine with it until eventually when I had really cranked up the error rate an awful lot. Then the bugs died. It takes a lot of error to kill these bugs. I was reflecting on my results and I was thinking, this just doesn't make any sense to me. The prevailing dogma at the time is that with a small amount of error, you induce what's called error catastrophe, where the errors in the new proteins make faulty machinery in the cell that then makes more errors and it just feeds on itself.\n\nAnd these bugs were extremely resilient. And that made me take a step back and I thought, what if actually these errors aren't detrimental after all, at least in a moderate amount? And that was my, I guess, aha moment. I have to be honest. At the beginning, I had no idea why this was. We were coming up with lots of different ideas as to explain it, but after a lot of experimentation and blind alleys and wrong turns, we figured out that what's happening is that this mistranslation is allowing the bacteria to innovate. And that was a really exciting moment. And I kind of coined the term adaptive mistranslation, that sometimes these errors in the right context and in the right degree can actually be good for the bug\n\nAdaptive mistranslation. Think about that for a minute, and let's think about it outside the realm of tuberculosis research, it's the idea that errors in the right context and degree can strengthen an organism, can make it more resilient and lead it to innovate. Now, that sounds like a magic trick, doesn't it? But if it can work for tb, can it work for us? Today on Freakonomics Radio, the final episode of our series, How to Succeed At Failing, we will hear about another counterintuitive way to fight off failure.\n\nThe pre-mortem is designed to help you do better rather than to shut off innovation.\n\nWe ask if failure should be taught formally in the classroom.\n\nThe whole point of the whole semester is gonna be, Hey, everybody fails and we fail at everything.\n\nAnd whether failure needs a museum,\n\nWe have a Ford Edsel, we have Pepsi, crystal New Coke,\n\nHow to Succeed at Failing. The final chapter, starting right now.\n\nThis is Freakonomics Radio, the podcast that explores the hidden side of everything with your host, Steven Dubner.\n\nGary Klein is a cognitive psychologist who advises organizations on how to respond to failure. His latest research is around what are called wicked problems.\n\nA wicked problem is one where there's not a clear right answer that people would generally agree upon.\n\nAnd what share of problems in the world are wicked problems?\n\nMost of the major social problems we wrestle with are wicked problems. We have multiple stakeholders, and there's no way to please all of them. And so there's all of this potential conflict and resource. Situations change or pandemics arise wars arise, things that are unexpected, that are gonna upset what you're doing.\n\nIn any of those conflicts that Klein is describing, any of those disruptions, let's call them, we suddenly crash into a complex situation that's also fogged in by uncertainty. And now we have to essentially guess what's gonna happen next. And those guesses often turn out to be wrong.\n\nI actually went on Anderson Cooper during the early days of the pandemic to tell everyone how wrong I was.\n\nThat is Theresa McPhail. She is a medical anthropologist at the Stevens Institute of Technology, one of the country's top engineering colleges. And yes, McPhail is an appropriate name for a professor discussing her own failure in a series about failure. But just wait. It will get even more appropriate later in this episode. Anyway, McPhail had studied the outbreak of the H one N one Influenza pandemic in 2009. So her expertise was in demand when Covid came along.\n\nI really thought when we heard the first rumblings out of China in 2019 and early 2020, I was like, we have this, like there's mechanisms in place, but what I hadn't really considered was what over a decade of cutting funding had done, and it had basically decimated a lot of public health. I thought we were more prepared. And it turns out we were not. And I felt badly because I had done an interview with Vice News in February and I said, calm down. You know, we are not China. We are better equipped. Here's why I had to go to the ER in March, because I got very sick on March 1st.\n\nI went to the ER and I remember the ER doctor saying to me that he had never seen a situation where they were so ill-equipped with PPE or personal protective equipment. That's when I realized uhoh I was wrong.\n\nNow, what might have happened if Theresa McFail, and not just McFail, but let's say everyone in the realm of pandemic preparedness, what if they had all thought a bit differently about this wicked problem? What if before the failure happened, they pretended that there had already been a failure? You are probably familiar with the idea of a post-mortem or what the military calls an after action review. By that point, of course, the damage has been done. So what if you flip the order and conduct a pre-mortem? That's what Gary Klein called this strategy when he invented it in the 1980s.\n\nThe pre-mortem is designed to help people surface realistic possibilities and threats so that you can improve the plan, improve the product, and increase your chance of success.\n\nAt the time, Klein was running an r and d firm that studied decision making in organizations.\n\nYou know, many of our projects succeeded, but not all of them. And we would occasionally have an after action review. Those weren't exciting things to do because we were pretty disgruntled At one point, I said, why don't we do this at the very beginning? Why don't we imagine that it fails? Often in organizations, if you have like a kickoff meeting, there'll be a part where they say, alright, now does anybody have any concerns? Are there any critiques? Does anybody see any problems? And nobody says anything either because they don't want to disrupt the harmony of the team or because they're not thinking that anything could go wrong. 'cause they're excited to get started.\n\nSo to break through that mindset, I developed this technique of a pre-mortem. And at the end of a kickoff meeting, we say, alright, imagine that I'm looking at a crystal ball. I'm dialing forward six months, maybe a year, whatever the right timeframe is. And oh no, this project has failed. It's failed in a big way. We know that there is no doubt this crystal ball is infallible. Now everybody in the room, you've got two minutes, write down all the reasons why this project failed. And it's amazing the types of issues that people surface that ordinarily they wouldn't say in public or even think about.\n\nCan you explain from a psychological perspective why that works?\n\nWell, after I developed the technique, I read about some research on perspective hindsight. And so I think a big part of it is the certainty that it's failed. And so now that changes my mindset. So I'm not resisting if I say, here's the plan, are there any problems? There's all kinds of pressure not to think about problems, but by being certain that the plan has failed by entering into that exercise, it just changes the whole valence, the whole experience.\n\nSo interesting. I mean, we always hear about how humans perform poorly under uncertainty generally. So you're saying you're just removing the uncertainty of whether it will work. You're saying it didn't. Now tell me why it didn't. And that provides clarity, right? So what happens next after people voice these ideas? What happens now?\n\nOkay, so let me get, we never thought about this as a tool outside our company. This was just something we did. But then we had a big project we were doing for the Air Force. It was a software tool for identifying ways of using precision guided munitions. And I told my prime sponsor, I wanna do a pre-mortem. And he said, what's that? And I explained it to him and he said, absolutely no way. We want everybody to be positive. This is such a depressing exercise, I don't wanna do it. And I said, this is an important project. We want it to succeed. This is a way to make it succeed. And reluctantly he agreed to do it. We were doing this pre-mortem and there was this young captain hadn't said a word.\n\nThe meeting had gone on for about two days, hadn't said a word. And it was time for him to come up with his, what he had on his list. We go around one at a time around the room and we do one or two or three sweeps. And he looked a little nervous and he said, this tool that we're building, it's for people in the field and they have these low powered laptops. The two we're building runs on a supercomputer that takes 48 hours. I don't see how that's gonna work. And there was silence in the room because everybody realized he was right. And then somebody said, now I've got a back of the envelope technique that I use that could be a shortcut.\n\nAnd all of a sudden we were back in business. But if we hadn't done that, we would've failed. And he never would've said that if we didn't give him that space.\n\nAnd you're saying the person who spoke up was the most junior or among the most junior in the room?\n\nYes, he was.\n\nSo I've seen this myself many times, not in a pre-mortem, but just in a meeting generally where junior people, they have very little incentive to speak up. It seems like there's more downside than upside. It strikes me that American meeting culture is dominated by noisy people who have a lot of confidence, which is often unearned. And I'm curious if you have any advice for having better ideas come through in meetings?\n\nI have a couple of ideas, but one of them is the pre-mortem. Because the pre-mortem creates a culture of candor. People learn that they can voice unpopular ideas and not be punished for it. It also creates an environment where I'm surprised at the ideas that you come up with or this young captain comes up with, because a pre-mortem really harvests the different experience and ability of the people in the room. I don't know what's in your head, so how can I appreciate your perspective? But in a pre-mortem, I realize, wow, I never thought of it that way. So there's a chance for the people in the room to start to gain more respect for their colleagues.\n\nI would think that anonymity would be a useful tool here. Why do you not use that?\n\nAnonymity could be useful in environments that are usually very punitive, but in terms of creating a culture of candor, it works better if we're all face to face.\n\nDoes it sometimes get personal even ugly?\n\nI have never seen that happen surprisingly enough. No. No, because everybody knows that this is a made up failure. So it's not life or death, although it could be. And everybody knows that the intent is to improve the plan.\n\nCan you talk about how to encourage candid feedback generally? Again, it may be the more junior employees, but whoever it is that might have a valuable insight, how can you best float that insight up to leadership?\n\nI've wrestled with that issue for a while because most organizations say that they want insights, but they don't because insights are gonna mean that we have to change. And if I'm a mid-level manager and now I've got to change my supply lines, I've gotta change my staffing, can we just continue what we are doing and try to do it better? They'll say, we wanna be harmonious, so we're going to make decisions where everybody agrees. A harmonious decision is a terrible idea because that means that everybody has a veto. And so your chance of coming up with an innovation has been severely compromised.\n\nDo you ever have harmonious decisions in your personal life, maybe with your family?\n\nI am guilty of the delusion that we can have harmonious decisions. And despite personal experience, I I hold onto this goal.\n\nDo you personally routinely do pre-mortems, even just a quick in your head one, when you're about to make a decision?\n\nI do not do it when I, I make lots of decisions and so I don't do it automatically.\n\nDid you pre-mortem this interview today, Gary? That was a no. After the break, we asked the CEO of a startup if he would like to try Gary Klein's pre-mortem idea.\n\nI guess I disagree with Gary.\n\nI'm Steven Dubner. This is Free Economics Radio. We'll be right back in 2018. Will Coleman left his job as a partner at McKinsey, the consulting firm in order to launch a rideshare startup called Alto.\n\nAt Alto, we're elevating rideshare for both drivers and passengers. We offer a really differentiated service through W2 employees and company owned vehicles. So at Alto, you always know exactly what you're gonna get a safe, clean, high quality ride every single time.\n\nA lot of those words sounded as if they were chosen to be contra, Uber and Lyft.",

      "transcript_chunk": "st years. Just insane. Right?\n\nIt's, yeah, exactly. That's, that's what relentlessness looks like. I think it's, it's a question of like any big company, you know, ends up having a, a lot of layers of management and things like that is sort of the nature of how it works. But I still operate and I was always operating with Old Deep Mind as a, as a startup. Still large one, but still as a startup. And that's what we still act like today as with Google Deep Mind and acting with decisiveness and the energy that you get from the best smaller organizations. And we try to get the best of both worlds where we have this incredible billions of users surfaces incredible products that we can power up with our AI and our, and our research.\n\nAnd that's amazing. And you can, you know, that's very few places in the world you can get that, do incredible world class research on the one hand and then plug it in and and improve billions of people's lives the next day. That's a pretty amazing combination. And we're continually fighting and cutting away bureaucracy to allow the research culture and the relentless shipping culture to flourish. And I think we've got a pretty good balance whilst being responsible with it, you know, as you have to be as a large company and also with a number of, you know, huge products surfaces that we have.\n\nSo, a funny thing you mentioned about like the, the surface of the billion, I, I had a conversation with a guy named brilliant guy here at the British Museum called Irvin Finkel. He's a world expert at K Forms, which is a ancient writing on tablets. Yeah. And he doesn't know about Chad GBT or Gemini. He doesn't even know anything about ai. But his first encounter with this AI is AI mode on Yes. Google. Yes. He's like, is that what you're talking about? Yes. This AI mode. And then, you know, it's just, it's just a reminder that there's a large part of the world that doesn't know about this AI thing. Yeah,\n\nI know. It's funny 'cause if you live on X and Twitter, and I mean, it's sort of at least my feed, it's all AI and, and there's certain places where, you know, in the valley and certain pockets where everyone's just, all they're thinking about is ai. But a lot of the normal world hasn't, hasn't come across it yet. But,\n\nAnd that's a great responsibility to the their first interaction. Yep. The, the, the grand scale of the rural India or anywhere across the world like you\n\nGet to, right. And we want it to be as good as possible. And in a lot of cases it's just under the hood powering, making something like maps or search work better. And, and it's ideally for a lot of those people should just be seamless. It's just new technology that makes their lives more, you know, productive and, and, and helps them.\n\nA bunch of folks on the Gemini product and engineering teams spoken extremely highly of you on another dimension that I almost didn't even expect. 'cause I kind of think of you as the like deep scientists and caring about these big research scientific questions, but they also said you're a great product guy. Like how to create a thing that a lot of people would use and enjoy using. So can you maybe speak to what it takes to create a, a AI based product that a lot of people don't enjoy using? Yeah.\n\nWell I mean that, again, that comes back from my game design days where I used to design games for millions of gamers. People would forget about that. I've, I've had experience with cutting edge technology in product that, that, that, that is how games was in the nineties. And so I love actually the combination of cutting edge research and then being applied in a product and to power a new experience. And so I think it's the same skill really of, of, you know, imagining what it would be like to use it viscerally and having good taste coming back to earlier. The same thing that's useful in science, I think is, is can also be useful in, in product design. And I, I've just had a very, you know, always been a sort of multidisciplinary person.\n\nSo I don't see the boundaries really between, you know, arts and sciences or product and research. It's, it's a continuum for me. I mean, I only work on, I like working on products that are cutting edge. I wouldn't be able to, you know, have cutting edge technology under the hood. I wouldn't be excited about them if they were just run of the mill products. So it requires this invention, creativity, cap capability.\n\nWhat are some specific things you kind of learned about when you, even on the LLM side, you're interacting with Gemini, you like, this doesn't feel like the layout, the, the interface, maybe the trade opport between the latency, like how, how to present to the user, how long to wait and how that weighting is shown or the reasoning capabilities. Is there some interesting things? 'cause like you said, it's the very cutting edge. We don't know Yeah. How to present it, how to present it correctly. So is there some specific things you've, you've learned?\n\nI mean it's such a false evolving space. We're evaluating this all the time, but where we are today is that you want to continually simplify things. The in whether that's the interface I simplify. Yeah. Or, or the inter the what you build on top of the model. You kind of wanna get out of the way of the model. The model train is coming down the track and it's improving unbelievably fast. This relentless progress we talked about earlier. You know, you look at 2.5 versus 1.5 and it's just a gigantic improvement. And we expect that again for the future versions. And so the models are becoming more capable. So you've got, the interesting thing about the design space in, in, in today's world, these AI first products is you've gotta design not for what the thing can do today. The technology can do today, but in a year's time.\n\nSo you actually have to be a very technical product person because you've gotta kind of have a good intuition for and feel for, okay, that thing that I'm dreaming about now can't be done today, but is the research track on schedule to basically intercept that in six months or a year's time. So you kind of gotta intercept where this highly changing technology's going as well as the new capabilities are coming online all the time that you didn't realize before that can allow like d research to work or now we've got video generation, what do we do with that? This multimodal stuff, you know, is it, one question I have is, is it really going to be the current UI that we have today, these text box chats seems very unlikely give once you think about these super multimodal systems.\n\nShouldn't it be something more like minority report where you are, you are sort of vibing with it in a, in a co in a kind of collaborative way, right? It seems very restricted today. I think we'll look back on today's interfaces and products and systems as quite archaic in maybe in just a couple of years. So I think there's a lot of sp space actually for innovation to happen on the product side as well as the, the research side. And\n\nThen we are offline talking about the keyboard is the, the open question is how, when and how much will we move to audio as the primary way of interacting with the machines around us versus typing stuff.\n\nYeah, I mean typing is a very low bandwidth way of doing it. Even if you're a very fast, you know, typer. And I think we are gonna have to start utilizing other devices, whether that's smart glasses, you know, audio earbuds and eventually maybe some sorts of neural devices where we can increase the, the input and the output bandwidth to something, you know, maybe a hundred x of what is today.\n\nI think that, you know, underappreciated art form is the interface design because I think you can not unlock the power of the intelligence of a system if you don't have the right interface. The interface is really the way you unlock it's power. Yeah. It's such an interesting question of how to do that. Yeah. So how, how you would think like getting outta the way isn't real art form.\n\nYes. You know, it's the sort of thing that I guess Steve Jobs always talked about, right? It's simplicity, beauty and elegance that we want. Right. And we're not there. Nobody's there yet in my opinion. And that's what I would like us to get to. Again, it sort of speaks to like, go again, right? As a game, the most elegant, beautiful game. Can you, you know, that can you make an interface as beautiful as that? And actually I think we're gonna enter an era of AI generated interfaces that are probably personalized to you. So it fits the way that you, your aesthetic, your feel, the way that your brain works and, and, and, and the AI kind of generates that depending on the task, you know, that feels like that's probably the direction we'll end up in.\n\nYeah. 'cause some people are power users and they want every single parameter on the screen. Everything and everything based like perhaps me with a keyboard. Yeah. Keyboard based navigation. I'd like to have shortcuts for everything. And some people like the minimalism just\n\nHide all of that complexity. Yeah, completely. Exactly.\n\nYeah. Well I'm glad you have a Steve Jobs mode in you as well. This is great. Einstein mode, Steve Jobs mode. All right. Let me try to trick you into answering a question. When, when will Gemini three come out? This is before or after DTA six. The world waits for both. And what does it take to go from two five to three? Oh because it seems like there's been a lot of releases of two five, which are already leaps in performance. Hmm. So what, what does it even mean to Go to a new version? Is it about performance? This is about a complete different flavor of an experience? Yeah,\n\nWell so the way it works with our different version numbers is we, you know, we try to collect, so maybe it takes, you know, roughly six months or something to, to do a new kind of full run and the full productization of a new version. And during that time, lots of new interesting research iterations and ideas come up and we sort of collect them all together that, you know, you could imagine the last six months worth of interesting ideas on the architecture front. Maybe it's on the data front. It's like many different possible things. And we collect package that all up test which ones are likely to be useful for the next iteration and then bundle that all together.\n\nAnd then we start the new, you know, giant hero training run. Right? And, and then, and then of course that gets monitored and then at the end then there's the, of the pre-training, then there's all the post-training, there's many different ways of doing that. Different ways of patching it. So there's a whole experimenting phase there, which you can also get a lot of gains out. And that's where you see the version numbers usually are referring to the base model, the pre-train model, and then the interim versions of 2.5, you know, and the different sizes and the different little additions. They're often patches or post-training ideas that can be done afterwards off the same basic architecture. And then of course on top of that we also have different sizes, pro and flash and flashlight that are often distilled from the biggest ones.\n\nYou know, the flash model from the pro model. And that means we have a range of different choices if you are the developer of do you wanna pro prioritize performance or speed, right? And cost. And we like to think of this Pareto frontier of, of, you know, on the one hand the y axis is, you know, like performance and then the, the, the X axis is, you know, cost or latency and and speed basically. And we, we have models that completely define the frontier. So whatever your trade off is that you want as an individual user or as a, as a developer, you should find one of our models satisfies that constraint.\n\nSo behind diversion changes there is a big hero run. Yes. And then there's just an insane complexity of productization. Then there's the distillation of the different sizes along that preto front. And then as with each step you take, you realize there might be a cool product. There's site quests. Yes,\n\nExactly.\n\nBut and then you also don't want to take too many side quests because then you have a million versions Yes. And a million products. Yes,\n\nPrecisely.\n\nIt's very, it's very unclear. Yeah. But you also get super excited 'cause it's super cool. Yeah. Like how does even you look at vo very cool. Yeah. How does it fit into the bigger Yes. Thing Exactly.\n\nYeah. Exactly. And then you're constantly this process of converging upstream, we call it, you know, ideas from the, from the product surfaces or, or or from the post training. And, and even further downstream than that you, you kind of upstream that into the, the core model training for the next run. Right? So then the main model, the main Gemini track becomes more and more general and eventually, you know, a GI\n\nOne hero run at a time.\n\nYes, exactly. A few hero runs later.\n\nYeah. So sometimes when you release these new versions or every version really are, are benchmarks productive or counterproductive for showing the performance of a model\n\nModel. You need them and, and, but it's important that you don't over fit to them. Right? So they shouldn't be the end with a be all and end all. So there's, there's LM Marina or it used to be called Elemis, that's one of them that turned out sort of organically to be one of the, the main ways people like to test these systems. At least the chat bots. Obviously there's loads of academic benchmarks on from, from that test, mathematics and coding ability, general language ability, science ability and so on. And then we have our own internal benchmarks that we care about. It's a kind of multi objective, you know, optimization problem, right? You, you don't want to be good at just one thing. We're trying to build general systems that are good across the board and you try and make no regret improvements.\n\nSo where you improve in like, you know, coding, but it doesn't reduce your performance in other areas. Right? So that's the hard part. 'cause you, you can, of course you could put more coding data in or you could put more, I don't know, gaming data in, but then does it make worse your language system or or in, in your translation systems and other things that you care about. So it's, you've gotta kind of continually monitor this increasingly larger and larger suite of, of benchmarks. And also there's, when you stick them into products, these models, you also care about the direct usage and the direct stats and the signals that you're getting from the end users. Whether they're coders or, or or the average person using, using the chat interfaces.\n\nYeah. Because ultimately you wanna measure the usefulness. It's so hard to convert that into a number. Right. It's, it's really vibe based benchmarks across a large number of users and it's hard to know and I, it would be just terrifying to me to, you know, you have a much smarter model, but it's just something vibe based. It's not, not not quite working. That's such a scary because, and everything you just said, it has to be smart and useful across so many domains. So you, you get super excited 'cause it's all of a sudden solving programming problems it never been able to solve before but now it's crappy poetry or something. Yes. And it's just Right. I don't know. That's a stressful, that's so difficult\n\nTo balance. Yeah.\n\nTo balance. And because you can't really trust the benchmarks, you really have to trust the end users.\n\nYeah. And then other things that are even moister come into play. Like, you know, the style of the persona of the, the the system, you know, how it, you know, is it verbose? Is it succinct? Is it humorous? You know, and they and different people like different things. Yeah. So, you know, it's very interesting. It's almost like cutting edge part of psychology research or person personality research.",

      "transcript_chunk": "l, is that it's a very humane place in a lot of ways. The funding is not what it was. Let's get that straight right now in England, anywhere the arts are underfunded. It's bad it everywhere.\n\nAlthough here there's much more from the state,\n\nMuch, much more. And I'm sure that's going to be more pronounced once we lose, you know, our National Endowment of the arts, which will probably happen very soon in America. So that's absolutely true. I think there's a theater culture here that does not exist in America in general. There's a certain kind of value placed on the arts in England. And that is the thing about this tradition, right? We're part of a history. This is part of how we do things. It's very codified and there's constricting elements of that and then there's very wonderful elements to it. So you really do feel that that theater going is part of our culture. And that's why like, you know, in the royal court, they have seats in the bleachers for like 10 pence so everyone can come. 'cause it's part of the democracy that is part of the democracy.\n\nThat's how the Greeks thought of it as well.\n\nI thought of you and this play the other day we were up in Chester, England. It's an old Roman city. They've still got intact Roman walls and there's a thousand year old cathedral. And while we were there, we went to the races. The oldest horse racing track in the world is there. It's almost 500 years old. It's fun. And it's also weirdly identical to what it must have been almost 500 years ago. You've got animals, you've got people on them. And other than like the hats that the ladies wear, they call fascinators them being made of things that I'm sure materials that didn't exist 500 years ago. Otherwise it's pretty much the same. I was thinking that that's a tradition that carries on.\n\nMaybe it's because it's a form of entertainment where you can also bet, but it's social. Right? People get together in the sunshine you drink. And I was thinking about, well theater, you know, the same time that Chester was happening, like Shakespeare probably went to the Chester race course at some point, right? And I'm just thinking about the trajectories of these two things in some ways are very similar. They're analog things that are events. But the theater, sadly to me, and I gather to you as what would seem to be a different trajectory going forward, what do you think is lost for humankind?\n\nOh my God, listen, I'm a playwright, so clearly I like it. I think there are a lot of bad plays. I think it's a very hard medium. I think some of the curators are a little bit boring. But I think in terms of people getting together in a shared space and having a collective experience, it can be breathtakingly beautiful and important. And you know, again, I go back to the earliest democracies. I mean, it was a democratic requirement to go to the theater in ancient Greece, not for women. 'cause they weren't considered people or slaves, but still, okay. There was this idea that theater and democracy, they go together\n\nAnd the theater was often about the ideas of the day. It wasn't pure entertainment, we should say. Yes. Yeah,\n\nThere were ideas of the day, but then it was also, who knows? People were stabbing each other and killing the sheep and going crazy. I guess those are the ideas of the day. We're all going mad. But you know, there was a kind of psychic penetration that those plays engaged. There was a shadow side of human behavior and what it meant to be part of a social contract and also to be a leader of some kind or to be disenfranchised. Those are the plays that really move and interest me. Sometimes we go into phases of history where boulevard plays, I guess they're called, that are just lovely and entertaining and kind of throwaway, but fine in the moment, become more the order of the day.\n\nAnd then I think there are moments in history where the work can get more difficult.\n\nSpeaking of work that can be difficult. The street that we're on today, old Compton in soho, central London. Do you happen to know anything about who lived on the street in the past?\n\nGay people?\n\nI'm guessing that.\n\nThat's all I know. It's like a gay\n\nArea. Yeah, I'm guessing that's true.\n\nWho lived here?\n\nWell, many people. But the most noteworthy when I looked up was Wagner Ricard Wagner lived here.\n\nOh my God.\n\nI asked my favorite AI search engine what Wagner and David Ame have in common. Oh\n\nNo, we're both control freaks.\n\nDidn't gimme that. It may not know you well enough yet. It says David Ame and Rahar Wagner shares several notable commonalities rooted in their contributions to the performing arts. You like it so far? This is crazy. Particularly in how they both innovated within their respective mediums. Okay, so this is legit. Ready? There are four pioneering theatrical storytelling required. Wagner as a composer and Libre assist to revolutionize opera with this concept of that word. I can never say Guam. Yeah, yeah, I love that. And David Ame as a contemporary playwright known for pushing the boundaries of dramatic form and content. I don't know what you call the face you just made. It's all\n\nRight. It's like a Jewish fa. It's like by Larry David.\n\nOkay, if you say so. Number two, focus on music as central to their work. Okay, not a bad point. I mean, he was a musician, but okay. Number three, exploration of artistic process and creative tension. Wagner's works often depict artists, gods and mortals struggling with creation, ambition, and interpersonal conflict. While ame stereophonics similarly dramatizes the intense, often fraught dynamics. And number four, influence and controversy. Both have attracted controversy, Wagner fors, personal views, and the revolutionary nature of his art admi for legal disputes over the sources and inspirations for plays including Stereophonic and its alleged parallels to Fleetwood Macs history.\n\nSo, all\n\nRight.\n\nThat's what the AI machine has to say about you and Wagner. What do you think?\n\nNo comment.\n\nCan you gimme some kind of response to this? The lawsuit that the AI brings up? This was a Fleetwood Mac adjacent lawsuit. There was a settlement. I understand. Say what you can or will.\n\nI can't say anything. You know, I'm not a lamp. We settled it. I'm so glad we settled it.\n\nThe play did not have to change as a result of the lawsuit, I assume, or am I wrong? No. Was there a serious concern at some point that you might have to either shut down the show or rewrite\n\nParts? Well, we couldn't do anything with the lawsuit hanging over us. We wouldn't have been able to go to London or do a tour or anything like that. It was too\n\nFraught. I know the settlement amount is not made public as it never is in these cases, but I would assume that might have been a contribution to why it took a little while to recoup. Yeah, a chunk must have gone there.\n\nI mean, I don't think I'm allowed to say, but no,\n\nThe case had been brought by Ken Klay, a producer and engineer who worked on Fleetwood Max record rumors and who wrote a memoir called Making Rumors. There are, as I mentioned earlier, a lot of Fleetwood Mac parallels in Stereophonic from the makeup of the band itself to the way that the Peter character like Lindsay Buckingham in real life winds up taking over the project. There's also the fact that both Peter and Lindsay have a brother who's an Olympic swimmer. But now that the lawsuit has been cleared, Stereophonic is playing in London with sold out houses and rave reviews, and there will be a US tour later this year. I'm Steven Dubner.

Edward Jones, member, SIPC.\n\nSo what's different about the London production of Stereophonic from the New York production? The\n\nCast is, three of them came from New York and they all had the option to come, but the rest of 'em said, no, we don't wanna come. Okay. So we recast it.\n\nOh, they all did have the option.\n\nThey all had the option. Listen, it's a very, very draining play to do. They were just like, we've done it. We came out in January and we recast the farther roles and it was very, very hard because it's not just about getting people to play instruments and who are good actors. They have to feel a certain way. I mean, I really cast for the quality first and then it's like, okay, how can you act and can you play instruments?\n\nWhat do you mean cast for quality? First\n\nI wanted people who felt like artists and that they were a little bit weird. I didn't want people that felt like actors. A lot of actors are really good actors, but they feel like actors acting. I didn't want that for this show, and I really wanted to give the audience a very easy ramp into the kind of naturalism that we're asking in the play. And we found these actors, but there were like one or two like, okay, you could play that role. You're the only one. You could do it\n\nIn all of England,\n\nKind of. But that's what happened in in America too.\n\nSeveral cast members of Stereophonic in New York weren't really musicians. Tom Ppaca, who played the Peter character, had told me that before he started training for rehearsals, he only played what he called garbage guitar. But some of the London cast members are experienced musicians\n\nAt Playwright's Horizons. It was like, you know, what's that movie where they were getting the ship up the Hill\n\nFitzcarraldo?\n\nThat's what that was. It was a little bit like, oh my God, this is gonna kill me. Whereas, you know, three days in, they were playing all the songs and then it sounded great. They're musicians. They can do this\n\nWith zero disparagement toward American cast. Would it have been a different experience had you cast actors who were also musicians for the American version? I'm\n\nSure it would've been different. Would it have been better? Not necessarily because so much of the charm and the deliciousness of that experience was the meta story of can we make ourselves a band? Can we do this? Can we play instruments? It was wild seeing them step up to that plate for Will Brill, to learn how to play bass, and for Tom to learn the riff for Masquerade.\n\nThey\n\nWere so petrified, but inside of that fear was a kind of laser focus, like a minute to win it, and it brought out something very primal and thrilling that made its way into the performance. So I actually think it helps us in a certain way.\n\nI understand there's a new song for the London production. Yeah.\n\nIt's not in the production, in the play. Diana speaks about this song, which is from the first album, and it's the song that starts creeping back up the charts and then propels their album into success. So Will said, I'm gonna write that song, and then he said, I'm gonna give the cast something to do that's their own, to let the British cast shine for themselves and they kill it.\n\nI read that Brad Pitt's film production company is acquired rights to Stereo phonic. True.\n\nI don't know if they acquired the Rights. They're just my producers for the film, which I'm writing right now.\n\nOh, so you're writing\n\nThe film? I'm writing the film. I just decided not to sell it to a studio quite yet because I'd like to take my time and get it right and not have to take notes. Part of the problem is like, okay, you like the play now. What do you imagine the Hollywood version of it to be? I don't even know what it is yet. I have to redo the whole thing in my mind. Is\n\nThis gonna take another 10 years roughly?\n\nI hope to God not. I mean, I am working on it right now and I can't rush it, but I don't wanna do a bad movie and I really want it to have the integrity that the play had, but it can't be a play.\n\nCan you give a couple ideas just of how the film would be different from the play?\n\nI can't talk too much about the film 'cause I don't wanna jinx it. There are talkie speeches that will never be in this film. I love them and they're central to the play and they can't have anything to do with it. There's a character who is alluded to this receptionist who is an aspiring singer model person who sort of works her way through the band, who becomes a character in the film. I love writing her. It's a big thing in the play. This demarcation between public and private, those spaces are quite collapsed in the play. Everything becomes public 'cause they're just in the studio and there's no escape.\n\nIt's inspiring to me that you're so confident about this because it's a different kind of writing.\n\nIt's totally different and you have to embrace it, but I don't have an ego about it all, so I think that's where playwrights get in trouble, like, oh, my wonderful play. It's like, no, no, I've gotta kill. It's like Oedipus, kill the play. Marry the movie. You know what I mean? That's how I'm approaching it. I can't deify this play. This play is its own thing and there's things that I'm gonna keep because they're gonna work in the movie, but I have to figure out the proportions and stuff. It's just different. What\n\nAbout other plays? What are you working on?\n\nI'm doing a play for the public theater that I can't really talk about. It's a two part play.\n\nIs it contemporary? It\n\nIs, but it also spans something like 50 years. It's very different from Stereophonic. It couldn't be more different and I can't talk about it. I can't. I'm gonna get in trouble.\n\nDoes it engage more with the outside world than Stereophonic does, whether that's political engagement or whatnot? Yeah,\n\nIt does, but not because I felt an obligation to. I think that's where artists get into trouble when they're being pointed. Oh, let me write about the issue of the day because it's very important and I need to speak to it. I never do that. I don't like those kind of plays, and yet I've written one. Despite the fact that I dislike it. It came from a place of obsession and not understanding what I was examining. That's when I trust myself. When I'm coming from a place of rational inquiry, that's when I know I'm on the wrong track.\n\nI've heard you talk about this notion of an event, a thing that happens in a given place in time and that there's less and less appreciation of that, and I will say as a human, that worries me a little bit because we've lived the entirety of our civilization with that notion, so I don't know.

      "transcript_chunk": "lly have some better abilities at tells at reading players and figuring out what's going on. It ends up that I didn't, especially at the beginning, that I would fall for actually a lot of the biases that I'd studied, that I would make assumptions about players in the same way that they were making assumptions about me only I didn't quite realize just how wrong my assumptions were. But where it did help eventually is in kind of a metacognitive awareness that helped me identify those mistakes and fix them.\n\nBecause I had the vocabulary, I realized that I was focusing on the wrong things. I was focusing on what people looked like, things like that, you know, how they acted and what I should have been focused on, which is quite funny because it was most of what Walter Michelle's work had been for the last 20 years was on situational dynamics. What's going on at this table? How are these people relating to each other? How are they reacting? How do they act under these different situations? Once I realized that that was the most important thing, then my reading abilities improved and I was actually able to use my psychology background.\n\nBut there have been poker players who dismiss the people reading part of it and the social dynamic part of it, and just are quants, just play the probabilities and succeed. Yes. So what's to say that you're not overvaluing that part?\n\nNothing. And I think that they would probably say that I am overvaluing it. I think that you play to your strengths. The quant side is not my strength. I've mastered it to the point that I don't make horrible mistakes of addition and subtraction when I am calculating pod odds. But that's about it. I think the way that you become a great player is to figure out what works for you. What Eric taught me is that there's almost never a right way to do something, a right way to play in a certain situation. There's a right way to think about it.\n\nSo one gathers that it took you a little longer to get good than you maybe thought or would've liked, but then you really start improving on many dimensions, gameplay and strategy and stamina and self-control. And then in 2018, you have a really good year and you win a big tournament. Congratulations. Thank you. Which is super fun to read about. And then the next year you have a less good year. Let me just ask you to summarize on balance, especially the financial part, we are told that you took in over $300,000 in poker earnings, which sounds like a lot of money, but what did it cost you to get that $300,000 over?\n\nWhat length of time are we talking and then what were the expenses? 'cause you're traveling and staying in places, and I even wanna hear about the opportunity costs. In other words, did you come out ahead or no?\n\nWhat people don't realize when they look at tournament earnings, which is what that over 300,000 is, is that that's just earnings that does not count buy-ins, that does not count travel, that does not count all of those expenses. So this is over my entire time. This is over three years. When I first started playing, I was losing money and I was writing it off as kind of an expense for the book. This was experience, this was the cost of doing it. And then in 2018, when I won over $200,000, what I really took home was much less because I'd been traveling all over the world, I had played a lot of tournaments in which I hadn't cashed.\n\nSo I made, you know, much less than that. Maybe somewhere like 50,000, which is still very good. It's still an up year, but as you correctly say, there are also opportunity costs. You know, I wasn't taking any writing assignments. I was on leave from the New Yorker. I think at the end of the day it was still worth it because it enabled me to gain this experience. It enabled me to write the book, and it also gave me very valuable and marketable experience in other ways. After I'd had my wonderful year, I was invited to Davos to talk about my poker experience at the World Economic Forum. I've never been invited to Davos and that door would not have opened to me otherwise.\n\nSo this is one of those books that I really, really didn't want to end because the journey was so satisfying. And as you're learning about poker, we're learning it with you. But there was one thing that just kept nagging at me, which is how much does poker really relate to real life? And the more I read, the more I'd come to think the answer was not really that much, that most interactions we have with people either individually or in groups or society, that it doesn't really translate so much. But you were arguing that it really does. So I was really happy to see that your last chapter addressed this head-on, it's called the Ludic Fallacy.\n\nSo describe for us where this name comes from, Nasim Taleb, and how you wrestle with it. Because your book is essentially a willful suspension of this idea that you go at head on.\n\nSo Nasim Tala coined this phrase, the Ludic fallacy, which basically just tears apart the whole premise of my book. He says that you can't use games as a metaphor for life because games are neat and life is messy. And I actually wholeheartedly agree with the fact that life is messy and games are not. And I think that that actually makes them much more powerful as teaching tools. We don't learn well in life because it's a noisy environment, because you can't figure out what's going on because there are too many variables. It's too uncontrollable. What poker does is remove some of that noise, yes, in an artificial way, but in a way that actually allows you to access your thought process on a much deeper level, and then you can go to that noisy arena of life and learn to deal with it better.\n\nYes, poker doesn't have as terrible outcomes. You know, even no limit hold them where you can wager at all. All you're gonna lose are your chips or however much money is on the table in life. You can lose everything. But poker in teaching you how to deal with those losses on a game level, it then translates to a life level where all of a sudden you have the skills. You have the skills of emotional resilience, you have the skills of self-analysis to be able to get through those moments where life gets you down much more than poker ever could.\n\nCan you gimme an example of a good decision you've made in real life recently that you feel was directly influenced by your poker training?\n\nI think that I've started approaching relationships in a very different way. One of the things that poker really brings home is the sunk cost fallacy, which is something that plagues us a lot in our decision process, which is basically we look at things that we've already invested and rather than say, I can't change it, that's the past. I need to move on and make the best decision I can. Knowing what I know now, we actually don't do that. And instead we say, well, I've already spent so much, I might as well keep going. And this is true financially. You know, we put good money after bad when it's clear that an investment wasn't working. It's true personally, when we say, well, I've already spent so much time on this, I might as well finish it.\n\nInstead, we'd be much better suited to say, Hey, you know, that was time I can't get back, but what I can control is the time I spend now. So why don't I actually use it in a more productive, in a better way? Poker has actually forced me to confront that head on in my own life. And over the last few years, I've cut so many toxic relationships from my life that I realized had only been a part of my life because I'd invested so much time and energy into them. You know, friendships that I've had for a very, very long time that I realized weren't friendships that were draining me more than anything else.\n\nAll right, let me ask you last question. So you've gone to a lot of trouble in your life. I mean, I shouldn't say trouble. You've enjoyed it and done well with it, but you've gotten a PhD in psychology, then you immersed yourself in a very serious study of poker and traveled around the world to play and get better and ultimately become good and win and so on. For someone who isn't going to do any of that. How can we get better at basic decision making and self-control?\n\nA lot of the things that I try to distill in my book are the mini lessons that I learned for myself through doing this. So I hope that actually, I know this is a terrible answer because it sounds like read my book, but I hope that the book can actually serve as a cheat sheet for people. You know, I did this so that you don't have to. All it comes down to ultimately is something that you can, I think get without reading my book, which is learn to see yourself from an external perspective. Learn to be more mindful and more in tune with what you're thinking, what you're feeling. That's what will enable you to spot the errors that you make in your decision process.\n\nMost of the time we don't notice it because we don't pay attention to ourselves. We don't notice that we're making a decision while angry because we don't stop to assess, oh, I'm angry. What's making me angry? We just don't have that sort of internal conversation, and I think getting into the habit where just before you make any decision, before you do anything, you just stop, take a breath and take a moment to reflect and to check in with yourself and see, what am I thinking? Why am I thinking that? What am I feeling? Why am I feeling that way? Okay, now let me act now. Let me respond. I think that that's one of the most powerful tools that we can use without poker, without anything that will enable us to be better versions of ourselves and make better decisions.\n\nAt the end of the day, Nothing is all skill ever. I shy away from absolutes, but this one calls out for my embrace. Life is life. Luck will always be a factor in anything we might do or undertake. Skill can open up new vistas, new choices allow us to see the chance that others less skilled than us, less observant or less keen may miss, but should chance go against us. All our skill can do is mitigate the damage and the biggest bluff of all that skill can ever be enough.\n\nThat's the hope that allows us to move forward in those moments when luck is most stacked against us, the useful delusion that lets us push on rather than give up. We don't know. We can't ever know if we'll manage or not, but we must convince ourselves that we can, that in the end our skill will be enough to carry the day 'cause it has to be.\n\nThat was Maria Conno Cova and her book is called The Biggest Bluff, how I Learn to Pay Attention, master Myself, and Win.

The best way to get advice is to talk to other founders, especially founders of companies that want to grow, want to go big, want to build something truly special that scales fast. So the way to do that is to join Hampton, to talk to other high growth founders. That's where the real conversations happen.

And here's maybe a flavor of the kind of things you can prompt it to build the agent. For example, quote, create an agent that monitors our competitors pricing and sends me weekly updates. Another agent prompt. Build me an agent that onboards new customers by sending welcome emails, scheduling calls, and creating accounts. All right, one more. Make an agent that escalates urgent support tickets to managers. If you're running a business or you're part of a business and you're not using AI agents, you're not playing with 'em, you're not learning, you're not seeing, where are the places that can be leveraged, utilized to make you more efficient?

Now, dear friends, here's Ku Jen, What is the single biggest misconception the West has about China's economy today?\n\nThe biggest misunderstanding is somehow that a group of people, or even just one person runs the entire Chinese economy. It is far from the reality. It is a very complex, large economy. And even if there is an extreme form of political centralization, the economy is totally decentralized. The role that the local mayors, I call this the mayor economy, plays in reforms, but also driving the technological innovation that we're seeing right now. It is actually not run by just a handful of people. It's more decentralized than the US is. And I think more broadly, a big misunderstanding is really the relationship between Chinese people and authority.\n\nCan you elaborate on that?\n\nWell, you know, people think that somehow there's almost blind submission to authority. In China, we have a very nuanced relationship with authority, whether it is, you know, between kids and parents or students and their teachers, or with your bosses and the Chinese government, it's kind of the same thing. There's paternalism, they think that they're responsible for you, but deference, a certain amount of deference to authority is not blind submission. It's been written implicitly in our contract for thousands of years that in exchange for some deference, we are given stability, security, and peace, and hopefully prosperity.\n\nSo there is some element that we have in the west of freedom of the individual, so that a little bit of the rebel is allowed imbalance with the deference to authority.\n\nYeah, absolutely. Without that, how can you have this radical dynamic entrepreneurialism you see in China, if you don't have a sense of self, a sense of the fact that you can find opportunities, you look for opportunities, you, you, you drive opportunities. It's all self-motivated.\n\nIs there still a young kid in China that's able to dream, to be sort of the, the stereotypical Steve Jobs in the garage, start a business and change the world by doing so? There\n\nAre millions of young kids like that in China. They might not be thinking about changing the world. And this is where the Chinese approach to innovation is very different from the Silicon Valley one, I'd say. But they see opportunity, they see a country with a billion consumers. They see scale, they see speed, they see that with their dreams and the team that you have in China with engineers and the digital transformation, you can do so many things. And this generation of young people think about transforming their local economy. I, I think we're gonna get into this, but it's no longer gonna just be manufacturing. The young kids are entrepreneurs.\n\nWell, let's stand the big picture, but big. But there's a, a perception that China is a communist country. So to what degree is China a capitalist country and to what degree is it a communist country?\n\nI've rarely seen a more capitalist society than China. From the pure economic side. I've rarely seen companies that are as competitive as Chinese companies, people as ambitious and obsessed with making money as Chinese people. Kind of ruthless actually. And look, you know, consumers, shop firms invest. If you invest well financially, you'll get great returns. What is not capitalistic about the Chinese economy? At the same time, the social fabric is highly socialist. First of all, the state or enterprises dominate in many of the sectors.\n\nThe state banks control the financial system. We often talk about common prosperity, about equal opportunity just and fair society, but even, you know, daily stories, a walk in the park behind my my parents' apartment, you're gonna find at least 50 organized social groups on a daily level, singing, dancing, exercising, doing whatever these fantastic idiosyncratic hobbies they have, getting together every single day and free courses for the elderly and retired, right, that sense of communalism, that sense of belonging, that strive for harmony at the societal level.\n\nIs there,\n\nSo just to go back to something you said, there is a value for competition culturally. So on, on the business side and the economic side, there is sort of a cultural value of people competing in a meritocratic way.\n\nCompetition is ferocious in China, especially when it comes to Chinese companies, but also in education. I should be thankful that I'm not, you know, born later that I am, because I thought China was pretty competitive already going to the schools and studying for the exams. It is a different level today. Competition is not necessarily in the culture. I'd say it's driven really by the changing economic and social circumstances of the day. The Chinese companies are all hardworking, they're all going after the market share. They all kind of wanna do the same thing. You know, it's not quite like in the US where you open a coffee shop. Well, next door I'm gonna, you know, open a bagel shop, right?\n\nIn China, the coffee shop does well, everybody wants to open the same coffee shop. And I think, again, I'm sure we're gonna get to this, but there's a lot of that kind of competition, which really drives the world sometimes crazy of replication. But it's because it's not easy, right? It's not easy to make money in the education system. There are not enough jobs for the young people. So how do you get ahead, how as, let's say, if you're part of a lower stratum society, how are you gonna make sure that your children are gonna have a better life than you? You invest in education, so everything is about competition in a country with 1.3 billion people, that's somewhat to be expected.\n\nLet's go back to the roots of that. So you described that China's economy model is rooted in its history. So can we talk about Confucianism? Can you explain to what degree those roots run back to Confucianism and in general to other parts of Chinese history?\n\nYeah, Confucianism is more of a moral philosophy than let's say religion or a belief system. It prioritizes social harmony above anything else. It's not about metaphysics, but more about ethics. And at the individual level, the responsibility, the duties are all meant to preserve that social order. So it's phil piety, it is loyalty, it is how to be a Chinese gentleman. But things like saving frugality is part of the moral discipline. Education is part of the moral cultivation.\n\nSo there's a very strong emphasis that you as a citizen have a responsibility to contribute to society as a whole.\n\nOn the education side, a part of confusionism is a, is a value for meritocracy. So how does that permeate the education system in China? You've already spoken to it a little bit, the value of competition in that it's already getting more and more intense. But it would be very interesting to get your understanding of the education system, its history, and as it stands today,\n\nIf China were relatively successful economically, a huge part of the reason is by and large it's been meritocratic. That is changing somewhat now, but the only way that you have still that many poor people, especially a couple decades back, still be in harmony with society, seeing all these rich people, you know, make tons of money and you're still belonging to that lower stratum. The only reason is that you believe that your children have a future through meritocracy. And even though it's imperfect is highly imperfect, standardized testing, all this competition, all of the, the, the hours and the tutorials to studying for standardized exams.\n\nWell that is a very realistic scenario in China because there's that many people, you know, when I was growing up in school, we had 60 people per class, and there were 10 classes in one grade. Now imagine that many people applying for colleges in the, in the American way, how many essays would have been written and need to be scrutinized, but also that gives room for total corruption if you, you know, if you know what I mean, just connection based. And actually the standardized exams, as imperfect as it is to select talent, is still by and large fair. And that's how that whole generation of, you know, entrepreneurs, but bureaucrats, government officials were selective.\n\nYou look at the Chinese premiers, the presidents of the past, they, they all went to great schools, you know, a lot of them were engineers. And same thing for civil servants. It has changed somewhat. You know, the meritocracy I think is, is eroding in China. I'm worried about that because it is fine that you get into a good university based on your own merit, but finding a job now becomes much less meritocratic. People with connections get jobs more easily than than others. So of course, this is not just a unique Chinese phenomenon, it's actually everywhere. But I guess what I'm saying is that that meritocracy, which was so fundamental to the Chinese, ancient Chinese education system, by the way, civil servants were selected based on standardized exams in the past.",

      "transcript_chunk": "It wasn't necessarily a fed accompli that I would have this kind of hit or anything like that. I was taken to task by the critics and I was considered really polarizing and difficult.\n\nLet's back up for a second. Please say your name and what you do.\n\nDavid Ame is my name, and playwright is my game.\n\nAME has been a playwright for a few decades now. His work was typically staged in regional or repertory or experimental theaters, but never under the much brighter lights of Broadway or the West End. That changed last year with a play he wrote called Stereophonic.\n\nStereophonic is a play about a dysfunctional family and art making and about the struggle to become an artist.\n\nIt's another way of saying that Stereophonic is a play about the mind of David Admi.\n\nI always work off of tropes in the culture, but then it's always really a way for me to talk about me. The\n\nPlot of Stereophonic is so slender that it barely sounds like a plot. A five piece band is struggling to record their second album. The band very much resembles Fleetwood Mac, at least superficially. There are two sound engineers also, and the entire play takes place in California Recording studios in the late 1970s. That's it. But that slender plot supports an entire universe of emotion. Some of the most psychologically astute writing you'll ever hear on a stage. And then there's the music. Stereophonic is not a musical, not even close, but the music says a lot of things the characters aren't able to, and the music was written by Will Butler, a longtime member of the Band Arcade Fire last year as we were trying to make a series about the strange economics of the live theater industry, Stereophonic had just moved to Broadway from a well-received off-Broadway run at Playwrights Horizons.\n\nI saw the play a few times. I loved it. And we wound up making a pair of episodes about it. We interviewed producers, cast members, and David Ame Stereophonic went on to be nominated for more Tony's than any play in history. And it won five, including Best Play. And so when I was recently in London for some other tapings and I saw that Stereophonic was in rehearsals for its debut in the West End, I asked AME if he would meet up in a recording studio and tell us everything he's been up to. As you'll hear, he is a fun person to have a conversation with. He is super smart, but also earnest. He's remarkably candid.\n\nHe's rarely mean-spirited except toward himself sometimes, and he's consistently interesting, at least to me. I hope you'll agree. Today on Freakonomics Radio, after a Stereophonic size success, what can David Ame possibly do? Now,\n\nThis is Freakonomics Radio, the podcast that explores the hidden side of everything with your host Steven Dubner.\n\nOoh,\n\nDavid Ame grew up in Brooklyn in a turbulent Syrian Jewish family. He describes the turbulence well in a memoir called Lot Six. We also learned that AME started reading the New York Times when he was two. He saw his first Broadway musical at five. He went to college at Sarah Lawrence and then grad school for playwriting at both Julliard and the University of Iowa. And then came the hard work the last time we spoke, which was just as Stereophonic was starting to explode. You said there had been times when you thought about just quitting playwriting, but you didn't, and now you've been writing plays for roughly 30 years, and when you look around you realize that almost nobody really does that anymore.\n\nYeah, I\n\nThink it's true. I sort of made some decisions and choices that compromised me in terms of the kinda life I would have. I was willing to do that because I knew that my purpose here is really to do a certain kind of writing and to be very, very truthful and exploratory in the kind of work I do. And if I can't have that freedom to explore and sort of mull over what I believe the truth is for me in this kind of dramatic dialectical context of a play, I don't wanna do it. And I don't know if I wanna do anything. You know what I mean? That kind of feels like that is my reason for being. So I made a lot of sacrifices to get to write these plays.\n\nWhat do you mean by sacrifices?\n\nI would live in people's homes. I'd live in attics, I'd live in basements, I'd find patrons. Essentially. I went into an enormous amount of debt, credit\n\nCard\n\nDebt, credit cards, and you know, I couldn't pay my taxes. The problem is they tax grants, which prior to Reagan they didn't do. So when artists got grants, if I got Guggenheim, let's say, which I was fortunate enough to get one, then I would use that money to try to pay some of my debt. The grants were a huge boon, and then suddenly it became the bane of my existence because I was like, oh my God, I'm running from the tax man. You also go into a little bit of denial, like, I've got all this money. Hooray, and then you want to go out and celebrate and it's like, oh no, I've got this albatross of these taxes.\n\nThat makes me sad because I feel like someone should have said to you, Hey, the first thing you need to do is take 30% of that and just set it aside. But nobody said that to you.\n\nNobody said it. But I also think maybe I wouldn't have listened because I wanted to experience the ecstasy of money.\n\nWere you somewhat hedonistic?\n\nYes.\n\nOn what?\n\nWell, it took myself out for nice dinners. Maybe I bought a little outfit here and there. That\n\nDoesn't sound hedonistic for\n\nMe. It was, it's so funny because people thought I was so rich. I remember having dinner with a professor of mine from college, from my undergraduate after my first play opened in New York, and she's like, you must be doing so well now financially. And I said, they paid me $7,000.\n\nWhat was she a professor of?\n\nShe taught literary theory and literature.\n\nI would've thought she would understand the economics of theater a little bit.\n\nShe had not the vaguest idea. I saw her recently, we had dinner again a couple months ago, and she said, I remembered that day really vividly because it was such a shock to my system. People don't understand that playwrights make literally nothing and just how broken it is. And of course now it's just we're going down even a darker black hole, which I didn't even think was possible. But of course it always is.\n\nDuring the 10 or 11 year gestation period of Stereophonic, which is the show that people now know you for, talk about how close you came or how many times you came close to quitting playwriting. What\n\nI realized making Stereophonic was that I couldn't give up. This is the kind of torture I think that gets crystallized in the play itself because I think people realize I love this too much and the thing that I love is killing me and I will never stop loving it. That's why the play rings. I think with the intensity that it has, because I was really living it for real. I made the play over 10 years. I thought it was never going to get done at some point. I mean, it's hilarious in a dark way because it does mirror the trajectory of the play because the play is about this album that's like never getting finished and everyone's going insane. And people are wondering like, am I gonna make it alive out of this studio to see this record come out?\n\nAnd I was really feeling that.\n\nAnd yet that was the thing that kept you in. It didn't make you run from it.\n\nIt was a bit of a Beckett situation. You know, I think about the end of St. Sternberg's play. I think it's a dream play where the character says you wanna stay and you wanna go, and wild horses are tearing you apart in both directions simultaneously. And I really felt those two opposite emotions with equal intensity. I learned how to be quite disciplined during that period and very, very rigorous and just put my emotions to the side as much as possible. But there were times when I really thought I was losing my mind. I had holes in my clothes and I couldn't afford anything. I mean, it got really, really bad for me. And my director, Daniel Kin, was actually quite worried about me.\n\nEven to the point where when we were in previews of Playwrights Horizons, I made sort of a dark joke. We were up in the roof, he was smoking a cigarette. And then I sort of alluded to the fact that, well, if it doesn't go so great, maybe I'll just, you know. And I kind of nodded downward and he just burst into tears. 'cause I think he was so worried about me.\n\nThe relationship you two have along with Will Butler is I think quite remarkable because you were collaborators For years and years and years before there was a play. Yeah, yeah. I mean, you were a team. You formed a band, essentially.\n\nWe just sort of decided that we would have unconditional faith in each other. It was some sort of spiritual contract that we made. I don't know how we made it or why we did it, but we intuitively just knew that we could trust each other and that we were going to be really decent with each other. And that I was going to learn how to be civilized, which I maybe wasn't prior to this process because I am quite controlling and I am very demanding. Daniel sat me down prior to the process and said, listen, you have a reputation of being very demanding. This is how I need to work. Can you work this way? And I said, yeah. Just\n\nTo be clear, you drafted these guys into your band several years before anyone would've ever heard of Stereophonic and they worked for essentially Free For years,\n\nFor 10 years.\n\nSo this is Will Butler, who was at the Point still in Arcade Fire.\n\nHe was in Arcade Fire, this was 2013. He's so smart. He's so dramaturgical Will he has the Mind for theater. And that was something I did not know. It's an accident.\n\nYou went to him because you were able to find a connection. Yes. Or you reached out and he said Yes.\n\nI reached out to Arcade Fire period. I was like, I want Arcade Fire to do it. I dunno,\n\nJust because you love them. I love\n\nArcade Fire. And I just thought there was something about the en anthemic quality of some of the songs, especially in their first album. I was like, there's something about the intensity of this and the sort of fever of some of these songs that I think will rhyme with what I want for this show and I love them. And then they were all busy. No, no, no, I can't do it. And Will was like, well, I'll meet with you. And I just thought, I like this guy. He's a bit like Peter Pan or something. I mean he's kind of iconoclastic for a rock star. He's a sweet, sweet soul. He's goofy and he's silly and he's really fun and he's very, very brainy. When we were doing my show, he moved to Cambridge and got a degree in public policy from Harvard in the middle of recording for Arcade Fire.\n\nHe's a unique corn in the world of rock music.\n\nThen Daniel Alkin is a working director in New York. His father, I think was head of the National Theater here in London for a time. Yeah,\n\nHe was. Yeah.\n\nSo when you say, you know, we all made this contract where we agreed to be good to each other and to collaborate in a certain way, I could see why you would wanna do that, right? You're the writer and you need them, a director and a musician to write what is a very essential piece of this play. But what was in it for them?\n\nI have no idea. I think Daniel, you know, we went to Sundance together, they have this theater lab and I developed my first real play there called The Evil Doers. Daniel saw the reading, which was quite extraordinary. Michael Stu Bar was in it and it was great. He got really jazzed about it and bought, I wanna work with this guy. So we had been talking about doing something together and I remember thinking, this is the play for Daniel. Like I saw it in my mind's eye and then I just went, that's for Daniel.\n\nWhat did your script look like over the years and how much archival stuff is there? Are there cartons full of paper versions? Was it all on a computer?\n\nI'm really bad at archiving myself 'cause I'm so disorganized. What I was doing in the beginning was just taking notes of every single thing that I could learn about a recording process in the seventies, jargon equipment, what they would say to each other, what their problems would be. Then I would riff on it and make dialogue. It was a very scattershot process. My assistant now is saying like, what's your process? Explain to me so I can help you. And I'm like, I can't explain it 'cause I don't know what I'm doing. I'm just following my intuitions. Did\n\nAll the characters already exist when all this was going on?\n\nNo, no, no. They didn't exist. I didn't have an engineer for the first part because I didn't. I was just like, oh, it's a band. They go into the studio. I didn't know anything. And then I said, okay, I'll have an engineer. And then I showed it to John Kilgore, who is this very famous engineer producer who works with Philip Glass and Steve Reisch and all these people. And John was amazing. And we said, could you be our advisor? He read through what I had and he said, why is there only one engineer? He needs an assistant. And so that opened up the dramaturgical thing of like, oh, there's two guys and now it becomes like Rosen Krantz and Gild Stern. So then that became the next draft. I developed it in workshops. So I do it like 10 or 15 pages at a time, 20 pages here and there.\n\nI think for people who aren't accustomed to making things, especially over a really long period of time, they show up, they buy a ticket, they see it, and in the case of your play, it's a long play. So maybe feel like you're getting money's worth. It's three hours long. But I think it's not natural to think about the ingredients or the process. You know, if you and I were to go to have a really nice dinner somewhere, we don't stop to think about all the growing and planting, harvesting, preparing, education that goes into that one meal. But it's years and years and years and years. And similarly, what you're describing now is years and years of minute work that's gone into this thing that people will show up and buy a ticket and love it or not love it, whatever, and then it's over.\n\nDoes that get to you that people don't generally think about or understand what it takes to make something like this?\n\nWell that's why I wrote the play. I heard an interview, I think it was about Barbara Streisand. Barbara Streisand was in the studio and they were playing these violins and she said, one of these, it's flat. And they were like, what are you talking about? They were like 12 violins. And she goes, which one? Play it you. That's the kind of expertise that when you hear the anecdote you're like, oh my god, Barbara Streisand doesn't brag about this. Hey, do you know what I do? I have to listen to all these flat instruments. She's just focused on the work at hand. I find there's such nobility in that for me, that artists often don't have to display their expertise, they just do their work. I find that very beautiful.\n\nThere are romantic relationships among the characters in your play that ebb and flow. But even among those for whom there's no romantic relationship, being in a band is a little bit like being married to several people simultaneously. Right.\n\nI like the idea that you're getting to, there's something in there, but I don't understand it. The\n\nReason I'm asking is that I was in a band and I quit as we were kind of at the brink. We had gotten a record deal, we were in pre-production on our first record and I decided this was not the life that I wanted. We were on Arista records. It\n\nWas oh\n\nMy. And I'd been working toward it for\n\nClive Davis. Yeah,\n\nClive came to CBGBs to see us play and then he led us out to his stretch limousine. It was very called. He put his silk scarf around my neck. Oh my God.\n\nOh my God.\n\nAnd we went up to his office the next day and he had Aretha Franklin get on the phone with us to tell us how great,\n\nOh my, what\n\nIt was bomb Steven. But anyway, once we got into the making of the record and once I had exposure to people who were successful, I realized it was not the healthy lifestyle for me.",

      "transcript_chunk": "If you are looking to have a good conversation with someone who wield great political power, when is the best time to have that conversation? The most obvious answer is while they're in office. But when they're in that vortex, they have strong incentives to not speak candidly or to just promote their agenda. Another common time for a conversation like this is the exit interview, but the exit interview can get tied up with exhaustion or relief, regret. Eventually, this person may publish their memoirs and they'll do some interviews to promote the book, but by then they may be in factory production mode churning out the same answers in every interview.\n\nSo when is the best time to have a good conversation with a person like this? Is there maybe a sweet spot sometime after leaving office, but before publishing their memoirs? Maybe while they're still writing and spending all their waking hours sifting through their accomplishments and their what could have beens? Let's hope that is the sweet spot, because that's when we caught Anthony Blinken for the conversation you are about to hear. Blinken was Secretary of State for the entirety of the Biden presidency. He was considered one of Biden's favorite and most trusted allies. Their time together goes back to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.\n\nBlinken has spent more than three decades working on US foreign policy. He also served in the Clinton and Obama Administrations. Secretary of State is sometimes described as the second most important job in the world. Past office holders include Thomas Jefferson and John Quincy Adams, George C. Marshall, and Henry Kissinger, whom Blinken spoke with regularly while Blinken was secretary. Here's how Kissinger once described the Secretary job. Each success only buys an admission ticket to a more difficult problem. Today on Freakonomics Radio, we interrupt Anthony Blinker's memoir writing to talk about Blinken himself as well as Joe Biden, Donald Trump, Gaza, China, Syria, Iran, Russia, and the rest of the world.\n\nThis is Freakonomics Radio, the podcast that explores the hidden side of everything with your host Steven Dubner.\n\nSo first of all, just say your name and what you do.\n\nTony Blinken and former Secretary of State.\n\nYou shortened it quite a bit. I did. You could have gone on for hours. Three presidential administrations, correct.\n\nThree presidential administrations starting with President Clinton through President Obama and then President Biden.\n\nI'm sorry to be so basic here, but why Anthony and not Anthony?\n\nI was apparently supposed to be David, and then my cousin beat me to birth and was David. My parents had a friend, a sculptor whose first name was an Anthony. They liked the name and there it was. And ever since I've had to deal with the fact that there's no H in it.\n\nSo while we're at it, you have a pretty interesting family background. Can you give me that? What I really want to know is the degree to which your family background informed the way you think about the world, including the promises of the world, but also the perils.\n\nI think so many of us are the product and no small measure of the conversations we have around our dining room tables, our kitchen tables, and the stories we hear from our families. That's very much me. I had my father's father, my grandfather who came to the United States at the turn of the last century fleeing pilgrims in what is now Ukraine. He was able to build a life in the United States. He was welcomed here, built an extraordinary life, sent his three sons to Ivy League schools.\n\nWhat did he do for a living?\n\nHe started out as a lawyer. He even practiced before the Supreme Court, but ultimately he started a company and did very well with that, but was also just deeply engaged in the life of the mind, but also in the public square back in the 1940s, as the question of Israel was emerging and the question of a Jewish state, one of the arguments against the United States supporting the Declaration of Independence by Israel was the notion that it wasn't economically viable. And at the time, my grandfather produced a study that was both definitive and considered somewhat dispositive to the question showing that in fact it would be economically viable. That contributed to the policy decision the government made at the time to recognize Israel from my grandfather.\n\nHe saw like so many others, this country as a a beacon of hope and maybe the last best hope. My late stepfather, Samuel Piar, he was born in Bok Poland before the war that was a center of Jewish life in Poland. He went to school in bok with about 900 other children. He's the only one of those 900 to have survived the war. He lost his mother, his father, his little sister, Frida. First, there was a ghetto and bi stock when the country was dominated by the Soviets, and then of course it gave way to the Nazis. He was sent to work camps and then concentration camps, death camps, myonic, Dachau, Auschwitz somehow survived at the very end of the war.\n\nHe was on a death march out of one of the camps in Bavaria. He made a break for it along with a couple of his friends, and somehow they made it into the woods. They hit out during the day. They moved around at night, and then one day as they were hiding, they heard this deep rumbling sound and they looked out from where they were and they saw something they'd never seen before. A large tank, not with the Iron Cross, but with a five pointed white star. My stepfather ran to the tank, which was probably a pretty foolhardy thing to do.\n\nHe's how old at this point. He\n\nIs at this point, about 16, he makes a run for the tank and the hatch opens up and a large African American GI looks down at him. He then says the only three words in the English language that he knew his mother had taught him these words before the war. God bless America. The GI lifts him up into the tank and in effect, into freedom. Again, America as literally the only hope that was infused in me, and I wanted to do my small part hopefully in continuing in some fashion. That tradition,\n\nYour stepfather many years later, talking about you working now in government, he said he took in what happened to me when I was his age, and I think it impressed him and it gave him another dimension when he has to worry today about poison gas in Syria. This is during the Obama administration. He almost inevitably thinks about the gas with which my entire family was eliminated. Is that an accurate connection?\n\nIt is. That's right. The resonance, the connections, the progression of history is something that resonates powerfully with me. It's also personal because of these family stories. And then you know, Steven, I had the extraordinary experience of living outside of my own country as a young boy. We moved to Paris from New York when I was nine years old. My mother had remarried and off we went to Paris. That was also extraordinary because it gave me an opportunity to see my own country through the eyes of others. This was an incredibly charged time. The early 1970s, the Cold War was on, the Vietnam War was on, we had conflicts in the Middle East, Afghanistan. You wind up getting into discussions, debates, arguments with your classmates, and you find yourself almost in the role of a a junior diplomat because inevitably you're kind of representing your own country,\n\nGiven the climate of the times, especially having to do with the war in Gaza and many, many events surrounding that. I'm guessing there are some people who say, oh, well, Tony Blinken, now that I've heard the stories of the persecution his family faced because they were Jewish, and now that I know he's got Jewish roots and professes, that that persecution was kind of the root of his worldview about wanting to, let's say, alleviate suffering, defend people and so on. But I'm sure some people are thinking, well, the simple fact that he's got Jewish roots means that he's in the bag for Israel. That's a unfortunately typical reduction that's happening in our political conversations these days. So let's say I were to say that to you, oh, well, you may defend your and the Biden Administration's record on Israel and many, many other things, but persuade me that you're not biased, and what I'm really asking is how can you perform your abilities as a political figure, as a civil servant, whatever it is, while incorporating the strength of your personal and family background without biasing yourself against others?\n\nSure. And look, I get that. I understand that reaction. I certainly heard it. I guess I'd say two things, Steven. First, I'm in the bag for the United States. I had the extraordinary privilege of representing our country for four years around the world as Secretary of State, and first foremost, my job was to do my best to try to represent the interests of my country, my fellow citizens, as well as our values. There are plenty of judgments to go around about whether I, and we did that well and differently or badly. That's for others to make, but that's what my job was, and that's what I tried to do every day. Second, it's precisely because of this extraordinary form of experience of our family stories and the suffering that my own immediate relatives had gone through that I think, and I hope made me deeply sensitive to the suffering of anyone, Jewish or Palestinian, of whatever nationality, of whatever background, of whatever faith.\n\nI think it wouldn't do justice to my own history and that legacy to not be deeply, deeply sensitive to the plight of others. There's no hierarchy of suffering. When I looked at what happened on October 7th, it resonated deeply with me because it was the worst slaughter of Jews since the Holocaust. I felt that very strongly, but I also felt very strongly what happened every day after October 7th, including the horrific suffering of Palestinian boys and girls, women and men who were caught in this horrific crossfire of Hamas' initiation, something that they hadn't started and were powerless to stop.\n\nWhen\n\nYou look back over the history of Israel, how can you best describe how this country went from being a largely celebrated Middle East democracy, which was under attack almost continuously by its neighbors who oppose western values, which aligned Israel further with the US and Israel defended itself, and it got stronger militarily as well as economically, and that was the reputation for a few decades to now where the public sentiment globally in many quarters at least, has been shifted towards basically called a settler colonial villain. That's the progressive left configuration at least. Can you describe the degree to which that was a change in perception, a change in facts on the ground, things that Israel did prima facia wrong to bring that reputation onto itself versus campaigns against it, et cetera?\n\nYeah, so much goes into that. We could probably spend the entire time on that question, but just a few thoughts. What you'll hear many say, especially those who went through the Holocaust, went through World War ii, is they despised us and disdained us when we were weak and meek going off to the slaughter. Now they despised us and us for being strong. It's a worldview that in a sense, no matter what you do, the haters are gonna hate.\n\nIt's also a good political strategy for autocrats in that part of the world. A different version of bread and circuses, I guess.\n\nYes, there's something to that as well. Part of the problem that we're living through right now is an absence of any kind of historical grounding, a lack of context, and so in brief, what happened in the Middle East with Israel, when Israel was founded, when it declared its independence, there was a partition that was recognized and voted by the United Nations. It was not accepted in the moment by Arab countries, which urge the Palestinians to push back against it. There was a war of independence, and of course many Palestinians were made refugees just as a roughly equal number of Jews were, made refugees from Arab countries at the time, and then you had decades during which Arab countries didn't accept Israel's existence.\n\nYou had wars, you had 67, you had 73, but then ultimately you had a change and a breakthrough. Egypt, Jordan, and then others came around and then efforts were made to finally resolve the question, including the question for the Palestinians. But unfortunately in that period, Palestinian leadership rejected many of the settlements that were proposed.\n\nWe're up to Oslo now or\n\nWe're up to Oslo and then Camp David and right up to the early two thousands.\n\nI had an interesting conversation the other day with a young person who was really interested in this political story and definitely knew quite a bit about the current events. They, however, did not know about the Oslo Accords at all, which surprised me. 'cause to me it doesn't seem that long ago and it was foundational. This gets to what you were saying a bit ago about living in a, I don't know if it's fair to call it an a historic age.\n\nI think that's probably pretty fair. You've got Oslo, you've got what President Clinton did at Camp David, where the offer on the table for the Palestinians was about 97% of the West Bank, and they said no, the leadership couldn't say yes.\n\nAnd if you had to explain those decades of rejection, those various plans, maybe going back to Raffa and up through Hamas, how would you shorthand it?\n\nI think part of it was a rejection actually of a two state solution. Every time things were moving in a positive direction. Oslo, you mentioned, and then later in the early two thousands, the Arab Peace Initiative, which was a big moment when Arab countries got behind a two state solution who came along immediately and tried to literally blow it up. Hamas perpetrating horrific terrorist attacks after Oslo and after the RPS initiative. The biggest opponent of a two state solution throughout has been Hamas. One of the things I say to Israelis and others who say, oh, we can't make an accommodation with the Palestinians now because it would be to give Hamas a big victory. No, it's exactly the opposite.\n\nThe ultimate defeat of Hamas and everything it represents would be the realization of a Palestinian state with a secure Israel. So you have decades of Arab rejection, then you have a couple of decades of Palestinian rejection, but what do we have over the last 15 or so years in effect, Israeli rejection, a belief that the status quo could prevail and that it didn't need to accommodate the rightful aspirations of Palestinians for a state of their own. This is, in some ways not hard to understand. The Israelis got out of Gaza in 2005. They pulled up every settlement, every settler. What happened, Hamas came in, managed to push out the more moderate Palestinian authority, and then repeatedly launched attacks against Israel from Gaza, ultimately culminating in October 7th.\n\nSo from the Israeli perspective, it's, wait a minute, we gave up the land, we gave up the settlements, we got out, and what did we get? We got Hamas similarly in the north after occupying southern Lebanon for 18 years. They left and what happened, Hezbollah came in and launched attacks against Northern Israel repeatedly. So if you put yourself in their shoes, I think their feeling was, you know, decades of rejection by Arabs. Then we had extremist groups who again rejected our existence and sought our destruction, but then finally they got to a place where they thought they had a, a status quo that could prevail, where after the second Intifada, there was relative quiet and relative calm, and I think Israelis were lulled into a sense that, okay, we don't have to do anything.\n\nTell me any regrets you're willing to admit about how you and the Biden administration handled the Gaza War?\n\nOh, look, their regrets every day. There can't not be. When you look at the toll of the suffering, as we were looking at it, we were trying to accomplish a few things at the same time.",

      "transcript_chunk": "ial ideas. Obviously working closely with the team at the British Museum. Once we have those, we will then cost it and understand what ballpark we're talking about. But we already know the scale of work that's required. Here is 35% of the galleries of the British Museum. It's significant. It's hundreds of millions. The question is just, is it past 500?\n\nA rough estimate I've read is in the neighborhood of a billion pounds or a billion dollars perhaps.\n\nYeah, I mean that figure is bandied about a lot, but it was something that was bandied about a few years ago and it stuck. 'cause it's a nice round number. It's a very eye catching number. This is what you do with old projects, especially with architecture. There's the wonderful period of infinite possibility and ideas and you start by thinking you know all the things you could do and then of course there's this process of that butting up against the reality of your resources, whether it's a massive rebuild or an exhibition or an essay. It's not about the scale, it's about the process. If you start any of those projects with, well, here's the results I have, so what can I do within those parameters, you end up with something inherently disappointing. You need to start from an expanded field of possibilities. You've\n\nTalked about how important it is for any museum to be able to sum up its purpose in one sentence, so gimme your sentence on the British Museum, especially as you think about this renovation.\n\nWhen I started at the National Portrait Gallery 10 years ago, we didn't have that sentence. It's just a useful elevator pitch, especially to donors when you're saying you need to support this, and the reason is because X, the British Museum, we're actually coming at it from the other side because I think we've got the best of those sentences. That was done under Neil McGregor, my predecessor, this phrase about the British Museum being a museum of the world for the world. It's so good. It's infuriatingly good because it captures a lot and obviously no one sentence can encompass all the complexity of what we do and who we are and who we reach and the whole history and the good and the bad. But that goes quite far to sketching out the parameters.\n\nSo considering how much you like that sentence, will it need to change based on the renovation?\n\nI think Neil, even in that sentence, a museum of the world for the world was rightly very collection focused and I am too. One slight shift of emphasis is I'm probably also thinking about people quite a bit. The phrase that I keep coming back to is this phrase that Han Sloan used in his original will, which is all persons, that this is a museum which should benefit all persons and maybe all persons is slightly odd strap line for most people. 'cause it sounds quaint, but I keep coming back to that and I keep thinking, okay, what does that mean now in a digital age, in a global age, this was Hansel's original intention, which is that he wanted his collection to reach as many people as possible, that it should be free, that everyone should have access.\n\nIt should be for the benefit of everyone,\n\nBut that's all physical access. You have to come to London to see it or be in London to see it.\n\nYeah, because that's what was available at the time. But if he were living now, I'm sure he would be thinking about how to use digital technology, how to have international partnership. Three centuries ago he was visionary enough to invent something. Basically, we're the first public national museum in the world.\n\nIf I'm on your board, I might say that is a lovely notion Nick, and I love that you are trying to expand that notion into the present day when the virtual world has complimented the analog world so intensely. So why do we need to spend hundreds of millions of pounds on a renovation when in fact there's a way to make our collection and our ideas available to everyone all the time without them coming here? Because\n\nYou need both. It's not a binary choice or a zero sum game. As Mary Beard, one of my trustees said, we're in the business of knowledge transfer, which is true, but of course that's led by the collection that we hold hold, which is objects. Is the fact that more and more people want to come to visit the museum to see those objects in the flesh in person.\n\nI assume that you're just getting into the rather large fundraising process for your western range renovation. I'd love to hear your pitch, especially since this will rely on private donors. So let's say I'm a billionaire, maybe I'm even an expat oligarch who's now living in London. Why should I contribute to this new master plan of yours for the British Museum?\n\nI'd probably want to start by asking you this hypothetical billionaire, your experience with the museum. Most people I talk to visited the museum when they were young and it left a big mark on them and therefore what it did for you, and if you believe that it could do maybe the same thing or more for other people. Essentially the positive potential for this extraordinary collection, which I mean, let's be clear. It's arguably the greatest museum collection in the world. Complexity and controversy included. It is an incredible, incredible institution. The work it does, the research that it generates, the people it reaches, these are all inherently good things.\n\nAnd let's say I'm a little bit of an empiricist and I say that's all well and good nick, but what's the best evidence you can offer that cultural institutions help cause a society to thrive rather than cultural institutions being byproducts of a society that's already thriving and has enough money to spend on culture. In other words, what's your best evidence for the ROI on culture spending?\n\nThe honest answer would be just walking through the museum every day. I mean, even just going to the canteen to get my lunch. I was on the front desk last week. It's just seeing the people from all around the world that come into the museum, seeing the multi-generational visitors, including families, school groups especially. I mean, it's really amazing when you see 2030 school children from the UK or from abroad just having their horizons open. I don't need facts and figures. You walk around the museum and you see it happening every moment of the day.\n\nI am generally skeptical of people who say they don't need facts and figures. Still, I have been finding Nicholas Cullen's reasoning to be persuasive so far, or maybe it's just that his enthusiasm is contagious.

Toyota, let's Go places.\n\nWe're speaking today with Nicholas Cullinan, who became director of the British Museum in the summer of 2024. We first spoke in person at the museum in London, and then a few days later in a studio interview when I was back in New York. We'll pick up now with some conversation from that studio interview. This is the most cliched question ever, but I still find it a useful question when you go to a museum and you could take home one object and keep it, what's your keeper from the British Museum?\n\nIn my final interview for the role of director last year, one of the final questions was to talk about an object, and the object I talked about was the Portland vase, an amazing Roman glass cameo vase that we have with\n\nA great history. We should say, oh, with\n\nA great history. And that's also kind of why I chose it, because I'm a big fan of Susan Sontag's novel, the Volcano Lover, which is essentially a romantic novel around Lord Hamilton, who was the British ambassador Staples and the Portland vase makes quite a few important appearances in the book. Lord Hamilton sold it to the Dutchess of Portland and then her heirs put it on deposits at the British Museum and in I think it was 1845, a drunken visitor came in and smashed it into basically a thousand pieces for no reason, no reason whatsoever. It was then painstakingly put back together by restorers, which is extraordinary. And then a hundred years later, in 1945, just after the second World War, just as the world was putting itself back together and the British Museum too because it was bombed and you know there were whole galleries that had to be rebuilt.\n\nWe actually acquired, it was bought by the nation and since then also been restored a second time. I found it very moving that things survive all, first of all is kind of a miracle if you think about it. It's already been destroyed one time and it's managed to be pieced back together. It\n\nWas pieced back together because it was destroyed within the confines of a museum. Yeah,\n\nBut it could have been destroyed before that. It could never have been found. It could still be in the ground, it could be in a private collection and no one would know about it. Just the fact that things were museums at all is incredible when you actually think about it.\n\nWell, you're making a rather compelling argument, which comes at a different issue, which is the notion of repatriation. One of the primary arguments there is that museums, while they may be charged with possessing and showing materials that have been obtained in a variety of ways that are not so above board, where you use as looted, which no previous director of the British Museum that I'm aware of has ever used, and when people call for repatriation, one argument against that is that if these objects had not been kept in museums in the past and continue to be kept in museums, then they might disappear into either a private holding or who knows where. I wonder if you might wanna spend a little time talking about that at the moment as it pertains to works that the British Museum currently holds, whether it's Elgin marbles, whether it's Benin, bronzes, et cetera, how that factors into your general thinking about repatriation, and I realize that was a large side door we just walked through, but I know you can handle it.\n\nNo, it's really interesting. I'll begin by saying, as you might have gathered, I'm not really a big fan of ery thinking. You know, it only satisfies one party and that's not a way of sating about the past. Yes, as you said, some of the things that are in the collection, specifically the bed and bronzes, also the Ascente gold regalia, which is currently a loan back to the royal palace in Ghana. Those things were looted because we were at war with each other. I think most people now would delore that, but that's a historical fact that you can't get around. It's not about politics. We're just talking in a factual sense about what happened,\n\nAs logical as it sounds now when you explain it that way, why did previous directors of the British Museum not engage in that kind of language? They wouldn't use those words.\n\nI don't want to speak for my predecessors, and just to be clear, I'm not talking about the majority of the British Museum collection. I'm not even talking about a significant percentage. We have 13 live cases of claims for objects that are contested\n\nClaims, meaning requests from the\n\nRequests either for things to be repatriated or for dialogue or discussion. One of those is the Parton sculptures. We have 900 Ben and bronzes. That's one case I'm talking about, but 900 objects within that. The basic issue is there's an act of parliament from 1963 that expressly forbids the British Museum from deaccessioning its collection, and actually this goes back to your earlier question about maybe the differences between British and American museums. A lot of American museums, it's regular practice to deaccession from the collection. I'm not gonna name names because it's not really for me to talk about. Museums are not working, there's not a press release issued. It's often kept fairly quiet also, and I've seen it lots of small things where you've got better versions and so you quietly deaccession to small auction houses to not create a lot of press focus.\n\nSo it's pretty standard practice and there's an argument for being able to do that. I understand, which is to keep your collection manageable. In Britain, deaccessioning is basically forbidden. What that means is that often you end up with collections where they become very large, but there's a principle that these things have been acquired for the nation. They're owned by the people of Britain and therefore it's not the museum's right to sell them.\n\nOne thing that's always frustrated me about that argument, and we encountered this repeatedly when we did this series a couple years ago called Stealing art is Easy, giving it back is hard. I don't know if you agree with that sentiment or not.\n\nWell, you know what I would say sharing it is even easier. I\n\nLove that sentiment and I love that path that you're on with the British Museum, but the reason it's always been a frustrating argument to encounter is it just seemed like a ridiculous fig leaf to me. These are just laws passed by members of parliament. There's still a parliament which has the ability to pass new laws. I don't understand why that's clung to as if it's some natural physical\n\nLaw. I'm not, I'm not cling to it. It's important to state it because otherwise people might be under the misapprehension that it's our choice or it's our decision. Basically it would take an act of parliament. I don't wanna make trying to get an act of parliament past my sole focus. It would take years and you would also have a legal challenge from whom? Oh, well, from a member of the public that will decide this is not the right thing. If I decided tomorrow I wanted to do something radical\n\nLike send all your Benin bronzes back to somewhere. Although that's complicated too.\n\nI'll be taken to court for sure. I mean there's no question. So people need to factor that into the process too, and that's not me using that as an excuse. There isn't a legal framework for us to just do this in a straightforward way.",

      "transcript_chunk": "out, go out and read diversion of nuclear material IAEA reports dating back at least 20 years and you'll see the IA meticulously, methodically dispassionately outlining all of the violations that Iran has embarked on of the NPT. Virtually\n\nAll those are resolved later. They won't answer this, and then later they do, they won't answer that. And then later they do.\n\nAnd many open files are still a still there. I mean, just again, like I just, I just want your viewers to walk away from this conversation thing. Okay. That's interesting. I I I didn't know that and that I'm gonna go fact check mark and fact check Scott and just kind of see what this is all about, right? Because otherwise it's just he says, she says, or he says, he says, the fact of the matter is, is that Iran has been in violations of its obligations under the NPT under the additional protocol. It never, it never, it never ratified under its safeguards, obligations under the NPT. It suggests a pattern of nuclear mendacity. They\n\nAbided by the additional protocol without having ratified it. They abide by it for three years and did not proceed with any enrichment at all as long as they were dealing in good faith with the EU until W Bush ruined those negotiations and closed them down, only then did they begin to install the centrifuges at Naans. It's\n\nAlways the Americans you complained screw things up, you\n\nComplained. They didn't ratify the thing, but they abided by it for years. So,\n\nSo that's an interesting\n\nDisagreement. They were violation of it. But\n\nI, I think a more pragmatic and important disagreement that we already spoke to is how do we decrease the incentive for Iran to build nuclear programs, not just the next couple years, but the next 10, 20 years that's you're mocking that. There's a lot of people that will, there's neocons that say basically invade everything, let's make money off of war. But there's people that will say that, you know, Operation Midnight Hammer is actually a focused hard demonstration of strength, a piece of strength that is an effective way to do geopolitics. I mean, there's cases to be made for all of it if\n\nWe're really lucky.\n\nYeah. So it's a big risk is your case. So\n\nHere's some practical recommendations that I think the United States should follow. I think the first is, you know, get the Iranians back to Oman, negotiate with them and do a deal. Again, the deal has to be no enrichment full dismantlement. I I, I think for the reasons we talked about today, Scott and I passionately disagreed. But that's fine. We, this is, this is a reasonable debate. Neither of us is crazy, neither of us is rational. It is, what would it take to get a deal with Iran? I say, I say this is the deal. This has to be our red line. Scott disagrees, that's fine, but we gotta get a deal in that deal. We gotta provide them financial incentives, right? We're gonna have to lift a certain number of sanctions because they, they're gonna have to get something in return, right? We can argue about exactly how much, but I think our opening negotiating position is no sanctions relief.\n\nAnd then we'll get negotiated down from that, right? I mean, like, I think a lot of this is about how do you position yourself for a negotiation? How do you, how do you come in with leverage and then how do you find areas of compromise where you, you satisfy your objectives? One is Oman, two is the credible threat of military force needs to remain, right? Hamnet needs to understand that the United States of America and Israel will use military force to stop him from developing Nuclear Weapons if he didn't believe that before 12 days ago. He now believes that. And I think that's the credibility of that military force has to be maintained in order to ensure that he does not break out or sneak out to a Nuclear weapons.\n\nI, I think that's absolutely critical. Third is, I think we have to reach agreements with all the other countries in the Middle East to say, Hey listen, we're demanding zero enrichment and full dismantlement from the Iranians. You don't get enrichment and you don't get a nuclear program that is capable of developing Nuclear Weapons. Our gold standard is the American standard civilian nuclear energy, like 23 countries, no enrichment and ROCs. We should be consistent. We should be consistent not just with American allies, but also very clear with American enemies. I think that's the third important thing we do. Fourth is I think we, it's really important that we find some kind of accommodation between the Israelis and the Palestinians. We can go down many rabbit holes on that, but I think that lays the predicate for a Saudi Israeli normalization deal that then brings in multiple Arab countries and Muslim countries.\n\nAnd finally is, we talked about the Abraham Accords. I, I think we need to start thinking about what did the Cyrus Accords look like, right? Cyrus was the great Persian king, right? Who by the way brought the, you know, the Jews back from, from the diaspora to Jerusalem and Cyrus Accords would be, let's find an agreement between the United States and Israel and Iran, right? That would be a remarkable transformation in the region if we could actually do that. So imagine the Middle East, and again, I know this sounds fanciful, but I think this is what Trump has in mind when he starts to talk about the things you're seeing in these truth posts is actually the Middle East that can be fundamentally transformed where we actually do bring peace between Israel, Iran, Saudi Arabia, and the rest of these countries.\n\nI by the way, completely agree with you on Syria, the idea that we are trusting a former Al-Qaeda ISIS jihadist to rule Syria, I think is a big bet President Trump has made, he's made it on the advice of MBS. We'll see how that transforms or transpires and see if Syria has transformed. But the notion that somehow we should just be rolling the dice, lifting all the sanctions and taking this former Al-Qaeda jihadist at his word is a big bet if we get the bet right? That is actually a remarkable occurrence because now all of a sudden Syria and Lebanon are brought into this Abraham Accords, Cyrus Accords structure.\n\nAnd then we actually have, what I think all three of us want is peace in the Middle East, stability in the Middle East. I don't think we need democracy in the Middle East. I think if the Middle East looked like the UAE, that'd be a pretty good Middle East. I think we'd all be pretty comfortable with that if that kind of stability and prosperity. And ultimately you could put these countries on a pathway to greater democracy the way that we did during the Cold War where countries like Taiwan and South Korea that were military dictatorships ended up becoming pro-Western democracy. So that's kind of stepping back maybe a little bit Pollyannish, but I think we should also always keep in mind what a potential vision for peace could look like.\n\nSo Scott, as many people know here in Austin, Texas, you're the director of The Libertarian Institute. Let's zoom out a bit. What are the key pillars of Libertarianism and how that informs how you see the world?\n\nWell, very basis of Libertarianism is the non-aggression principle, but which essentially is the same thing as our, our social rules for dealing with each other in private life. No force, no theft, no fraud, and keep your hands to yourself. And we apply that same moral law to government. And so, you know, some libertarians are in our non-capitalist, some are so-called monarchists, meaning we want the absolute minimum amount of government a night watchman type state in, in other words, just enough to enforce contracts and protect property rights and allow freedom and a free market to work. There's also, of course a natural rights theory, Austrian school economics and a lot of revisionist history.\n\nAnd, and it, something very key to libertarian theory was, is expressed by Marianne Rothbard was that war is the key to the whole libertarian business because especially in the United States of America, as long as we maintain a world empire makes it impossible for us to have a limited and decentralized government here at home as our constitution describes. And so it's gonna crack a joke, but neither of you have called me an isolationist yet. But I was gonna joke, yes, as, as Thomas Jefferson wrote in the Declaration of Isolation, the, the same guy, a principal author of the Declaration of Isolation, he said in his first inaugural address, we seek peace, commerce and honest friendship with all nations and entangling alliances with none.\n\nAnd that's the true libertarian philosophy. Thank Dr Ron Paul, the great congressman for many years up there, he was supposed to all sanctions, all economic war on the rest of the world and the entire state of the United States as world empire. And what's strange now is that anyone who wants just peace as the standard is considered an isolationist. And people who are for world empire and a permanent state of conflict with the rest of the world, economic war coups and regime changes and even invasions, those are considered normal people. It's almost like people who want peace should be called cis foreign policy. 'cause now we gotta, we have to come up with a funny word to describe a normal state of being when no one calls Mexico an isolationist state.\n\nJust 'cause they mind their own business. And is there any faction anywhere in America that calls themself isolationist? Even the paleo conservatives who favor much more like trade protectionism and that kind of thing than libertarians. They don't call themselves isolationists, they still want to have an open relationship with the world to some degree when isolation means like the hermit kingdom of North Korea or some crazy thing like that. No one wants that for the United States of America. What we want is independence, non interventionism and peace.\n\nSo to you, isolationism is a kind of dirty word\n\nTo describe that's a smear term. It's a mir term invented by interventionists and internationalists to attack anyone who didn't want to go along with their agenda. The term itself is used essentially as a smear against anyone who doesn't want to Go to war.\n\nSo can you actually just deeper describe what non interventionism means? So how much sort of display of military strength should be there, do you think?\n\nDr. Paul said we could defend this country with a couple of good submarines, which by the way, for people who don't know, one American trident sub could essentially kill every city and military base in Russia, just one. So he's absolutely right about that. A couple of good submarines are enough to defend our coasts and deter anyone from messing with the United States of America. And then I admit, I'm a little bit idealistic about this, that I think of that old William Jennings, Bryan Speech Beholder Republic, where unlike the empires of Europe burdened under the weight of militarism, here we have a free country and where you know what we could do?\n\nWe could be the host of peace conferences everywhere. There are frozen conflicts in the conflicts in the donbas, in Leningrad, in Transtria, in Taiwan, in Korea, virtually all the borders of Africa and Eurasia were drawn by European powers to either divide and conquer their enemies or artificially group their enemies together in order to keep them internally divided and conquered in those ways. So there are great many borders in the world that are in contention and that people might even want to fight about. And I think that America could play a wonderful role in helping to negotiate and resolve those types of conflicts without resorting to force or, or even making any promises on the part of the US government.\n\nLike we'll pay Egypt to pretend to be nice to Israel or anything like that, but just find ways to host conferences and, and find resolutions to these problems. And I think quite sincerely that Donald Trump right now could get on a plane to Tehran. He could then Go to Moscow, to Beijing and Pyongyang and he could come home and be Trump the great, we in fact don't have to have the, especially the American hyper power as the French called it, the world empire. We have everything to give and nothing to lose to go ahead. And Donald Trump even talked like this. You might remember when he first was sworn in this time, he said, you know what, instead of pivoting from terrorism to great power competition with Russia and China, I don't wanna do that.\n\nI just want to get along with both of them. Let's just move on and have the rest of the century be peace and prosperity and not fighting at all. Why should we have to pivot to China? Let's just pivot to capitalism and trade and freedom. And peace. That's America first. Yeah, I,\n\nI've of criticize Trump a lot, but I think maybe he's just rhetoric, but I think he talks about peace a lot. Even just recently, the, the number of times the word peace is mentioned and with seriousness, not you get like a genuine desire for peace from him. And that's just beautiful to see for the leader of, of this country. And\n\nLook man, there used to be a time when a third of the planet was dominated by the communists, right? So like I'm not gonna sit here and argue the first cold war with you. My book's about the second one and I'm not as good on the first. But since the end of the first Cold War, we have let the neoconservative policy of the defense planning guidance of 92 and rebuilding America's defenses and the rest of this American dominance centered policy control our entire direction in the world. It's led to the war on terrorism in the Middle East, seven countries we've attacked. It's led to the disaster in Eastern Europe and its leading toward disaster in Eastern Asia when there's just no reason in the world that it has to be this way with the comms dead and gone.\n\nAnd again, I to stipulate here, the Chinese flag is still red, it's still a one party dictatorship, but they have abandoned Marxism. I mean people were starving to death by the tens of millions there. It's a huge, it's probably the greatest improvement in the condition of mankind anywhere ever in the shortest amount of time when Deng Xiaoping in the right wing of the communist party took over in that country. Just\n\nOne more thing, you mentioned the two submarines. What's the role of Nuclear Weapons?\n\nWell, I would like for America to have an extremely minimal nuclear deterrent and work toward a world free of Nuclear Weapons. And I know that that sounds utopian. However, I would remind your audience that Ronald Reagan and Mikal Gorbachev came within a hair of achieving a deal just like that at Kovic Iceland in 1986. And they were both of them dead serious about it, complete and total nuclear disarmament. And then Reagan was essentially bullied by Richard Pearl and others on his staff saying, you promised the American people that you would build them a defensive anti missile system, the Star Wars system, which was total pie in the sky technological fantasy of the 1980s.\n\nAnd if you're getting rid of all the ICBMs, then why the hell do you a need a missile shield anyway? Is the world's probably greatest tragedy that ever took place that Ronald Reagan walked away from those negotiations. They literally were within a hair and it wasn't magic and there was no trust in evil, bad guys. This is, by the way, two years before the wall came down, this is when everybody still thought the USSR was gonna last. And Reagan had the plan was that America and the Soviet Union would dismantle our Nuclear Weapons until we were right around with parody with the other Nuclear Weapons states who all have right around two or 300 nukes France, Britain at that time, Israel and China, Indian Pakistan came later.\n\nSouth Africa only had a few of them, but gave up whatever they had. And the idea was we would get down to two or 300 and then America and the Soviet Union both together would lean hard on Britain, France, and China.",

      "transcript_chunk": "hat's certainly is true is that it makes us more susceptible by us. I'll say the United States and broadly the West, more susceptible and subject to very inhospitable regimes where we have to turn to fill in what we no longer can produce ourselves. When we think about the massive US involvement in the Middle East, that remains a constant ongoing source of political difficulty in our country down to what's happening in our campuses.\n\nI would say that's evidence of, maybe the word peak oil is something we don't want to use, but of hard oil. Difficult oil, so I'll stick with some aspects of that, but the maga Doge, again, people can mock me if they want for saying this. What hasn't lasted is the odd relationship between Trump and Musk. In fact, between friends, I said, those guys aren't gonna get along that long. They're two massive egos that's not gonna last. What has lasted is the desire to combine two things that don't go easily together, and that's really what that article was about. Maga, which is an economic set of policies and commitments that are not libertarian, they're not classical liberal tariffs and limiting immigration, deporting illegal immigrants picking winners and losers as classical liberals would say, in economics, attempting to support certain kinds of industries.\n\nThat's maga, at least in the economic domain. Doge is cutting government, decreasing inefficiencies, going after wasteful spending, and if you look at the one big beautiful bill that was kind of MAGA doge, it's kind of combination of both of those things. While you still have the MAGA economic policies rolling out, you also still have the desire to reduce regulation and reduce taxation. So these two things are combined, and I say this because what does the Republican coalition look like after Trump? It's going to be probably in the person of JD Vance, and that article was really saying, JD is that effort to keep those two things together, so I'll stick with that as well.\n\nLet me just address though what you just said about the accomplishments or the aims of the big beautiful bill while trying to accomplish the goals that you just stated. There's also a massive increase to the federal debt and federal deficit, which I can't find anyone in any government over the past 50 years who thinks that's a great idea, and there's also, I don't wanna call it an abandonment, but a great diminishment in funding for the care and coverage of the most vulnerable people in our society. When I look at the Trump administration and President Trump himself, it's an administration whose leader is demonstrably enthusiastic about acquiring wealth and power for himself and his allies, while at the same time reducing help for what we used to call the needy.\n\nYou're a serious Catholic teaching at a Catholic university. The appetite for wealth and power is not very Jesus like, nor is turning a blind eye on the needing.\n\nI'm not advancing Donald Trump as a moral exemplar by any stretch.\n\nI'm not asking for moral. I could care less about moral at the moment, but I don't understand why the menu of items that the Trump administration has been pursuing is so widely embraced by all the Republicans, all the conservatives, when prima fascia, some of them go against everything that they've stood for. I understand that there's a pursuit of a larger good, but it's hard for me to understand why those particulars are embraced when they seem to have such evidence against their virtue and value.\n\nI'm a little bit uncertain whether you're asking me what I personally think as a Catholic about these phenomena or put on my political theorist hat as you asked me to do, how I would explain these. I'll\n\nTake either,\n\nI think I try to offer some explanation for why we see not just this administration, but so many administrations increasing the debt and what would be necessary to begin to genuinely try to pay that down. We would have to really, as a society, develop the capacity to think generationally a liberal order based on what I think of as this notional idea of the social contract tends to be very, presentist, tends to be about satisfying ourselves in a more immediate way and not thinking not only in terms of solidarity with others who we happen to live with and near, but thinking in solidarity intergenerationally.\n\nWithout that, I don't see any prospect of really reducing the debt on the question of how I think it's at all possible that, as far as I understand them, the Medicare provisions of that bill, how they could possibly have been supported by Trump and the MAGA world Here. I think you probably have longstanding Republican slash classical liberal desire to reform entitlements, and this was one mechanism by which you could satisfy that or scratch that particular itch. Do I think this was personally well done and desirable? No, I do not. Maybe nobody's gonna touch social security, but you know, increasing the age and increasing the level at which you tax for social security would be a sensible way to go forward without destroying, I think that necessary institution, probably we share agreement that we need entitlement reform that doesn't destroy those institutions, but I do think there were at least enough members of the House of Representatives and Senate that wanted that itch to be scratched.\n\nGoing back to some of your policy endorsements in your book regime Change, one of them was to enforce public morality, ban porn and denounce transgressive media. What does that mean? Am I transgressive media? Who defines that?\n\nMaybe this will be controversial. Probably is, but the more dyne understanding is that there used to be something called, I think, family Hour on television. It wasn't banning transgression per se, but it was recognizing that there are certain hours of the day when in the interest of paying deference, especially to families, maybe of more traditional worldview, one's job as the members of the media was not to promote transgressive worldview to young children. That was specifically the kind of thing I was thinking about, the willingness to, in this case, publicly funded at some level, or people are using public airwaves to say, you have a responsibility to understand that you play an educative role in our society.\n\nYou influence the worldview of people and in deference to those who don't want to expose their children to these transgressive ideas as a public matter, a matter of public commitment, this is something we as a society should prioritize now, does that solve it? Does that solve the problem that kids can get on the internet? And there's a lot worse stuff on there than you can see on Yeah, no, it doesn't solve that.\n\nYeah. This is a genie out of the bottle problem, and let me just ask you to cast your mind back to maybe it's 1500 years or 2200 years. I know your mind can go back there. We didn't even get to talk about really your favorite dark horse political philosopher. That's Jama Vico, is that his name?\n\nVico? That's right, yeah.\n\nSorry, we're running outta time. We didn't get to Vico.\n\nThat's okay. I\n\nAm curious how previous thinkers have dealt with the genie outta the bottle problem that you're describing right now.\n\nEvery society advances a set of views. I think we tend to operate in the view that, well, we ideally operate in a neutral system, right? This is the liberal conceit, a neutral system that doesn't put a finger on the scale and any particular direction, but the finger on the scale is there, and the finger on the scale is on one that I could say broadly seeks to dissolve, take down, whether by intent or simply force of societal norms to disassemble the guardrails that most societies understand is necessary to form and shape a responsible human life. That argument, the suggestion that, okay, let's, as a matter of public record say, here's something that we value.\n\nWe value a public educative aspect of our society. We value advancing views of human flourishing that include the idea of sound families, that include the idea that marriage is a positive good, which social studies will tell you this is the case, getting married, staying married, having children. That commitment to local communities is a positive good, as opposed to simply being a part of this more deracinated, globalized economic system. And that suggestion, that argument was, it would be a beneficial and desirable aspect of shifting from this substantive libertarian worldview to one in which we supported certain set of positive, visible goods.\n\nDoes it solve the problems? Of course not, but I do think those public stances very often in very subtle ways help to shape how we perceive the world.\n\nWhen my kids were young and they would encounter something in school that was overboard in terms of, you know, all the things that you get in an enlightened New York City school. I came up with a phrase, I'm sure many people have said some version of it before, but I said to them, you know, I think that almost every correction is an overcorrection. The problem is when the correction is made, and it is an overcorrection, the opponents will try to invalidate the reason for the correction in the first place, which is legitimate.\n\nThis is one of my major concerns about aspects of the current Trump approach to correcting many of the elite institutions where those institutions now stand is a kind of overcorrection coming out of the late sixties and you know, a whole host of desires to kind of overturn an older, maybe more traditional way of life, and the Trump moment has, you know, there's real danger that it could also be an overcorrection. I'm not the ideological guru necessarily, but to the extent that I do have some ears in that world, it's to call for and to underscore that there needs to be articulated a positive vision.\n\nWhat is good journalism? What is a good university? What is a flourishing social and political order? There's a real danger that the desire to correct the correction ends up simply being one that disassembles and destroys. I'm the last person you would encounter that wants to see, for example, the university simply dismantled it needs correction, and I'm sad to say that it had ample opportunity to self-correct and didn't take it in more hopeful moments. I'm beginning to see some evidence that that's happening under the threat of political pressure. There's a kind of awareness that, well, yeah, we really do need to correct what we've done.\n\nThat's the hopeful mornings, and then the more fearful mornings are the ones where I think of it's all gonna go wrong.\n\nIn the few weeks since I had this conversation with Patrick Deneen, I have found myself thinking hard about it. I suspect you will too. There are a lot of interesting ways to interpret Deneen because A, he's an interesting thinker himself, and B, he has got a particularly fluid way of connecting thinkers from antiquity to the here and now. But the conversation also left me with more questions. When you want to shift a social or political system back toward its traditional roots, who gets to decide which elements of progress have been hurtful and which have been helpful? Which parts of the correction are overcorrection and which are sensible?\n\nAnd for whom many millions of people around the world have purposely moved away from traditions that they felt held them back or punished them? Do Aristotle and Viko and Patrick Deneen speak for them, defend and protect them? It's not clear, at least not to me. Another way to interpret Deneen after this conversation is as a sign to the Democratic party. Here's what I mean by that. When you lose the allegiance of a thinker like Deneen, you've really lost something. He was a Democratic lifer. He got his PhD under an ardent New Deal, Democrat, as he put it, and he spent time in the Clinton administration.\n\nSo if you, dear listener, are a Democrat, you may find yourself wishing he had stayed in your camp because he could be really useful right about now. And if you are a Republican, you may find yourself hoping that Deneen will be the ideological guru that the Wall Street Journal was describing, because a Republican party under the influence of someone like Patrick Deneen would certainly be a more deliberative and conventional party than the one it's become. Let us know what you think. Whatever side of whichever aisle you happen to live on, our email is radio@freakonomics.com. My thanks to Patrick Deneen for the conversation.\n\nThanks also to Cass Sunstein, Eugene McCarr, mark Dunkelman, Robert Putnam, and the editors of Common Wheel Magazine for research help. Coming up next time on the show, whenever air traffic controllers are making headlines, that is probably not a good thing.\n\nThe system will not last forever, every day that goes by, we're getting one day closer to when the thing will break.\n\nWe basically have a iPhone five when the rest of the world has an iPhone 18.\n\nIt's so obvious what the answer here is. It was obvious in 1995,\n\nObvious, maybe doable. That's a different story. We take a hard look at a hard problem, air traffic control, and the Federal Aviation Administration.

      "transcript_chunk": "hat war and for American help in prosecuting it. And he said yes. Okay. And then help them\n\nDo it. I'm gonna segue into an answer. 'cause I Sure. I think it deserves an answer. A military industrial complex is a serious concern because I think you're right. It there, you know, the bigger it gets and the more weapons you have, you think the more, the greater the temptation to use it, right? I think that's sort of the, yes. The argument. And then there's also self-enrichment and how much money can be made. And, and all of that I think is of serious concern to people. Look, I think Trump is somebody who, it's hard pressed to say that Donald Trump is a great advocate of the military industrial complex, or that he is, he is in their pocket the same way that he's in the pocket of the Israelis and in the pocket of the Saudis and in the pocket of everybody.\n\nI mean, I think the one thing with Trump is that Trump has, he has learned the lessons of American engagement over the past few decades. And I think Scott's done a good job of kind of laying out the mistakes that have been made, even though, you know, we can discuss about causal connections and who's responsible. And you know, I I lean on\n\nWhen we, I want to, well,\n\nScott, can I finish? Because, you know, your, your causal connection is always, it's America Aggressing, Israel Aggressing, and all these poor people responding to us. But nonetheless, I think Trump has, he's learned the lessons, but he hasn't overlooked the lessons. He, he's not paralyzed by Iraq or Afghanistan, or the mistakes made by his predecessors. He understands that at the end of the day, we need serious American power. We need lethal power. We need four deterrents. And he's been very careful and very selective about how he uses American power. I mean, we've talked about it throughout this whole conversation. Trump used American power to kill Qsm Soleimani, the one of the world's most dangerous terrorists. He killed Baghdadi the head of isis, one of the world's most dangerous terrorists.\n\nHe, he refrained from going after the Iranian take down of our drone. He refrained from when the Iranians fired on Saudi Aramco and took off 20% of our oil. Right. He's been very, very selective about the use of American power. He did go after the Houthis who are Iran backed, and we're using Iranian missiles to go after our shifts.\n\nThat's not true. Those are North Korean missiles completely debunked by Jane's Defense Weekly. Nice\n\nTry. Yeah, nice try. Anyway, everybody knows that the Iranians have been financing the Houthis 'cause Bah has been training the Houthis, and Iran has given capabilities to the Houthis to develop their own indigenous missile capability. The fact of the matter is, he, he did in a way go after the Houthis much more intensively than Biden did, in order to prevent them from continuing to shut down Red Sea shipping on which both America and our allies depend as a trade route. He actually did it quite successfully because after a few days of pretty intensive bombing, the Houthis got the message and they cut a deal with Donald Trump. They're not gonna interfere with our ship anymore. He\n\nCut a deal with them, they kept bombing Israel, which is what got him involved in the first place. He completely backed out. Sounds to me like they won, and he backed\n\nDown. Well, it sounds, it sounds like he, in terms of promoting American national security interests, it sounds like he did, he did a pretty good job of sending a message to the Houthis and the Iranians don't wear masks with the United States. And that gets us to the contemporary reality. He took a decision one day on one day to send our B twos and our subs in order to, to severe damage to three nuclear facilities. It was a one day campaign. It was selective. It was narrow, it was overwhelming. And I think it sends a message to Kane, I think it sends a message to regimes around the world, anti-American regimes around the world, that Donald Trump has not overlearned the lessons of the past 20 years.\n\nRight. But that in fact, he is not going to dismantle the US military and dismantle our nuclear program and fly around to all these cities and call peace conferences and hope that these dictators will just sit down with America and say, you know what? All is forgiven the United States of America. It's all your fault. You did this all. We, we admit our responsibility. And then we have, we have peace and paradise on earth. I think Trump is much more pragmatic and in some respects, cynical. When he looks at the world and he realizes the world is a dangerous place. I have to be very careful about how I use American military forces.\n\nI am not gonna send hundreds of thousands of people around the world, by the way, I mean, we all talk about Israel. I mean, the Israelis are one of the best allies we could possibly have. They fight and they die in their own defense. They fought multiple wars against American enemies. They haven't asked for American troops on the ground. There are no boots on the ground in Israel defending Israel. The, the best we've given them is we've given them a fad system to help them shoot down ballistic missiles that have aimed at, aimed at them. And our American pilots have been in the air recently with our Israeli friends shooting down ballistic missiles. But the Israelis have had a, a, a warrior ethos. We will fight and we will die in our own defense. I would just say, if you're gonna actually build out a model where you're gonna minimize the risk to American troops, let's find more allies like that.\n\nRight? I worry about, I'm like, Scott, I really worry about China, Taiwan. I really, really worry about that because the Taiwanese are not capable of defending themselves without US assistance. And the, and we may have to send American men and women to go defend Taiwan, and we can have a whole debate about the wisdom of that. But again, it, it would be very, very helpful to have more Israels in the world, more countries that are capable of fighting against common enemies and against common threats without having to always put American boots on the ground in order to do that.\n\nSo you made a case for if, if it's okay, if you, you made a case for strength here. Just practically speaking, why do you think Trump has talked about peace a lot? Why do you think he hasn't been able to get to a ceasefire with Ukraine and Russia, for example, if we just move away from Iran? Yeah. Without getting into the history of the whole thing. Like why he's been talking peace, peace, peace, peace, peace. He's been pushing it and pushing it. What can we learn about that so far? Failure, that's also instructive for Iran.\n\nLook, I'm not a Russia expert. I'm not a Ukraine expert. I'm sitting in front of two people who know a lot more about that conflict than I do. I, I I you are,\n\nWe should say banned by Putin.\n\nI am, I have been sanctioned by Russia and by Iran. Yeah, I\n\nSanctioned.\n\nYes. Yes. Banned, sanctioned, threatened.\n\nCongratulations.\n\nThank you. Thank you. Well, it's, it calls us some difficulties. But anyway, I think the answer to that is that for Putin, he needs to understand that, like Kane, he has two options here, right? Option one, which President Trump has signaled over and over and over again is come sit down and negotiate a ceasefire with the Ukrainians. I don't wanna get into the details on the back and forth about who's responsible for the fact that there's no ceasefire Putin or Zelensky. I mean, that's a whole other debate and I'm sure you guys have a lot of opinions on that. But path one is sit down and let's negotiate a ceasefire path. Two is the United States will use American power in order to build our leverage so that Vladimir Putin understands that he has to do a ceasefire.\n\nNow, I'm not suggesting US troops absolutely not, right? What I'm suggesting is there's a package right now of sanctions that have 88 co-sponsors in the Senate across party lines. And I think Trump is using that and will use that as a sort of sort of dam. He's hanging over Putin and the Russian economy to say, look, if Vladimir, we either do a ceasefire or I'm gonna have no choice but to have to start imposing much more punishing sanctions on you and on the Russian economy. So I think there's an economic option. I think there's a military option. And I think the biggest mistake Biden made in this whole war, and there's many mistakes in terms of signaling not having us credibility, you know, Afghan debacle, which signaled to Putin that he could invade without any kind of American response is he kind of went in and he tied Ukraine's hands behind their back.\n\nI mean, he actually tied one hand behind their back while they were fighting with the other hand. And he refused to give him the kinds of systems that early on in the war would've allowed the Ukrainian military to be able to hit Russian forces that were mobilizing on the Russian Ukrainian border. And I think if he had done that, I think this war would've ended sooner. There'd be far more, less casualties. And I think Putin would then understand maybe I need to strike a deal. I'm not a Russia expert or Ukraine expert. I don't know what the deal looks like. You keep the Don Bass, you keep Crimea, you keep, you know, larger chunks of Eastern Ukraine. That's for smarter people than me on this issue to decide what the deal looks like. But there's no doubt today Putin thinks that he can just keep fighting, keep killing Ukrainians, keep driving forward.\n\nEventually he's gonna wear down the Ukrainians through a sheer war of attrition. He'll throw hundreds of thousands of Russians at this. He doesn't care how many Russians are gonna die. That's the way that Russians and the Soviets have fought wars for many, many years. Just endless number of Russian bodies being thrown into the Meek Rider. And he thinks he can continue without any consequences. And I worry that as a result of the fact that we are not showing Putin, that we've got leverage, it's made war more likely, it's made a a, a war more brutal. And it's gonna make a war more pro active.\n\nBut increasing military aid to Ukraine in the case that you described, also has to be coupled with extreme pressure to make peace. Correct.\n\nExtreme pressure to make peace, which\n\nTrump hopefully is, appears to be doing now in Iran,\n\nI think Trump is early. I mean, it's interesting you said that 'cause he's early indicators, again, who knows where the ceasefire goes. But I think it was important, it was, he, he slapped Kane, but he also said to bb Enough, enough. And it's like, okay, now we're going back to Oman. There's gonna be a temporary ceasefire. Now let's negotiate. And I think that's important. And I think it shows that Donald Trump is leading, not following. It shows that Donald Trump is his own man, not on the payroll of the Russians or the Iranians or the Israelis or these other crazy accusations that have been made about this guy for many, many years. And he's gonna give, you know, as they say, peace of chance.\n\nAnd he's going to give, give a ceasefire a chance. He's gonna give negotiations a chance. But I'll think he's sending the message to the Iranians and he needs to send it to Putin is if you don't take me up on my offer. Right. I've already demonstrated it that I am serious and I will use American power carefully and selectively in the way that I've done in the past\n\nAt the risk of doing the thing I shouldn't do. But just to test the ideas of Libertarianism and the things we've been talking about. Can we, for a brief time, unrelated to everything we've been talking about, talk about World War ii, what was the right thing to do in 19 38, 19 39? Like what would you do? Okay, to be clear, world War II has nothing to do with current events. In fact, many of the horrible policies of the United States, in my opinion, have to have to do with projecting World War II onto every single conflict in the world. Okay, agree. But\n\nOverlearning over\n\nOverlearning. But it is an interesting extreme case. Just to clarify, I'm just like philosophically talking about, yeah. At which point do you hit, do you do military intervention? And that's a nice case. Maybe you have a better case study, but that's such an extreme one. Yeah. That it's interesting. We're\n\nTalking about Germany or Japan,\n\nGermany side. Yeah. So, so Japan\n\nAttacked us and Germany declared war on us. Tough for them. And that's what happens when you declare war on the United States, you get hit.\n\nBut that was an idiotic on the part of Hitler to declare war in the United States. You\n\nKnow, I never understood why he ever did that. They always said it was just 'cause he was crazy. But what it was is he was trying to get the Japanese to invade the Soviet Union from the East and in order to divide Stalin's forces, which failed and it didn't work. And it was a huge blunder from his point of view. I guess\n\nPhilosophically, from an interventionism perspective, you're saying United States should have stayed out from that war as long as possible until they're attacked. Yes.\n\nI mean, and look at how powerful they ended up being and the amount of damage that they were able to inflict on the Soviets, better them than us.\n\nWhat do you think? Look, I I, is this a useful discussion?\n\nIt's interesting. I mean, I think it's interesting of sort of philosophically, you know, Libertarianism or, or isolationism in practice. I mean, I think the thirties are more interesting to me than what happened between 39 and 45. I think the debate in America was very interesting in the thirties where there was really a strong isolationist movement, you know, with ch Charles Lindbergh and, and Henry Ford and Father Cochlan and many,\n\nAnd Joe Kennedy.\n\nYeah. And Joe Kennedy. I mean, they defined themselves as sort of America Firsters, but it was very much an isolationist strain. And I, I think, you know, we can talk about that history. And\n\nKauflin was a new dealer, not a right winger\n\nAnyway, very much an isolationist talking about America having to stay out these entangling alliances. This is not our war. Emotionally understandable. Right. Because you can, you can also overlearn the lessons of World War I. Right. And I think they overlearned the lessons of World War I, I mean, which was a brutal war and a devastating war mostly for Europe, but obviously for the United States. We, we lost thousands of American men and women. So the thirties was this big debate between the, those who saw the gathering storm of what was happening with Nazi Germany and those who wanted to keep America out. And I think in some respects, it's like today with a contemporary reality with Kameni, is that because these isolationist voices were so prominent and so vocal, and in some cases quite persuasive to American leaders, Hitler calculated that the United States would not enter the war.\n\nAnd so he could do what Scott says, he could focus on the eastern front, he could gather his forces, and then he could do a kill shot on the Western Democracies in Western Europe. And the United States would not intervene. I mean, you're right, the, the big mistake he makes is declaring war in the United States after Pearl Harbor. But he believes all through the thirties and before Pearl Harbor, that the isolationist voices are keeping fdd r from entering the war, even while Churchill and the Brits and the French and others are imploring the Americans, not only to just, just to provide, provide them with material support with weapons so that they could hold, hold onto the island and and defend themselves.\n\nAnd I think Hitler Miscalculates in the same way, I think Kne Miscalculates Kne heard the debate over the past number of years. He believed that this sort of isolationist wing of the Republican party, right, represented, I think in, you know, by Tucker Carlson and others who have been very anti intervention with respect to Iran.",

      "transcript_chunk": "s were killed, led by Norway, Japan, the Soviet Union, and Britain. But plainly, that couldn't continue. And this is what led in 1946 to the establishment of the International Whaling Commission. 15 of the biggest whaling countries got together to regulate how many whales could be killed\n\nIn the beginning. The I WC is for the orderly development of the whaling industry. So it's a very pro whaling pro industry organization where group of nations get together and try to figure out how to preserve this resource.\n\nThe IWC today is an anti whaling organization. It advocates for a total ban on commercial whaling, but back then it was trying to reach a happy medium. The problem was they didn't have any real power to tell a given country how many whales they could kill. Instead, the IWC set a global quota, and this had an unintended and perverse consequence.\n\nThey called it the Whaling Olympics. It caused these fleets to go out and catch as many big whales as they could, as fast as possible.\n\nThe 1960s turned out to be the peak of global wailing. Some species were by now close to extinction, including the right whale, the humpback, and the blue whale. But then things began to change for the whales. If you were around way back in 1970, you might remember a record album called Songs of the Humpback Whale. It was a pretty big hit.\n\nI remember that National Geographic included a disc 45 inside one of their additions so that people could listen to humpback whale songs.\n\nThat is Kate O'Connell. She's a policy advisor with the Animal Welfare Institute, that's one of the oldest conservation groups in the us.\n\nThey were actually singing songs, and I think they've captivated the imagination of people around the world.\n\nO'Connell says, the album also shifted the public's thinking toward whales by showing the complexities of their behavior. The rise of this pro whale sentiment fit in nicely with the rise of the conservation movement generally. This was an era when the value of clean air and clean water was becoming more visible and more important. There was also the sense that preserving whales rather than hunting them, just made sense. Given how the global economy had evolved, humankind had found cheaper and easier sources for fuel and food. So why don't we just celebrate the whale as a beautiful free animal?\n\nIn 1970, the folk singer Judy Collins recorded a traditional whale hunting song with backing vocals by the humpbacks.\n\nWe're bound a green land and ready to sail in hopes to find riches in hunting the way.\n\nSoon after the US banned commercial wailing under the Marine Mammal Protection Act and the new environmental group, Greenpeace made its mark by launching a movement called Save the Whales.\n\nIt always has been my lifelong ambition to eradicate whaling from the planet.\n\nThat is Paul Watson, a self-described eco warrior. We met him in the first episode of this series\n\nBack in 1975. When I was with Greenpeace, we intervened against the Soviet whaling fleet in the Pacific Ocean.\n\nWatson was on a ship that tried to stop a Soviet ship from killing a whale.\n\nThey had harpooned this large bull whale, and he turned the swam right underneath us and threw himself up at the bow of the Soviet vessel, and they were waiting for him and pulled the trigger, sent an explosive harpoon into his head, and the whale fell back into the water, rolling in agony on the surface, there's blood everywhere. And I caught his eye and suddenly he dove and he came straight towards us, and he came up and out of the water at an angle so that the next move is to fall down and crush us. And as his head rose up out of the water, and I looked into his eye, which is right there so close, I could seep my reflection of myself and that eye as he rose up out of the water, I felt that the whale understood what we were trying to do because I could see the effort he made to pull himself back, and he began to sink back into the sea.\n\nHis eye disappeared beneath the surface, and he died. He could have killed us and chose not to do so.\n\nWhether the whale actually chose to not kill Paul Watson isn't something that we can fact check anyway,\n\nBut it also got me to thinking, why? Why were we killing those whales? The Soviets were killing sperm whales for sper Massetti oil and sperm oil. They're not edible. And the primary use for that was in the construction and maintenance of intercontinental ballistic missiles.\n\nThis is something we can fact check. It is true that the Soviets used sperm whale oil for military purposes, but they also killed lots of other kinds of whales, mostly to comply with the directives of their centrally planned economy. There wasn't much demand for whale oil or meat in the Soviet Union, but you can see why an activist like Paul Watson might find it attractive to combine whale saving with military disarmament.\n\nAnd I said to myself, here we are destroying these incredibly beautiful, intelligent, self-aware sentient beings for the purpose of making a weapon meant for the mass extermination of human beings. And that's when it just struck me. We're insane. So I said to myself from then on in, I'm gonna do this for them, not for us, but for them.\n\nNews of Paul Watson's encounter with the Soviet ship helped drive the Save the whales movement. But Watson's confrontational tactics weren't well received within Greenpeace, and he was ousted by their board. He continues to use similar tactics. Today under the name of the captain, Paul Watson Foundation, he says that direct action like interfering with whaling ships or even sinking a whaling ship, is justified by the horror of whale hunting.\n\nOur bottom line is we don't hurt anybody. It's a strategy called aggressive nonviolence.\n\nI'm curious to know whether you interact or have interacted much with whalers directly and tried to understand their perspective.\n\nI've had many sit down debates with whalers, ex whalers in Australia, whalers in Norway, many at the International Whaling Commission, not with the Japanese. They just refuse.\n\nWe tried ourselves for months to sit down with whalers to hear their perspective. Apparently the few remaining commercial whalers are so used to seeing their industry portrayed as barbaric, that they avoid speaking publicly. After this series was first published, we did finally hear from one Norwegian whaler named Bjorn Anderson. You'll hear that conversation later in this series. Meanwhile, we'll hear more from Jay Alabaster about how he gained the trust of Japanese whalers.\n\nI had to give this speech in front of them, and they debated and debated.\n\nThat's coming up after a quick break. I'm Steven Dubner. This is Freakonomics Radio. We'll be right back. In 2009, the world was shocked to see the Japanese wailing industry on the big screen.\n\nRight now, I'm focused in on that one little body of water where that slaughter takes place.\n\nIt was a documentary film called The Cove.\n\nIf we can't stop that, if we can't fix that, forget about the bigger issues.\n\nThe film was about dolphin hunting in the town of Taiji. In case you've forgotten your middle school biology. Yes, dolphins are whales. They, along with porpoises and a variety of bigger animals that we call whales, all belong to the Satan Infra Order. Anyway, the film follows Rick o' Barry, a dolphin trainer, turned anti whaling activist, critiquing the practice of whale hunting in Japan back in the States. The Cove was nominated for an Academy Award. Jay Alabaster, the American journalist we met earlier, was living in Tokyo. The Associated Press sent him to Taiji.\n\nSomeone had to be in the town in case it won. So I went to the town to cover and talk to people and just get the reaction. Ties is one of the few locations where whaling has basically gone on uninterrupted for several centuries. It was a really remote little town. When I got there, no one would talk to me. So I was walking around this town, which is amazingly beautiful and remote and quaint, and people were incredibly nice. No one was rude to me or threatening or anything, but no one would answer any of my questions or anything.\n\nTaiji did not like the attention the film had brought.\n\nThey had already gone through the protests of Greenpeace and the anti wailing movement. They just saw this as another anti wailing swing against them in a long string of them from the west. In order to speak to the fishermen and the community members, I had to kind of involve myself in this society. There's 12 of them that kind of run the boats, and it's a union, so they all have equal power, so they all have to agree. So I had to give this speech in front of them, you know, tell them why I wanted to do this and what I hope to accomplish. And they debated and debated, and finally I was allowed to hang out with them before and after they went on the hunts.\n\nIn Taiji, whaling is done using a method called drive Hunting.\n\nAs long as the weather is acceptable and they don't have something else going on, they'll go out every single morning. There's 12 boats if they're all operating and they kind of spread out in a fan with Taji at its center, and they go out about 15 miles at a relatively slow speed, and they're just scanning, scanning, scanning the horizon, looking for birds or spouts anything, give him a hint that there's one of the species that they're allowed to catch. And if one of them finds a species, he'll call it in on the radio, and the 12 will have like an impromptu conference on their wireless radios. And if they decide to go for it, they'll all assemble behind the pod and they'll line up the boats, and then they have these metal poles that are kind of flanged at the bottom, and they'll put the flange side into the water, and they're very long, they're very coordinated.\n\nThey'll just push the pod slowly, slowly, slowly towards Taiji, and then they get 'em to a certain cove, you know, the cove and seal it off with ropes, and then either take the animals for meat or live for show animals. That's one thing that's unique on Taji is that because they do this method of hunting, the animals aren't killed at sea.\n\nAlabaster tried to learn about the economics of whaling in Taiji.\n\nThe prices are quite hidden. They're not published anywhere, so it's quite difficult to get a hard read, but it's very clear that the live animals are worth far more than the animals that they sell for meat. They only actually eat two commonly. The short fin pilot whale and the striped dolphin are the two that are celebrated, and one of those animals will go for between 500 and a thousand dollars, I think, for meat. But another animal, say a bottle nose dolphin, which is the show animal that you often see in aquariums, kinda the flipper, you know, they can go for 10, $20,000. So there's a huge difference there.\n\nThe film about Taiji whaling condemns both the killing of whales for meat and selling them to a dolphinarium.\n\nWhen I started out, there were only three dolphinariums. Today it's become a multi-billion dollar industry, and all of these captures you help create the largest slaughter of dolphins on the planet,\n\nAnd the winner is the Cove.\n\nThat's right. The cove won the Oscar for best documentary. Taiji and Japan more generally were almost universally chastised for allowing wailing to continue. Jay Alabaster, having seen things from the inside, felt there was a bigger story to be told. So he decided to get a PhD in journalism and mass communications. He is currently writing his dissertation.\n\nYeah, so that's kind of how the domestic and the international media cover this little town of Taiji, the debate that swirls around it and the history of the town itself.\n\nSince the beginning of the anti wailing movement, Japan has often been the primary target, much more so. For some reason, the Norway or Iceland, when the International Whaling Commission declared an outright ban on commercial whaling in 1982, Japan objected and allowed its whaling industry to continue supposedly for research purposes. In 2019, Japan left the IWC and resumed commercial wailing. This prompted Boris Johnson soon to be Prime Minister of the uk, to publish an opinion piece with the headline. Why is there not more outrage about Japan's barbaric practice of wailing?\n\nJapan's chief cabinet secretary at the time, Yoshi de Suga defended the decision engagement in wailing, he said, has been supporting local communities in its long history. Japan has used whales not only as a source of protein, but also for a variety of other purposes. These included fertilizer and insect repellent, musical instruments and board game pieces. But Jay Alabaster has seen how weak Japan's defensive arguments can seem in the face of anti wailing activism.\n\nThere are these powerful environmental groups, and when I say powerful, I don't mean in a negative way. They're just powerful and they apply the pressure to kind of tweak the world in the way that they want, and they're often very successful. And a little town like Taiji, which has 3000 people and no international presence, there's no one there that really does social media officially. In looking historically, those towns don't tend to do so well when the kind of pressure that is applied and Taiji has applied to them. But Taiji was very robust, held up, received incredible domestic assistance.\n\nI think for Japan, it comes down to the fact that they've always been very concerned that if there's a successful end into whaling, what does that then mean for other parts of their fisheries industry?\n\nThat again, is Kate O'Connell from the Animal Welfare Institute,\n\nAnd in particular tuna, they're very focused on their tuna industries, and so they're very nervous that, you know, will they then come after our tuna?\n\nThere's one big difference to point out. Global demand for tuna is strong for whale meat, not so much.\n\nAll the fishermen in Taiji talk about this time in the eighties and nineties when the prices were incredibly high, and in one season they would make enough to buy a house.\n\nJay Alabaster says that whale meat now gets maybe one third or even less the price it used to sell for. That's good news. If you eat whale meat,\n\nWhale is served across Japan, and it has regional varieties. One common one is called tga. It's like fried whale, which is the easiest to eat. Whale has a certain flavor to it, and if you're not used to it, it's not good. I have trouble with it as well. So it's kind of seasoned to disguise that the raw whale, although this just sounds from a western perspective, it just sounds awful. But Japan has a long history of obviously, of eating raw fish, and they eat whale that's been freshly caught, lightly cooked, or not cooked at all. And if you're a meat eater like I am, it is incredible meat when it's still fresh.\n\nBut alabaster says the overall amount of whale meat consumed, even in Japan is very small.\n\nSo the average person eats, it doesn't even register on the decimal, that 0.0% of their diet as well. I don't know what would be an equivalent in the us, but maybe if you saw a rabbit on the menu or something like that, you'd be like, oh, that's inter, or crawdad, or something like that. You know, you wouldn't be floored, but you'd be, oh, that's kind of interesting. They have crawdad.\n\nBut here's the thing. In Japan, even if you don't eat whale, you may not want whale hunting to end.\n\nPolls have shown that most people, I think 60 or 70% of people support whaling or Japan's right to whale, even if they don't eat whale themselves in broader Japan, there is no question that the outside pressure has given a huge boost to wailing. It's one of the few issues I've seen in Japan where across the political spectrum, their support for wailing,\n\nThe Japanese can always say, well, this is our tradition.\n\nAnd that again, is the longtime anti wailing activist Paul Watson. When\n\nA species becomes endangered like the Bowhead, there can be no justification for any tradition, any culture.",

So how does, how do we go from the CIA 1979 to Shaw Ayatollah Nixon? What is the thread that now starts inching towards the nineties and right towards nine 11 in Iraq?\n\nI know there's so much, but we're gonna do it, man. So here's what happens. America goes ahead and allows, I get on the plane in Paris, France and go home. Now I remember even as a kid saying, but aren't the French our friends, when they had checked with us before doing that? In fact, I just recently found the clip of Peter Jennings interviewing him. And the smartest thing Peter Jennings can think of to say is, so how do you feel on your triumphant return, Mr. Ayatollah, right? Which USA is just completely aiding and abetting, right? These are shots they called and made happen, right? They sent him home to inherit the thing, and then they did work with him. People forget, man, and I was just very young at that time, but I, you know, was raised kind of in the atmosphere of all of this.\n\nAnd even back then, people conflated the revolution itself with the hostage crisis as just one story. It all is spoken in one breath, but in fact, the revolution was in February of 1979 and the hostage crisis didn't break out until November. So what was happening in the meantime? Well, one of the things was the Americans were warning the new Iranian regime about threats from the new dictator of Iraq, Saddam Hussein, who had just overthrown the government in a bloody coup deta no revolution there. And you can watch the video this, have you ever seen the video Saddam's overthrowing Iraq? And he, he's got a huge stadium of guys and he just starts calling names and everybody whose name he calls has to go out back and get shot.\n\nLike it's gnarly,\n\nMan. I think that video is a dark study of human nature. It's terrifying. Oh it is.\n\nIt's ugly, man.\n\nThat's because everybody is afraid. And of, there's a disgusting face. This ANM saying has, oh, I don't know. I don't know if, if there's a sadistic,\n\nSure he was a psychopath, man. No question. He was a brute of a dictator, right? There's a lot of El Ps in the world. Not all of 'em, like train their sons to torture people from the time they're young and stuff.\n\nOh, fuck all the cow in that room. Yeah. But then you have to ask yourself, what would you do if you were in that room? Yeah,\n\nYou've already been bested at that point. I mean, they could all rush the stage, but that ain't gonna do 'em any good, you know? But before you,\n\nHow did you get to that room? Yeah. And then that's why you have to give props to whistleblowers. You have to give props to people that stand up and risk their life in situations like that, which in those parts of the world is even harder than it is in the United States of America.\n\nAnd you know what, by the way, I usually forget to mention this when I tell this story, takes another few seconds to mention that Saddam Husain had been groomed by the CIA since the 1950s on and off. And he had been part of different dictator regimes on and off. He'd been in exile in Cairo for a little while in this kind of thing. And then in the seventies leading up to the coup, I think it was really closer to the Soviet Union. And, and so we'll get to the, I guess I'll mention it now. There's a huge irony of the fact that in the Iran Iraq War, it was America supporting Saddam Hussein and his Soviet military versus Iran, and its American one, right?\n\nBut\n\nAnyway, the absurdity of this is\n\nInsane. Yeah. Well, I'm skipping ahead a step, but I just like that part. Yeah. But so, okay, so America supports the revolution in 79 in February. They're warning this guy, Hey, you better look out for Saddam Hussein and his intentions, and we're gonna get back to that in one moment here. And they were also warning them about the threat from the Soviet Union. Now why is that? Well, that's because skip over Iran. Now we're talking about Afghanistan and Binni Pensky's policy, but let's support the mujahideen in Afghanistan in order to try to provoke Soviet intervention there. And so there's a memo, and people can find this at Scott Horton dot org slash bear use.\n\nIf you wanna look at it, it's from, you wanna go ahead and pull it up? Yeah.\n\nSo if you, if you allow me to read President Jimmy Carter's July 3rd, 1979, finding authorizing covert support for the mujahideen in Afghanistan, secret sensitive.\n\nAnd the important part is provide unilaterally or through third countries as appropriate support tog Afghani insurgents. This is now a finding is an order from a president to the CIA to do something. That's what a finding means. So this is a order to CIA to do this. Now, on that order, they did start pouring in support to the Moja id. Now I have to tell you that my best experts on this, like Eric Margolies, and I got this also from reading Andre ov the famous Soviet nuclear physicist and dissident, that they both said that it wasn't American support for the mujahideen that really provoked the Russians into invading Afghanistan. Because what it was, was the sock puppet dictator was a basket case.\n\nAnd he had created so many enemies that he just couldn't hold it together. So the first thing the Soviets did when they invaded in December of 79 was take him out back and shoot him and replace him with a new guy. So that was really the cause of the Soviet intervention there. They had a ka sock puppet regime. It was not one of the Soviet republics, right? But they had a sock puppet regime there. But they, they wanted to, you know, maintain it and it was falling apart. So they rushed to intervene. However, Lex, the point still remains that the United States of America was trying to bait the Soviet Union into invading Afghanistan. And we're gonna get back to why this is so relevant to the Iran thing in just one second. But let's stop and talk about this for a second.\n\nWhy would they do that? And they would do that also because of Vietnam. Because at the end of Vietnam, Americans had what the government considered to be a mental illness Vietnam syndrome. That meant that Americans didn't want to do this anymore, contain communism at this cost, and who really cares if Vietnam goes com, we do business with him now. And you know, and so people weren't into it anymore. So this is, where's the big Brezinski? And his, he was National Security Advisor under Jimmy Carter and his, I guess counterpart at defense, a guy named Walter Slocum. They came up with this brilliant idea that what we'll do is we will bait the Soviets into over expansion.\n\nNow, we don't want 'em to invade West Germany, but the Afghans are expendable. So if we can bait the Soviets into Afghanistan and bog them down, we will be adding straw to the camel's back. This is a way to inflict, because by then, think of it the word Vietnam. That's not even the name of a country over there somewhere anymore. Vietnam at that time. That word means some horrible, stupid, no win quagmire thing that you shouldn't have done. You shot yourself in the foot and the leg and lost your friend Jimmy down the street and everything. And for we don't wanna do that, you know, that was what Vietnam meant to America was like, God dang, what a mistake that was. So now they're saying, let's do that to the Reds.\n\nOkay, we'll bog them down, believe them to bankruptcy and force 'em out the hard way and and hurt 'em in doing that. So that's what they were trying to do. That was the wisdom behind the operation in the first place. And now if you go click back one to Brezinski, you'll see where, and he later mis paraphrases this a little bit. He's kind of cute brezinski, but\n\nNational security advisors, big new Brzezinski's memo to President Carter on December 26th, 1979, regarding the Soviet invasion of, of Afghanistan.\n\nAnd the important part here, I mean, there's a lot, it's a bit, but if you go down, you'll see where, oh, here, this could become a Soviet Vietnam while it could become a Soviet Vietnam. In other words, see, they're already talking about in that context here in writing, we see, and it's from Robert Gates's first memoir, by the way, where he says it was brezinski and slocum. By the way, that's my source for that. When I say that those two were the ones really innovating this policy. And he says the initial effects of the invention are likely to be adverse for us for the following reasons. And then he says that it'll make the hawks talk about how we better do something about Iran. And he says, this could bring us into a head to head confrontation with the Soviets.\n\nSo this is very interesting, Lex, because, well, one, this is why America's passing intelligence to the Ayatollah about threats from the Soviets. We think that now that Iran is essentially destabilized because of the revolution, and we just deliberately, or at least were trying to, and apparently succeeded in a sense, in baiting them into invading Afghanistan. Now we're worried that they're too expansionists and that they're gonna roll into Persia next, and then they'd be right on the Persian Gulf. And we can't have that. So that was when Jimmy Carter announced in his speech in 1980, the Carter Doctrine that said that the Persian Gulf is now an American lake, and we'll take any move by any power, read the USSR to move into the Persian Gulf as an attack on the United States itself, right?\n\nWe're like, we're bringing the Gulf, those waters in nato, right? Given a full war guarantee to keep the Soviets. They, and by the way, a regime, oh, I'm sorry, I'm skipping one. See, go back. Forgive me for the, it's hard to, to stay in line here. The hostage crisis breaks out in November 79 because David Rockefeller from, of course, standard Oil of New Jersey, AKA Exxon and Aramco and all those things, the chairman of the Chase Manhattan Bank, at that time, he was very close with Jimmy Carter, and he convinced Carter to let the S Shah into the United States for cancer treatment. And that was what caused the riot at the embassy and the seizure of the hostages. Now, I don't know, and, and I'm sure there are books about this that I just haven't read yet, you know, kind of thing that explain whether it really was the IRGC that took the lead in that, or whether it was the students who did it or what.\n\nBut obviously the government held the hostages and kept the thing going. So they bear responsibility for that. But the point being that America had been trying to work with the Ayatollah up until then, the idea was not that, oh, Shiite fundamentalist Islam says that all white Christians from North America must lay down dead right now because that's their religious belief. Look at them ranting. We are the great Satan and burning our flag. And then, but so when so many people, when the story begins with their calling us great Satan and burning our flag, then well, they just hate us. And so we're just gonna have to do something about that. And you know, I, I remember meeting a guy one time who said, listen, Al-Qaeda hates us for all these complicated reasons.\n\nAnd he explained them and then he goes, but not Iran, they just hate us. I remember when I was a boy, they were burning our flag and calling us Satan. So it's like, yeah, but well they had a reason to not that it justifies them doing anything sinful or criminal, but I'm just saying they also had reasons for reacting the way that they reacted. America had launched a coup in 53 from that same embassy. And by saying that they were gonna cure the Shaw's cancer seemed to be an indication to them that we were gonna try to reinstall 'em in power and cancel the revolution. And so they were preempting that, again, not a justification for everything that happened there or whatever, but just to tell the whole story in a way that I've told that story to people before. And they're like, I never knew that. I always thought that it all happened in one big show. You know?\n\nAnd never do they admit, unless sometimes the Republicans accuse Carter of this, they'll tell the part about that Carter was so naive as to send the Ayatollah home, although that's usually always left out. But, so now he announces the Carter Doctrine, giving a war guarantee to Iran that he now officially hates and is holding our hostages and completely humiliating him, right? And there was Operation Eagle Claw where they sent forces into Iran, and that was a, it was supposed to be a rescue mission that ended up in disaster where the planes and the helicopters crashed into each other. They were already leaving anyway, 'cause it was gonna be botched. And then they crashed on the way out.\n\nAnd so that was a big humiliation for Carter as well. And then, oh, and I should also tell you that Gareth just found this, it was a classified document that he only found in the State Department records that showed that just after the Carter Doctrine speech, Brezinski in a private meeting with the Saudi foreign minister and also with his deputy Warren Christopher, who was later Clinton's Secretary of Defense, he admitted that we don't think there's really a Soviet threat to Iran. Brazinski himself admitted that. So the pretext for the Carter to doctrine was fake. And he admitted himself, they weren't really afraid of that, even though they were pretending to be afraid of that as a result of the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan that they were trying to provoke.\n\nAnd we should also give a shout out to Gareth Porter. He has written about the Vietnam War books, including perils of dominance and balance of power and the Road to war in Vietnam. And\n\nI have to say, I believe that he is the most important journalist of the War on terrorism era. I call him Gareth the Great, he's a good friend of mine. I've interviewed him 300 something times on my show about essentially everything he's written since 2007. He is the best of the best of\n\nThe best. It's not just the war in Vietnam, it's he, he writes also about the continued\n\nVoice absolutely specialized in Iraq, Afghanistan, exposing the entire fraud of David Petraeus and his career. He wrote the book Manufactured Crisis on the Iranian Nuclear Program. That is far none the, the very best book on that. You absolutely\n\nVietnam, Cambodia, Syria, Iran, and The War on Terror. All the things he's written extensively about\n\nGareth Porter, the great man. Absolutely. God, the great, I learned so much from him. I, I couldn't begin to explain. Fair\n\nEnough. So the story continues. Yes, Carter.\n\nSo another aspect of the Carter Doctrine was that Carter gave the green light to Saddam Hussein to invade Iran. Now first thing is why Saddam Hussein wanna invade Iran. It ain't just 'cause he likes doing what Jimmy Carter says. He had his own Reeses. Now picture your map over rock. I know you got one in your head there. Everything from Baghdad over east to Iran and down to Kuwait. That is what you could call Shia Stan, predominantly Shiite, Iraq, right? And then they're 60% of the population, super majority in the North. You have the Kurds who are Sunnis, but their Kurds is separate ethnicity, then the Arabs.\n\nAnd then you have the Sunni Arabs who are another 20%. Well, Saddam Hussein was a secular Sunni Arab leading, essentially like, like on the Simpsons, the Kami Nazis, the both party who are like sort of both a little, just a fascist state essentially, right? With Arab characteristics or whatever. And, but, and, and not an entirely sectarian one. He had Christians and Kurds and Shiites in his government and things like that. It was not, you know, like just a caricature or whatever. It was a balance of power act. But after the Iranian revolution, Saddam had a real reason to fear that the Shiite revolution was gonna spread to Iraq. And that Iraqi Shiites, at least the armed and convinced ones would choose their religious sect and their alliance with Iran on that basis over their national and ethnic sect as Iraqis and Arabs, right?",

      "transcript_chunk": "Patrick Deneen is a professor in the political science department at Notre Dame, the Catholic University in Indiana that was founded in 1842. But he is not a political scientist. He's quick to point this out and he has a lot of practice pointing it out because that's what most people think he is. He calls himself a political theorist or a political philosopher. Another thing he is not is a political operative, although that's the impression you might have gotten. If you read a recent Wall Street Journal article with this headline, the ideological gurus battling for the Soul of Trump world. That's certainly the impression that I got. Here's the sub headline of that article.\n\nTechno Libertarian, Curtis Jarvin and Catholic Conservative Patrick Deneen have just one thing in common, a desire to destroy the American establishment. Here's one line from that article by Joshua Chaffin and Zha Ellenson on one side are tech bros racing to create a new future on the other, a resurgent band of conservative Catholics who yearn for an imagined past. Until I read that article, I had not heard of Patrick Deneen, which I'm a bit embarrassed to say because he's a pretty big name in some of the circles I try to keep up on. He's best known for writing a widely read book called Why Liberalism Failed. It was published in 2018, not by a commercial publisher, but by Yale University Press.\n\nMaybe that's why it didn't have a sexy subtitle. It was simply why liberalism failed like a hammer fist. If a commercial house had published it. There might have been a subtitle, like a Soft spoken Political Scientist reveals a Hidden Schism in the Soul of America. The Book's Forward, which was written by a pair of Yale editors, argued that Deen's book is disruptive, not only for the way it links social maladies to liberalism's first principles, but also because it is difficult to categorize along our conventional left right spectrum. Indeed, the book was praised by everyone from Barack Obama to Victor Orban, the autocratic Prime Minister of Hungary.\n\nOne of the books most enthusiastic readers was JD Vance, who four years after its publication was elected to the Senate and two years after that became Donald Trump's vice President. This gets us back to that Wall Street Journal article. It implies that Patrick Deneen is one of the main intellectual forces behind the second Trump administration, an ideological guru as the journal put it in the headline, is that how Deneen sees himself?\n\nI don't view myself as an ideological guru, no. It's been a very interesting period of my life. I consider myself really just a kind of scholarly academic who writes books. You'll notice if you read that article, which you did, that there's no actual direct quote from me. The consequence of now having had this very tendentious set of misrepresentations in the media has now led me to decline all requests for interviews. So\n\nYou were asked for an interview for that piece?\n\nI was and I declined.\n\nAnd what about the subhead about your desire to destroy the American establishment? How accurate is that? Do you want to destroy the American establishment, Patrick?\n\nNo,\n\nI was happy Janine didn't decline our request for an interview. And so today on Freakonomics Radio, I ask Patrick Deneen a lot of questions and he, being a well-trained Socratic professor asks some questions of his own.\n\nWhat would decrease the distance between the many and the few in our country? How is it that we're going to get very good leaders if our assumption is that ordinary people are idiots? How do we generate a sense of civic, common good, and solidarity?\n\nYou'll notice that deneen does not sound like most of the prominent academics you hear from these days.\n\nI'll admit to being sympathetic with the populist uprising in our country. I might be like one of three professors in America for whom that's true.\n\nHis most recent book, by the way, is called Regime Change Toward a Postliberal Future. So here's one more question we'll try to answer today. Is that future already here?\n\nThis is Freakonomics Radio, the podcast that explores the hidden side of everything with your hosts. S Steven Dubner.\n\nPatrick Deneen was born in 1964 and grew up outside of Hartford, Connecticut. His father was an insurance executive.\n\nI was raised Catholic and as a grandchild or great-grandchild of Irish and French Catholic immigrants. It deeply formed my worldview that I'll use Aquinas's phrase, humans are by nature, social and political animals. That aspect or feature of our humanity nevertheless needs cultivation. We have strong counter tendencies. And those counter tendencies are for self-aggrandizement, pride, individualism, the belief in our own autonomy.\n\nAlthough Denine was raised Catholic, he didn't start reading deeply in Catholic philosophy until he was a college student at Rutgers.\n\nYes, that's right. I would attribute it. My first encounter with Alexis de Tocqueville reading democracy in America. He himself had a crisis of faith, but he was raised and educated as a Catholic when I was a freshman, recognizing his praise of the small town model of democracy, township democracy that he witnessed in New England, it spoke to me. 'cause I felt like he's talking about the town I grew up in, Windsor, Connecticut.\n\nI always wondered if Tocqueville would've felt the same had he settled down and lived here. 'cause you know, every time I go to a new place, I'm wowed by the things that they do differently, that are better than we do at home. And then I think, well, what if I moved here for a year? Would I realize that nasty, brutish, and short all over again with a different accent? I\n\nThink the things that he valued about America, he would still find of profound value. It shocked him to discover in America that when there was a problem, like there was a pothole or a bridge fell down, that Americans didn't necessarily wait for government to come out and solve it. That there was a spirit of entrepreneurial like, we can do it. We will fix this.\n\nYou've said that we need to get back to a time where more people do more things for themselves. Fixing their cars with their own hands is one example you use. I mean, no disrespect metric, but I don't want to live in that world. I, for one, have no idea how to fix my car or you know, program a supercomputer or fly an airplane, any of those things. So I'm a big believer in the division of labor and in opportunity cost and in comparative advantage, these basic tenets of economic thinking. But I gather that you disagree with a lot of those tenets. Can you just talk for a moment about how you think that economic theory, going back to Adam Smith, let's say, has been either abused or its merits exaggerated perhaps?\n\nI'm certainly not an opponent of the idea of division of labor, which I think is a basic aspect of our human reality. We're just born with different gifts and abilities, and I'm glad, for example, I'm not an auto mechanic by trade because I'd probably be pretty bad at it. But that part of the argument in the book was really more about how we have institutionalized a kind of ignorance pertaining to our everyday life. The ability to manipulate and understand basic phenomenon of whatever it might be. I'm a gardener. I actually have great tomato plants coming in right now. Many more people in an earlier time would grow some of their food.\n\nThey would maybe have some livestock or some chickens or something. My grandmother had a little farm in an area now that's been turned into developments, the ability to do basic things in your home, the ability to fix things that doesn't exclude the fact that we also have abilities maybe in our professional lives or our volunteer lives that do draw on our special gifts, those talents that mysteriously seem to be distributed widely.\n\nI guess what I would argue if I wanted to channel someone from the field of positive psychology for a minute is why not both? And instead of either or. I mean, the very fact that you and I are able to have this conversation right now, you in South Bend, Indiana in a studio me in New York City in my studio, and it's extraordinarily efficient and productive and convenient, and I love that. On the other hand, all the value of doing things with your hands and knowing how things are made, I mean, those are also available to me. So I don't see it as an either or. When I read your work, I do feel that your embrace of the value of the real, let's call it does have a nostalgic tint to it.\n\nIt feels to me a bit like a retreat. So I'm curious to know you as a person, as a political thinker, as a husband and father and so on, do you feel that you were born in the wrong time, perhaps?\n\nNo. Because what you describe as a kind of nostalgia for a bygone era of things that are no longer recoverable, I view as permanent possibilities. For me, that's the great advantage of my discipline political philosophy is we are reading the wide swath of the greatest texts, not as maybe a historian would to see, you know, what did Rousseau think in the 17 hundreds? That was the consequence of physical and contingent events that are never ever to be repeated, and therefore you read it merely as a kind of historical record.\n\nWhereas when a political philosopher reads Rousseau, I'm reading possibilities when I'm read Aristotle, I'm reading possibilities, live possibilities with the understanding that there are specific historical context, but nevertheless that humanity is still more or less the same between 400 BC and today we're driven by fundamentally similar desires. Our natures are fundamentally recognizable. Divisional labor is a very old concept, and we find examples of it in the Bible. We know Cain and Abel get into a pretty bad argument with a bad outcome, maybe based in some ways on different jobs that they have. But the division of labor has been understood since the most ancient of times.\n\nI'm a big fan of Plato's Republic and Plato's Republic begins with a long discussion of division of labor and the role that it plays in the formation of human society. What Plato Socrates lays out in that beginning of that dialogue is that the division of labor can be understood as the source of contestation or separation or distance.\n\nSounds a little Marxist.\n\nWell, Marx was of course very familiar with this tradition as was Smith. We live in a world in which the latter understanding of division of labor predominates, we all get the advantages and benefits of everyone living in a kind of smithy and world in which we understand the division of labor as the thing that I do in which I don't necessarily have to know, care, understand what you do, and we rely on this invisible hand to make it all work. But I think that conception, while it has certain advantages, it has profound disadvantages, fragmentation, ignorance of what other people do.\n\nWe have all in a sense relieved ourselves of that obligation. And where do we see the evidence or the manifestation of how our work fits together? It's typically in a community, it's in a community of scale or solidarity in which the banker can understand how the granting of mortgages will have a broader implication on the life and fabric of the community versus what happens in 2008. And if I have the smithian understanding, I'm just putting heads on pins. I don't know what the pin does. I don't care what the pin does. If you're a member of a community, you care about the pin, you care about its destination and you care about its origin.\n\nSo how do we expand the understanding of our work to include some glimpse of that? We're never gonna have a comprehensive glimpse, but some glimpse that draws us out of the narrowness. That I think is the cause of a lot of the pathologies of modern society, to be frank.\n\nSay a little bit more about that. How does that narrowness cause these pathologies? Is it the individuals remove from the community per se? Because on the one hand, as you're describing these problems, I wonder if part of the issue is simply scale, right? We're at 8 billion people now, and when Aristotle was doing his thinking, when Rousseau was doing his thinking, communities did still dominate in most places, correct?\n\nYes. And in fact, Aristotle's quite clear that a polis or a political community that is larger than the expanse or ability of the human senses to comprehend that community is now too big. We are now living at a scale that many political philosophers of early ages would've regarded as catastrophic in terms of the ability to form some form of human solidarity. And I think we dismiss those concerns at our peril.\n\nSo how much do you think that scale itself is the core of the problem? And if it is the core of the problem, what are we supposed to do about it? I assume you don't wanna say, well, let's take the last 7 billion people who were born and get rid of them and get back to a manageable size. Yeah,\n\nI'm a Catholic, so no, that's not my preferred solution.\n\nSo how can you amend the current scale driven problem?\n\nThe challenge and problem of scale has been recognized well before there were even a billion people on the planet. It's not a problem we're facing necessarily because of population. It's how we've organized ourselves with the concept of vision of labor being one of the problems, politics and the nature of politics being another one. And here we could begin to touch on concepts for example of democracy. One of the innovations that's very self-consciously and innovation on the part of our founding fathers was that the problem of scale could be overcome by a new form of representation. In Federalist 10, maybe the most famous of the Federalist Papers, James Madison makes an extraordinary argument that is essentially a frontal effort to dismiss and defeat the arguments of the likes of Aristotle, or even Montesquieu, for example, in which he argues that the way to solve the problem of faction in politics is not through what Aristotle and the classical tradition had believed, which is the cultivation of certain kinds of civic virtue and solidarity and common good.\n\nIt was by actually expanding the orbit, enlarging the sphere, he says, increasing the scale and size of the political order, in our case, the Nation of America. So that among other things, we would have difficulty communicating with each other. We would not be able to concert and scheme together. And he said it would increase the level of mistrust among the citizenry toward each other. Now that's an extraordinary argument because what it's essentially saying is that discord and mistrust and difficulty communicating will be the basis of what we now call democracy.\n\nDoes that sound unfamiliar to listeners? In other words, we've achieved the ends and yet many of us today are not terribly happy with that particular outcome.\n\nI don't have the citation handy, but there's something you wrote about how all political regimes throughout history have a sort of tension built into them that democracy is a regime of the many and that oligarchy is a regime of the few. And within that statement is the assertion that neither system is sufficient. Can you describe the tension between those two? And what I really wanna get to is which type of political regime you feel is most successful at promoting a common good?\n\nWell, that site is from my most recent book, which is called Regime Change, not to Be Too Uncontroversial. So I picked a, an anodyne title.\n\nWell, it's a little bit different if you write a book called Regime Change in America than if you write it in Iran or North Korea, just for the record, right?\n\nWell, but it is a book written primarily for the need for regime change in America, but in a very specific way. We have in some ways created a regime that has led us to the point where many of our fellow citizens will say, we're too divided. We have no sense of what the common good is. There is no common good, there's only individual interest.",

      "transcript_chunk": "se. And China currently has this AI plus program, which is about pushing AI into every single plausible sector with the help of the state. So adoption diffusion is very important. Why China can't do breakthroughs or can't do zero to one technologies, I think at the root of it, and there are some deeper, we talked about the, the, the proximate reasons, the short, flat, fast, for instance, right?\n\nYou don't wanna spend too much time on investigating something that you don't even know if it's commercially viable. So basic research is still weaker than in the US universities, but also this kind of intrinsic motivation. It's very different, right? In China, it's driven by extrinsic motivation. You are rewarded by, you know, compensation, financial compensation, all these kind of extrinsic motivation is what drives you. But intrinsic motivation, pursuit of knowledge for knowledge sake, right? That was deep in the Confucius philosophies. But of course, you know, poverty has changed all that. The profound commitment to scholarship, to research, which we know is very much true in the US universities.\n\nThat's, it's starting. It's starting, but it's not there. So I think these two approaches are actually quite compatible with each other. I don't know what all this fuss is about, right? China uses technology very well. It can scale up and reduce costs, and then it can spread it around. And the US you know, has, makes the highest value added by inventing these technologies. But, you know, again, diffusion matters.\n\nWell, yeah, the things you mentioned, the, the scale, the manufacturing, the diffusion, from a sort of economics perspective, you wonder, which is the more important skill to have. And it seems like the cost cutting, the efficient, large scale fast manufacturer, the diffusion is much more important for the success and the growth of the economy.\n\nI think where it ultimately leads an impact on the economy, that's more important. It's this persistent question we have. Why don't we see the productivity in the numbers, right? You're in ai, ai, we had long periods of investment, right? You just don't, you haven't, you hadn't seen it in the numbers until maybe even recently, and it's still very slow. But China's pushing that in the sectors, you know, robotics, ai, cloud, industrial internet of things. And even companies like Huawei, I think it's gotten a little bit of too, too bad of a rep in, in the us but American engineers working for Huawei said that it's, you know, they're so happy working for Huawei.\n\nThe intent focus on innovation, but also on solution driven innovations in Africa, in rural areas, really changes people's lives. It doesn't change the world, but it changes individuals' lives.\n\nWhat's the feeling that Chinese entrepreneurs have about copying technology? Because I think one of the cultural things in the US is just really not respected. If you copy Yeah. Yeah. So like that's not seen, that's seen as a big problem. And is there some degree to where in China that's not,\n\nNo, unfortunately this is a big cultural difference. Our, our sense of property rights is actually quite different from the us. I think that will change over time. But absolutely, you're right. They are, they have no qualms about copying as long as it leads to success, right? That's the difference in values. As we mentioned in the beginning, you asked why, why the level of competition is so fierce. Well, they all do the same thing. Once they've seen one successful thing, everybody does the same thing. You'd have no respect for doing that in the us right? But in China it's all fine, but I think that over time it will change. Just give it a little bit of time.\n\nSo do you fundamentally, it's a bad thing\n\nIn the end. If China's all about innovation technology, you cannot not have very strict IP protection. True. Right? And ultimately, again, we're still in the short, flat fast yeah. Stage, right? Yeah. When we graduate from that stage, you're gonna have very different views about these things. And you gonna try to diversify and do different things. But again, it's a stage Chinese people were hungry. They're still a little bit hungry. Hungry. They're not gonna be as hungry in the future.\n\nSo can you describe the DeepSeek moment and deep seek as it represents what China's thinking about in the space of ai? And does China have a chance at out running us in the AI race?\n\nDeep seek was a surprise to the world, but I don't think it was that much of a surprise to the same degree to the Chinese. And remember that deep sea happened in times of crisis. Urgency, not in times of comfort. A lot of these technological breakthroughs and leapfrogging happens in times of crisis. This is called crisis innovation. And you gotta thank the US for that, right? When the Chinese were comfortably importing chips from the us, the whole industry stalled for 20 years. I mean, why would you plow in billions, tens of billions and even more when you can just import the best, right?\n\nYou don't wanna do your own innovation. It's because of these export controls, these sanctions on these companies, that Chinese companies in the Chinese state felt an existential crisis a few years ago on being, by being cut off from these critical components. And guess what happened in a short amount of time? The a degree of domestic capacity ramping up and catch up has been nothing short of remarkable. Again, thanks to us truculence on technology. Now, I'm sure there are many aspects of hypo hyperbole related to deep seek, but it just shows you that the gap is much smaller between the China and the US on leading edge technologies than what was expected that these export controls were not effective.\n\nThey may have even backfired. And it shows you that China has this relentless focus on taking some of the existing technologies and using scale and the, the advantages to cut cost and to diffuse. And this is just the beginning. I think it will happen in many other industries as well, including in semiconductors. And that's a Chinese approach. Now, there's an interesting dilemma here, which is that this is happening at, in a time of extreme economic softness, slow down and missed uncertainty, trade wars, a lack of confidence, a slow down in private investment and consumption, a withdrawal of foreign investment from China, especially the US venture funding.\n\nImagine what China had would've been like, let's say, if the economy was doing better, right? But you could also argue that it's because people feel threatened that they make more leaves. Now, I wish the world is not, we don't have to, you know, drive each other to the corners to do something great. But that is the reality. And I don't think that there's an easy say between who wins, because I think the winning idea is part of the old playbook, right? You're all kind of part of a network. Different countries, different players have different choke points on each other. I don't think it's just about the US and China and what's more, you use your leverage once, and that leverage has a half-life.\n\nIt becomes a lot less effective the second time around, because other countries, other companies are gonna try to substitute away, you know, if China uses the rare earth leverage, which I think it is now a little bit, there will be alternatives and substitutes gotta be very, very careful of what coercion leverage means. Same thing with the us, right? So I think this is all the old thinking of who wins, who dominates. I think we need a new, new playbook.\n\nSo you, to you maybe when, when you refer to Biden and Trump, if you go back to Biden, it would be the CHIPS Act. So the export controls created unintended unexpected effect where it had the reverse\n\nGeo. I hope it was unintentional, otherwise I'd, you'd be questioning the level of intelligence of the US administration, right? But I think that the things they laid out did the opposite of what was intended. It sped up domestic capacity. It motivated the whole country to do this whole a nation program to go after technologies, kind of like the way they go after Olympics, right? Olympic gold medals. They wanted to maximize Olympic gold medals, and they put the whole nation at work on all the resources. And that's what China did. Huawei, another example, they were sanctioned. Guess what? They have come back to life stronger than ever before.\n\nAnd this is not unique to this episode. If we look at throughout history, these blockades don't work. The continental system actually indirectly led to industrial revolution in the uk when the, the Spanish kind of blockade the, the Portuguese, they came up with a very ferocious, forceful naval power. And you're talking about China here, they just don't lie down and lie flat and say, oh, we give up. Right? They're more motivated than ever before.\n\nSo the lesson is don't force people or nations into a corner.\n\nYeah. You make them have a very comfortable situation and they tend to become complacent. And, and they, they stagnate.\n\nAll right? So, so can you talk through the whole saga of the Trump's Tariffs that's still going on, especially Tariffs on China, from your perspective as an economist, to what degree was it justified? To what degree was it effective? To what degree is it bad policy for, for us, for the west, for the world, also for China,\n\nYou know, China has been preparing for this for the last five years. And for the return of Trump and for, and for Trump's maniac trade policies, you'd think that Trump also had five years to prepare for this battle with China. It didn't show. You can say that the Chinese, at least this time around, have played their hand pretty well when dealing with Trump's tariff threats and the trade war with a level of calibrated assertiveness. They have really thought through everything very elaborately. And look, you know, this is not good for either country.\n\nLet's just be clear. It's bad for, for us and China, and it's bad for the world. And every country has a stake in the US China trade war because whether you trade directly or indirectly with China, you're gonna be affected. They are one of the largest intermediate exporters in the world. And Chinese manufacturing goods anchor global manufacturing prices. The cumulative tariff burdens. When you get to Canada, when you get to Mexico, when you get to any other final destination, these Tariffs will affect you, right? So it's clearly very, very bad for the world.\n\nChina's core principles, and I, I think that this is not well understood from the rest of the world towards the US and something that they have kept up is equivalence, reciprocity, and realism. China's not gonna lower Tariffs unless the US does, right? You can kind of stand up to Trump like a man. That's the only way you know, to deal with Trump. That's its view. You the deal has to be realistic. The phase one deal of the last time wasn't realistic. And China thinks, look, the US is gonna use this as a leverage, right? That's not possible. This can't be seen as political concession. The deal has to be seen as mutual commerce.\n\nSo where China can have room to negotiate is opening up things like services. You know, American banks, American financial institutions have a lot of business to do in China. They can buy a limited number of more goods. They can discuss about transparency around rules and regulations on e-commerce, on data. All of that is fine, but don't confound economic issues with political issues. Hong Kong, Taiwan is not part of the deal, by the way, in case anyone was wondering, trying to change China's state hybrid private sector model, don't go there. Anything that challenges China's technology security, that's not really part of the discussion.\n\nI think that people have to be clear about also what China thinks and wants, and also the Chinese to be clear about what Trump wants, although I, I, I don't know anybody, even Trump himself knows exactly what he wants in order for, for these very complex negotiations to actually succeed.\n\nOkay, so China has a few red lines, so don't mention Hong Kong or Taiwan.\n\nDon't mix the political issues with the trade deal, right?\n\nAnd then is there some degree maybe you can speak to culturally where stylistically there's red lines, meaning don't bully China like language wise, or does that not matter? Because there's a kind of way of speaking in the United States that, you know, I, I feel like in diplomacy in general, neither side wants to be humiliated and in great deals, even when one side on paper wins, you wanna make the other side, especially the side that gets the short end of the stake, feel like they've won and show the rest of the world that they're the winner.\n\nWell, that's diplomacy. That's diplomacy. We have an absence of diplomacy. But you're absolutely right there, there needs to be respect. The Chinese at least really care about respect. And I wish there was a just a bit more cultural fluency. And I think a lot of things would be so much easier between the two countries, just understanding that because you can actually push China to do a lot of things, right? All within reason that would work in favor of the us. But understand that respect is vitally important. Face saving is very, very, very important\n\nTo what degree, what Xi Jinping says and what they're putting out there in the world represents the truth. So he has a whole way of being of like, let's deescalate, let's all make good deals together. Let's almost like, let's be friend like Modi a little bit has a similar way of being like, let's just, and the implied thing is like, forgive the French, but if you fuck with us, we'll won't be nice, but let's just all be nice together. Well, is he speaking the truth? The\n\nXi Jining is not Putin, right? Sure. And there is a genuine desire on China's part to deescalate, again, coming back to the level of pragmatism under economic strain in China, you don't really wanna be picking fights. They don't agree at all with Trump's economic views and world vision, let's just put it simply. So understanding that a lot of this is also driven by American internal politics, which they are aware of, of helps a bit, but there's a genuine desire to take the temperature down with the US even if the weather doesn't fundamentally change.\n\nWhat does a good diplomacy look like here for both sides? What is the best possible on the, just strictly on the economics, on the, on the, on the trade, the terrorists, what's the best possible outcome for the world?\n\nI think that Trump can show to the American consumers that he has gotten some sort of a deal, right? That the Chinese have bought more American goods or promised to buy American goods. And then that American companies can come into China. And then a lot of the previously restricted investment opportunities are now not restricted. And the American banks can make and make money in China. He can say that. And, and I think that that is, that could be part of a really realistic deal that somehow American companies will be better protected through IP protection. And again, that's in China's interest as well. So I don't see a fundamental conflict here. And at the same time, they lower the Tariffs, right?\n\nNot to the rates where they were before, but lower and you don't prohibit trade. And then for China, that would also be success. So you can actually have success for both, both places. But being realistic is, is part of the game\n\nIs Tariffs. Question to you as an economist, is Tariffs a useful, effective tool for global trade?\n\nNo, I think that there is a real problem in global trading system and globalization in general that is not gonna be resolved by Tariffs. We do need to think about more harmony between countries where let's say not one country dominates. And here I would, I I'd push back on China and say, yes, you have amazing companies and competitive companies, but you just can't dominate everything that would not be good for global harmony.",

      "transcript_chunk": "many home runs I was sitting on then.\n\nThat's Jackson himself from the film. Now, he had just completed his senior season of college football, which had gone even better. Dave O'Connor, again,\n\nFootball. His senior year is one of the all time great seasons of a running back in college football. He rushes for nearly 1800 yards. He wins the Heisman Trophy and basically enshrines himself as a legend of college football. Sort of the common wisdom was that Bo will be the number one draft pick in football. He will probably not play baseball at all. And if he does, somebody should pick him in the 20th round or 30th round on a flyer just in case,\n\nRight? You don't wanna waste a pick on a guy who's gonna be playing football, right? So while finishing up his college baseball career, Jackson starts getting courted by NFL teams. The football draft happens before the baseball draft. The number one overall NFL pick is held by the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, who are owned by a man named Hugh Culverhouse. The Bucks have made it clear that they want Bo Jackson.\n\nI was all Gog Ho and I had taken a few trips to visit some teams. My senior year I got the okay to go visit Tampa Bay. Hugh Culverhouse sent his jet to Columbus Airport, drove over, got on the jet, went to Tampa Bay for my visit. It was almost like a college visit when you're a high school senior and you're going to visit a college and they get some of the players to show you around town to show you the night spots, take you to a nice restaurant and entertain you. About four or five days later, I'm back at Auburn getting ready for my baseball game.\n\nAnd I walked out on the field. I have to walk from the athletic department across the parking lot across the street to the baseball field. And as I get to the gate to come around the dugout, coach Baird approaches me. He said, Bo, can I talk to you for a second? I said, sure, coach. He said, let's go. We're behind the dugout. Let's go sit and talk. So we go behind the dugout and I'm thinking that he's gonna tell me, Hey, some big league team wants to sign me. And he said, did you take a trip last week on Hugh cover house's jet to go down to visit Tampa? I said, yes. And the folks checked and said that it was okay.\n\nThey checked with the NC and said that it was okay to do that. He said, well Bo someone, somebody didn't check. And the NTAA has declared you ineligible for any more college sports, so you can't play baseball no more. And I sit there on that ground and I cried like a baby. I cried like a baby.\n\nBo Jackson immediately felt that he'd been wronged. He loved baseball. And even though it looked like he was going to play football professionally, he was distraught about being barred from finishing out his college baseball career. And what's more, he became convinced that Hugh Culverhouse, the Tampa Bay owner, had done this to Beau on purpose\n\nBecause the officials at Tampa Bay told me personally, yes, we checked and they said that it was okay. I think it was all a plot now just to get me ineligible from baseball. 'cause they saw the season that I was having and they thought that they were gonna lose me to baseball. And if we declare an ineligible, then we got it.\n\nNow, we don't know whether the bucks actually meant for this to happen, but it certainly did seem to work out well for them. They were in line to pick Bo Jackson, number one in the NFL draft and pay him so much money that he'd forget about baseball in a heartbeat. It was just one problem. Bo Jackson isn't the forgetting type.\n\nAnd I said, there is no way I'm signing with Tampa Bay. And I told Hugh Cover House, I said, you draft me if you want it, you gonna waste a draft pick. I said, I promise you that. And Hugh cover house. Well, this is what I'm gonna offer you as a signing bonus and you're gonna take it and whether you want it or not. I said, all right. They didn't think I was serious. And I sat down after baseball season was over, I talked to my baseball coach. I said, coach, a lot of people don't think I'm serious about playing baseball. I said, but if Tampa Bay drafts me, I said, on my honor, and I'm looking, you in your eye man to man, I'm playing baseball.\n\nSo if you know any teams out there that's interested in an outfielder, you let 'em know.\n\nIn the NFL draft that April Tampa Bay did select Bo Jackson with the number one pick, which was attached to a $7.66 million five, five-year contract. And then a couple of months later, Bo Jackson was selected in the baseball draft in the fourth round by the Kansas City Royals. They offered him three years, years at just $1 million. The choice would seem obvious, but Bo doesn't know obvious. He rejects a football offer and he takes the baseball offer. How surprising is this? Here's Dave O'Connor again,\n\nUnprecedented. It just doesn't happen. You, you can't, I mean, money talks, right? I mean you, you have $7.6 million sitting there and you sign a contract for one. That's a rare occurrence.\n\nIt sounds like a decision that very few people that I know at least would've made. Do you think that was an act of spite on Bo Jackson's part?\n\nIt's interesting because I think Bo would say that he did the honorable thing and that he has a code. But when you look at it on its surface, it is spite. There is no rational explanation for walking away from that kind of money. He's not just hurting himself here. He's also doing this to hurt Tampa Bay. To some extent, the opportunity cost of losing a first round draft pick isn't just that Bo Jackson isn't playing on my team. It's that every other player I could have selected with that pick is not playing on my team either. So it's a huge impact to Tampa Bay, not to mention the public relations nightmare of of going out on a limb and selecting somebody and not getting him.\n\nSo Jackson does sign with the Royals. He starts the year in the minor leagues, but by the end of the season he makes a major league team. He's on track for a nice baseball career, and then the next year he becomes eligible to reenter football. Now will he play? Nobody knows. But the Los Angeles Raiders draft him in the seventh round. He signs and suddenly he's playing two professional sports. At the end of the baseball season, he jumps straight into football and he became a star in both. He also becomes a household name in part because of his athletic feats. And in part because he was the star of one of the most beguiling ad campaigns in history.\n\nBo knows for Nike,\n\nBo knows baseball. Bo knows football. Bo knows basketball too.\n\nBo could surf. Bo could roller Blade Bo could not play ice hockey. That was the one thing that they couldn't, they they couldn't agree to let him actually be able to do. Gretzky shakes his head and says\n\nNo,\n\nBut pretty much everything else, volleyball, tennis, running, lifting, weights, aerobics, all kinds of stuff.\n\nBo, you don't know Didley.\n\nAlright, so we agree that Bo Jackson's athletic career turned out pretty well, remarkable on some dimensions, but overall not one of the greatest ever because it wasn't long enough. Perhaps we agree that because he was such an unusual athlete into sports, he became this icon and the focus of a remarkable and probably quite remunerative ad campaign, right? We agree on this so far. Yes. Do we therefore agree that had this catastrophe not happened with him, with getting drafted for the NFL by a team that out of spite or something like spite he turned down that if that had not happened, that all the rest may not have happened?\n\nYeah, I think that's a plausible argument to make because he probably had, he signed that deal with Tampa Bay, if he doesn't get injured, he probably becomes one of the best running backs in NFL history. But that's probably\n\nIt. I mean, honestly, my takeaway lesson here is spite pays.\n\nYeah, you would say, I mean if you take a look at where he ends up despite certainly paid in his case.\n\nSo here's a question we're thinking about. If spite indeed exists, is it something that we humans have always carried around in our genetic code? Or do we pick it up along the way?\n\nWe are constantly wrestling with our conscience and with a tendency to deviate from social norms in a risky way and to do wrong, to be selfish.\n\nThat's coming up after the break.

So is spite an innate part of being human or is it something we learn?\n\nWe're a very biological organism and we've inherited an awful lot. In fact, most of the basic emotions that guide us from our animal and paleolithic early human past\n\nThat is EO Wilson. He's a renowned biologist and author\n\nAnd that's Katherine Wells. She produced this episode and she interviewed EO Wilson for us back in 2013.\n\nI called him up because I wanted to know where all of this self-destructive spite comes from. You know, is this a common behavior throughout nature or are we unusual in it? And I have to say that I just assumed that we would be the meanest creatures in existence given everything we've heard today. But Wilson said that wasn't true.\n\nOh no, we only moderately mean.\n\nNow Eel Wilson has done a lot of thinking about the origins of human behavior and he thinks the nastiness that we see in animals might give us a clue to why we act the way we do.\n\nThere's a case that comes quickly to mind, for example, of a kind of spider in which the mother has a brood of spider lings and when they're born she sits down and, and lets the little spiralling eat her. There are a couple of cases in the ants where the workers have a huge gland of poisonous material containing it, and when they get into a tough fight, they are able to contract their abdomens and explode their abdomen so that the sticky poison covers the enemy. It can disable several enemies doing that by giving its life.\n\nThe list of this kind of behavior goes on and on.\n\nI mean things that you really don't want to think about too much before you go to sleep. You might have nightmares, but here's the story about spite. If we define spite as doing harm to someone else at the cost of harm to yourself, and that involves a surrender of some advantage or emotional reward on your part, you give it up in order to hurt somebody else that might not exist\n\nIn nature.\n\nIt's very difficult to find any case in the great encyclopedia of animal aggression where it doesn't give some advantage to the individual doing the aggression. But it's very rare that an animal would deliberately injure itself just in order to create injure in another individual without any further gain to itself. To deliberately do that, I think spite does not exist in the animal kingdom\n\nIn the way that it does in humans. Is that right?\n\nWell, let's take humans. When a person injures himself or herself, say in reputation, in diminishing wealth, causing their own early death, whatever it is, in order to harm another person, he would say, oh, that's spite. That's got to be spite. But it really would be true spite in my mind as opposed to mirror risk taking or trade off for one kind of gain in exchange for one kind of loss taken. If you can't see a gain, and that's hard to imagine, even vengeance has its gain.\n\nIt has a strong emotional award to it. For example, if you harm yourself in your reputation, you accept that if the damage you can do benefits you in some other way or benefits, say particularly your own offspring in a particular way, you know, like unscrupulous stage moms murderous of cheerleading champion competitors. I think you'll get the drift. Even a mass murderer who goes out and harms a lot of people is taking some benefit, emotional benefit from that when suicide is intended.\n\nA lot of mass murders are just a terrible form of suicide in which a person decides to get the satisfaction is vast of committing it, and maybe the satisfaction the person will get in striking out against something they imagine to be their enemy and diminish them before. So when you add that factor, maybe real spite does not exist.\n\nSo I don't know whether this is a relief or not. I mean, the idea that spite might not even exist seems good, but the fact that we get personal satisfaction out of hurting other people. I told Wilson that was kind of a bummer.\n\nThat just shows you're not a psychopath.\n\nI'm, I'm a, I'm a total woos. But here's the upside. Spite is not the only motivation we have for being self-destructive. There's actually another altruism. When we hurt ourselves, we aren't always doing it just to hurt someone else. Sometimes we're doing it to help.\n\nOne of the things that makes us human is our internally conflicted nature confliction our ambivalence to our own selves. We are constantly wrestling with our conscience and with a tendency to deviate from social norms in a risky way and to do wrong, to be selfish. The contest within us between doing the moral thing, even the heroic thing on one side and doing the selfish, perhaps even criminal thing on the other side, that contest is what gives us such a continuously conflicted nature.\n\nIf we became completely altruistic, then we would be like ants. If we went to the opposite extreme and had complete lack of constraint and it was complete individualism, then we would have chaos. We would not have order. The group would dissolve. So we have to be in the middle. This appears to be the human condition.\n\nIt's funny listening to him talk about that.\n\nThat's Steve Levitt again. He took a class with Wilson when he, Levitt was an undergrad at Harvard. He's very fond of the way Wilson thinks.\n\nThere could be no two disciplines closer than evolutionary biology and economics. And they studied different questions and they use different methods. But the way that evolutionary biologists thinks is exactly like the way that economists think. Both are very much a model of behavior, of individual behavior, an individual behavior that's motivated by costs and benefits. The other thing is that at its heart, both economics and evolutionary biology strive for simplicity. That the simplest story which can explain a set of facts is the one that we gravitate to as opposed to other disciplines. History history's all about complexity. Literature is all about complexity.\n\nEven sociology, I think at heart is about complexity.",

      "transcript_chunk": "ack on all of us.\n\nThat was really smart, and it produced with all of the incredible imperfections, nonetheless, 80 extraordinary years of progress.\n\nWhen you talk about enlightened self-interest, it makes me think of, there was a, a Nobel Prize speech given by Bertrand Russell, the British philosopher. This was in 1950. He talked about there were four drivers, four key drivers of all human action. They are acquisitiveness, rivalry, vanity and love of power. Nowhere on that list is enlightened self-interest. Yeah, so I guess I'm getting to a a more basic or philosophical question, which has to do with the nature of humankind, and this also might connect us to a conversation about the famous Francis Fukuyama argument about the end of history, which basically declared that democracy has won, and in the decades since then, we've seen obviously a return to a political style in many countries that looks much more like the might is right argument versus the enlightened self-interest model.\n\nDo, do you feel then that you and I and many others had the fortune to be born into that period where there was a relative moderation, but that now we're returning to the natural state of punching each other in the nose and taking what we can?\n\nYes, but the notion that, you know, life is nasty, brutish, and short has real salience. It may be, and there's one theory of history that the natural state of things is not what we experienced broadly speaking over the last 80 years. That nasty brutish in short is more the norm, that poverty is more the norm than productivity and progress, and that it is only through exceptional decisions and endeavors that we can break out of the norm.\n\nDo you buy that argument or are you saying, no, we superseded it?\n\nNo, I, I guess I see it differently, and I think looking at the extraordinary sweep of history, it does seem to me that we've been on an arc of progress, albeit one that sometimes bends in the wrong direction and occasionally breaks. The question is whether that arc can continue and we can try to make sure that when it's under incredible strain as it will be in this period, it doesn't break.\n\nI'm guessing, you know the work of scholars, Tom Shelling and others Yeah, who've argued over the years that for many, many, many generations, civilization really was built around competition and conflict, right? There weren't many resources, so you fought over them, but then we've entered a period where we know how to make stuff at scale. We know how to grow food at scale, and so you would think that we would've transitioned over into a period of collaboration and cooperation versus competition and so on, but it feels to me as if we've retreated from that.\n\nI don't think this is zero sum choice. Competition's a good thing. It's the basis of our system. It's a driver of progress, I think done right, done fairly. It tends to bring out the best in people. Certainly, I think that's been the experience in the United States, so I don't see it as being detrimental or undermining of collaboration, cooperation, and non-zero sum outcomes. On the contrary, yes, you've gotta have often individual ingenuity and innovation, but so many of these things to be successful are collective enterprises. For example, I was talking about the extraordinary engine for innovation and progress that the United States has been since the end of World War ii.\n\nAt the start of the 20th century, there was no branch of science in which the United States led the world. Hmm. At the start of the 21st century, there was no branch of science in which the United States did not lead the world. How did that happen? I think it happened because some profoundly smart decisions were made about the country and how it should operate mostly after the Second World War. Maybe the most important among them was this extraordinary public private partnership between the government, private sector, and especially our universities. By about a year ago, we had something like 3.5% of our GDP that was dedicated to research and development, a trillion dollars a year, 40% of that coming from the federal government and much of that going to universities to make these advances.\n\nWe've managed to be this extraordinary pole of attraction for the most talented people in the world who come here, think here, invent here, create here, and many stay here, which is what we want. I was really struck by something the other day. You saw that Mark Zuckerberg went on this extraordinary, what do you call it?\n\nHiring spree,\n\nBuying spree, hiring spree to find the best possible talent for ai. He wound up bringing in 11 extraordinary talents. I was kind of curious about it because I saw their names and it really jumps out at you. It's not John Smith, the 11 people. They're from China, they're from India, they're from the uk, they're from South Africa, they're from Australia. Each one of them an immigrant to this country. Each one of them, I believe, came here to pursue academic studies, research work, and now they are in the vanguard of what in a positive sense, is going to carry our society and our civilization forward.\n\nThat is AI for good, but if we wind up in a place where that talent no longer comes here because it can't or doesn't want to, what are we going to be condemning ourselves to\n\nComing up after the break? What are we condemning ourselves to and can a 19th century worldview work in the 21st?

The president never\n\nMet him.\n\nI've not met him. Of course, I know many people who know him and look, I think the President has extraordinary instincts when it comes to the American people, and he taps into that very powerfully. Maybe the most important economy that we have now is the attention economy and his ability to dominate that economy is a source of great strength and great power.\n\nI mean, those are fairly faint praises with which you're damning him in terms of bigger thinking, strategic thinking, political alliances and so on. I know you're too polite to give him a failing grade, but no, I just\n\nHave a very different worldview as I try to understand where President Trump is going and how he sees the world. I think it's an interesting combination of the 19th century and the 1980s. By which I mean this, the president seems to, this is not a secret respect. First and foremost people. He perceives as strong leaders in strong countries, and maybe until very recently, that was Vladimir Putin, Xi Jinping. Maybe it's Erdogan in Turkey, maybe it's the Crown Prince in Saudi Arabia in that worldview, and in the 19th century, remember we had spheres of influence. The big guys, and I mean, guys got to basically run things in their part of the world.\n\nRegional hegemons,\n\nRegional hegemons, and in that view, Russia would be one, and so what it does in its part of the world, including Ukraine, that's its business. China would be another with the exception, and this gets to the 1980s piece of economic and trade issues because I think the president does have a B and his bonnet about that. They get to do whatever they want in their part of the world, which is why I do have concerns about what does this mean for Taiwan? What does it mean for Chinese expansionism in the South China Sea, and we get to do what we want in our part? Maybe that's Greenland. Maybe that's Canada. Maybe that's the Panama Canal. What's interesting about that, Stephen, is that yes, in the 19th century actually having the land, owning the land, dominating the land was important.\n\nThat's no longer the case. That's not necessary. You can cut a deal, you can make an agreement to get the benefits you want without actually having to take over the country or or the land. Just as in Greenland, we've got a really important military base. We have access through trade and commercial relations to whatever raw materials can actually be gotten from there. It's a really difficult climate, so I think there's that view. The 1980s pieces, I, again, coming up in New York, in that period, Japan Inc. The perception that we were being ripped off to use a diplomatic term, taken advantage of, and maybe there's the real estate piece too, which was very zero sum. You're in a deal. You're either a winner or you're a loser. That's very antithetical to the, well I was talking about earlier, enlightened self-interest in the notion that actually, no, you wanna strive for win-wins and that others doing well means actually you can do better.\n\nWhat I worry about is this, yes, others may have to make an accommodation one time around. Maybe they have to give in on something to avoid a tariff, but then what's the likely motivation and instinct going to be? It's going to be instead of figuring out with us how to de-risk from China, it's going to be de-risk from the United States. How do we make sure that we're not in a position where the whims, the material nature of us policy puts us at risk, and that means trying to find ways to work around or away from the United States to ban together. One of the things that we also avoided after World War II was what typically happens when one power emerges dominant over others, which is everyone else gets together.\n\nThey bandwagon to try to hold it in check because of enlightened self-interest, because we tried to create a rules-based order, however, imperfectly where we bound ourselves again, imperfectly to the same rules as others, we constrained our own power. We avoided what usually happens that bandwagoning, I'm afraid now we're actually going to see that if we continue on on this course.\n\nOn the other hand, all of a sudden NATO seems to be quite fond of Donald Trump, at least. You know, as of this conversation a few weeks ago, there was that amazing press conference, which I'm guessing you saw then the, the statement from Mark Ruta, and it seems as though, I mean, my reading of that, and I'm probably wrong, so I'd love you to tell me, but it seems as though Trump, by making himself the least bad of the strong men, has made himself appealing to the European NATO community. What do you see there?\n\nLet's put this in perspective first. There's this whole question of, you know, are our allies spending enough on defense? The president complained a lot during his first term about free riders and how we're picking up all of the, the burden. There was a kernel of truth to that, to state the obvious, but here's the reality. Back in 2014, all of the NATO countries came together at one of their summits in Wales and they said, we're all gonna spend 2% of GDP on defense. That was the mark that they set for themselves. When President Trump left office, a grand total of nine of our allies were spending the 2% of GDP.\n\nOut of how many?\n\nOut of, at that point, 30, by the time President Biden left office, 23 of the allies were spending 2%. So pretty big difference between the nine at the end of Trump won and the 23 at the end of Biden. I think this is very positive. The agreement that came out of that summit was that all allies agreed that the goal would now be to spend 5% of GDP on defense, which is a pretty extraordinary number. We spend about 3.5%, but I have to say, if I really want to give credit to anyone, it's less President Trump or less, for that matter, president Biden, than it is President Putin.\n\nYes, a dark way of looking at the accomplishment, but I understand now, Donald Trump has been discussed as a potential winner of the Nobel Peace Prize. I'm guessing you've read about that somewhere. I'm curious how much Biden thought about winning the Nobel Peace Prize?\n\nI never heard him talk about it. I don't think that was, at least to my knowledge, what motivated him.\n\nYou think it's in the back of the mind of any president?\n\nOh, I I, I, look, I imagine it is. It's just as I think about it, I can't remember hearing him talk about it, so that doesn't mean it wasn't there.\n\nNow, you were in the Obama White House when Obama won the Peace Prize in 2009, which was his first year in office, and a lot of people thought it was, you know, kind of nuts.\n\nOh, I think President Obama was probably first among them. I think he recognized that this was, in a sense, a triumph of hope,\n\nA down payment, maybe.\n\nMaybe a down payment, what could be, what people hope would be, and I think his speech, which is remarkable, reflected that I'd urge people to go back and and read it. I think it actually does a very good job of grappling with the world as it is, including what we were talking about a little bit earlier, what is the actual state of nature and how do we think about that? But no, I think he recognized that it was, yes, as you would say, a down payment.\n\nI wanna ask about a lunch you had with President Biden a few weeks after his debate with Trump. This was his disastrous debate, which ultimately led to his deciding not to run, but with a lot of chaos. In the interim. What I've read is that at this lunch, you said to him, look, everybody gets remembered in one sentence, and it sounded as if, from what I've read, that you were cautioning him. You don't want your sentence to be old man becomes senile while sitting in the White House. I want you to walk us through that. I want you to give us the most thorough assessment possible of the decline and fall of Joe Biden while understanding that you had long experience and great loyalty and great affection and admiration for him.\n\nYou were among the closest to him. You were among the few who toured, the end was still getting his prime hours.\n\nSo first, the conversations we had, the exchanges we had, those are things that I try to keep to my myself. I've seen some of these accounts, and I don't wanna say much more than that. Here's what I can say, and I'll give you my best judgment first, when it comes to how to evaluate the president, his tenure, what he did and how he did it, I think it's actually pretty simple. Look at the policies the administration pursued. Look at what we did, and then be the judge. You may like it or you may not like it, but the reason I say that is every single one of those decisions and of those judgments was his, not me, not some other cabinet secretary, not some senior advisor.\n\nHis, and I can tell you from my own experience at least, but when it comes to foreign policy, this is where, of course, I was engaged with him on everything that we did. We had the most robust of debates, discussions, arguments that he drove.\n\nLet me ask you this.",

      "transcript_chunk": "sion. That always sat wrong with me. But it wasn't until we launched Hay in 2001 that I saw the full extent of the rot that has snug into Apple's apple\n\nFor people who don't know and we'll talk about it. Hey is this amazing email sort of attempt to solve the email problem?\n\nYes. I like to pitch it as what Gmail would've been with 20 years of lessons applied in a way where they could actually ship. Gmail was incredible when launch in 2004 and it still is a great product but it's also trapped in its initial success. You can't redesign Gmail today, it just has way too many users. So if you want fresh thinking on email, I wanted fresh thinking on email. I needed to build my own email system and not just my own email client. That's what a lot of people have done over the years. They build a client for Gmail but you're severely constrained if you don't control the email server as well. If you really wanna move the ball forward with email, you have to control both the server and the client.\n\nAnd that was the audacious mission we set out to do with Hey. And that was what's funny, I thought our main obstacle here would be Gmail, it's the 800 pound gorilla in the email space. Something like 70% of all email in the US is sent through Gmail. I think their world rates are probably in that neighborhood as well. They're just absolutely huge and trying to attack an enormous established competitor like that who's so actually still loved by plenty of people and is free seems like a suicide mission. And it was only a mission we signed up for because we had grown ambitious enough after making base camp for 20 years that we thought we could tackle that problem.\n\nSo I thought, hey this is dumb. I would not advise anyone to go head to head with Gmail. That seems like a suicide mission. We're gonna try anyway because you know what, if we fail it's gonna be fine. We're just gonna build a better email experience for me and Jason and the people at the company and our cat and that'll be okay 'cause we're gonna afford to do so. But when we got ready to launch, after spending two years building this product, millions of dollars in investment to it. We obviously needed mobile apps. You're not gonna be a serious contender with email if you're not on a mobile phone and you need to be there with a native client. So we had built a great native client for both iOS and for Android and as we were getting ready to launch, we submitted both of them to the app stores, got both of them approved on I think Friday afternoon for the iOS app and we then went live on Monday and we were so excited.\n\nHey world, we've been working on this new thing, I'd love for you to check it out. And of course as with anything, when you launch a new product, there are some bugs. So we quickly found a few in the iOS client and submitted a new build to Apple. Hey here's our bug fix, can you please update? And that's when on Help broke loose. Not only were they not gonna prove our update, they said, oh wait a minute, we gave you permission to be in the app store, but I'm sorry that was a mistake. We see that you're not using our in-app payment system, which means that we don't get 30% of your business. You'll have to rectify that or you can't be in the app store.\n\nAnd first I thought like, well it got approved already. We're running on the same model. We've run Basecamp on in the app store for a decade. If you're not signing up through the app and we're signing up our own customers on our own website and they're just going to the app store to download their companion app, we're gonna be fine. That was the truth, right? That was why I never got so fired up about the app store. Even as Apple started tightening the screws was like my business was okay now suddenly my business wasn't okay. Apple was willing to destroy hay if we did not agree to give them 30% of all the signups that came through the iOS app. And it wasn't just about the 30%, it was also about splitting and not longer having a direct relationship with our customers.\n\nWhen you sell an app in the app store, you're not selling an app to a customer. You're selling an app to inventory at Apple and then Apple sells an app to that customer. That customer has a purchasing relationship with Apple. So if you wanna give discounts or refunds or whatever, it's complete hell if you want to easily support multi-platform that's complete. Hell if someone signs up for hey on their iPhone and they wanna switch to Android. But that billing relationship, it's tied to Apple, it's complete hell for a million reasons. I did not want to hand my business over to Apple. I did not wanna hand 30% of our revenue over to Apple. So we decided to do something that seemingly Apple had never heard before.\n\nWe said no, we're not gonna add the in-app payment. I don't care if you're threatening us this, this is not fair, this is not reasonable, please approve. And of course they didn't and it escalated and after a couple of days we realized, you know what? This isn't a mistake. This isn't going away. We're gonna be dead if they go through with this, if we're not gonna yield and give them the 30%, they're gonna kick us off unless we make such a racket such noise that they will regret it. And that's exactly what then happened.\n\nWe were blessed by the fact that we launched, hey one week before the WW DC, their worldwide developer conference where Apple loves to get up on stage and harp on how much they do for developers, how much they love them and why you should bill for their new devices and so on and so forth. And then we also just happened to have a platform on the internet, which is very convenient when you need to Go to war with a $3 trillion company. So I started kicking and screaming oh boy. And essentially turning it up to 11 in terms of the fight and going public with our or denial to be in the app store. And that turned into a prolonged two week battle with Apple that essentially ended in the best possible outcome we could have gotten as David fighting Goliath, which was a bit of a truce.\n\nWe wouldn't hand 30% over to Apple. They do wouldn't kick us out of the app store, but we had to build some bullshit dummy account such that the app did something when you downloaded it. That was a rule that Phil Schillers seemingly made up on the fly when pressed for the fifth time by the media about why we couldn't be in the app store when a million other companion apps could. But we just happened to be able to create so much pain and noise for Apple that it was easier for them to just let us be than to keep on fighting. What\n\nDo you think about Tim Sweeney's victory with Epic over Apple?\n\nI think it is incredible and the entire developer ecosystem, not just on iOS but on Android as well, O Epic, Tim Sweeney and Mark Rain, an enormous debt of gratitude for taking on the only battle that has ever inflicted a series wound on Apple in this entire sorted campaign of monopoly enforcement. And that is Epic's fight versus them. Tim recently revealed that it has cost well over a hundred million dollars in legal fees to carry on this battle against Apple. We for a hot moment, considered suing Apple when they were threatening to kick us out.\n\nWe shopped the case around with a few law firms and perhaps of course they would tell us you have a good case. I mean they're trying to sell a a product here, but they would also tell us it's gonna cost a minimum of $10 million and it's gonna take five to seven years through all the appeals. Now we now learned the actual price tag was 10 times higher, right? Epic spend over a hundred million. It would've destroyed us to take on Apple in the legal realm. Only a company like Epic could do it and only a company run by founders like Tim, like Mark could risk the business in the way that they did the audacity they had to provoke the fight in the first place, which I thought was just incredible.\n\nAnd to stick with it for the long term, no board would've signed off on this lawsuit to a professional CEO, no freaking way. So the fact that they've been able to beat Apple in also the most hilarious way possible, I think it's just incredible. 'cause remember their first victory in the case was actually not much of a victory. There were about 11 counts in the trial. Apple basically won 10 of them. And the judge awarded Epic this one little win that Apple couldn't tell him not to link up to the internet to be able to do the payment processing.\n\nSo they want this one little thing and Apple, instead of just taking the 10 out of 11 wins and going fine, you can have your little LINKS, but all these other rules stay in place decided to essentially commit criminal contempt of court as they've now been referred to for prosecution and angered the judge to such a degree that the rule of law in the US now is that you can launch an app in the app store and you don't have to use in-app payment, but you can have a direct billing relationship with a customer if you just link out to the open internet when you take the credit card and then hop back into the app. And we owe all of that to Tim and Mark.\n\nWe owe all of that to Epic. We're gonna launch new apps any minute now, I hope actually. And next week to take advantage of this that revamp the hey apps such that people who download the Hey app off the Apple app store can sign up in the app and can then use the web to put in their credit card so we don't have to pay 30%. Instead we have a direct billing relationship and such that they can take that subscription to Android, to PCs, whatever without any hassle. And we have Tim and Mark to thank for it.\n\nYeah, Tim, I mean the, like you said founders but also specific kind of founders. 'cause I think may, maybe you can educate me on this, but Tim is somebody who maintains to this day sort of the unreasonableness of principles. Yes.\n\nThat's what I love.\n\nI I think sometimes maybe even with founders you can get worn down. It's a large company. Yes, there's a lot of smart quote unquote people around you lawyers and just whispering your ear over time and you're like, well just be reasonable being a, you know, this is a different thing and to to be the sort of maintain, I mean Steve Jobs did this, is it maintain, make still are the asshole? Yes. Who says no? Yes this whole company, I'll sink this whole fucking company over this.\n\nThat's the exact language basically I used in our original campaign. I will burn this business down before I hand over 30% of it to Apple. And that sort of indignation, that actual rage is something I try to be a little careful about tapping into because it is a little bit of a volatile compound because I mean I have a bunch of employees, we have a bunch of com customers. It would be pretty sad if the journey of 37 signals after 25 years would come to an end because Apple would burn us down or I would burn the business down over this fight with Apple. But I think you also need that level of conviction to be able to even drive the day-to-day decisions. One of the other Apple examples, and I know we're racking on Apple a little bit here and I don't actually hate them, I really don't.\n\nI'm tremendously disappointed at the squandered relationship that did not need to be sold away for so little. Now I understand that the app store toll booth is actually a pretty big business. It's multiple billions, but Apple is a trillion dollar company. And I think in the lens of history, this is gonna come off as a tremendous mistake and I think it's already coming off as a tremendous mistake. The flop that was the Vision Pro was partly because Apple had pissed off every other developer. No one was eager to come build the kind of experiences for their new hardware that would perhaps have made it a success. So when you're on top and you have all the cards, you can dilute yourself into thinking that you can dictate all terms at all times and there are no long-term consequences.\n\nApple is learning finally the fact that there are long-term consequences and that developers actually are important to Apple's business. And the relationship is not entirely one sided. We don't owe our existence to Apple and Apple alone. We've built our own customer bases. Apple has been beneficial to the industry. I'm glad the iPhone exists, da da da da. It's not that it doesn't go both ways, but Apple wants it only one way. And I think that is a mistake and it's a mistake that was avoidable and a that's disappointing, certainly disappointing for me. I've literally spent 20 years evangelizing this shit, right? I've spent so much money buying Apple hardware, excusing a bunch of things they've done over the years.\n\nAnd then for what? For the fact that you wanted 30% of something that I created in the most unreasonable way possible. Couldn't we have found a better way to do this? I think they're going to get forced to, to do a better way. But did you also have to go through the indignity of having a criminal contempt charge against you getting referred to prosecution? It just seems so beneath Apple, but it also seems so in line with what happens to huge companies who are run by quote unquote professional managers rather than founders and unreasonable people.\n\nWell we should probably also say that the thing you love about Apple, the great spirit of Apple I think still persists and there's a case to be made that this 30% things a slice, a particular slice of a company, not a defining aspect of the company and that it Apple is still on top in the, in the hardware that it makes and a lot of things that it makes. And you know this is, that could be just a hiccup in a long story of a great company that does a lot of awesome stuff for humanity. So like Apple's a truly special company we, me we mentioned Amazon, there's no company like Apple.\n\nI agree. This is why the disappointment is all greater because we had such high aspirations and expectations to Apple that they were the shining city on the hill and they were guiding the industry in a million positive ways. Ways I think as we talked about earlier, hardware is exciting again in large part because Apple bought PA semi and pursued a against all odds mission to get arm up to the level it is today. And we have these incredible M chips now because of it. And the design sensibilities that Apple bring to the table are unparalleled.\n\nNo one has taste certainly at the hardware level like Apple does, even at the software level. I'd say there's a lot of taste left in Apple, but there's also some real sour taste now. So they have to wash that off first I think before they find their way back. But Apple's been in a, in a mirage before, I mean Wasniak and Steve Jobs started this thing in the garage, has great success with the Apple ii. He hands the company over to a sugar drink salesman who tanks the company into the nineties. He doesn't learn the lesson, spends the next 20 years building up this amazing company, then hands the company over again to a logistics person who presumably had more redeeming qualities than the first guy who put in charge but still ends up leading the company astray.\n\nNow this is the norm. The norm is that great companies don't last forever in the long arc of history. Almost no company lasts forever. There are very few companies around that was here a hundred years ago, even fewer 200 years ago. And virtually nothing that are a thousand years old outside of a handful of Japanese sorts makers or something like that, right? So you can get diluted into thinking that something is forever when you're in the moment. And they seem so large. Apple could absolutely stumble and I think they have more reason to stumble now than ever. They're behind on ai, terribly behind their software quality is faltering in a bunch of ways.\n\nThe competition is catching up on the hardware game in part because TSMC is not an Apple subsidiary, but a foundry that services a MD and Nvidia and others who are now able to use the same kind of advanced processes.",

      "transcript_chunk": "ng or forcibly directing these countless actions, which bring me into being.\n\nIn other words, none of the millions of people involved directly or indirectly in making a pencil cared one bit about making a pencil, maybe didn't even know what they were making.\n\nNot one of them is motivated by making a pencil. They're motivated by earning money, providing for their family. And the astounding thing as Leonard Reed says, is the absence of a mastermind. There is no one dictating or forcibly directing these countless actions as he put it.\n\nSo the deeper conclusion of eye pencil is that a well-oiled free market can create something that even an alchemist wouldn't dream of. Now, this may not be the way you see free market capitalism, and let's be honest, there are market failures. There are segments of the economy that seems stacked against small players or are too susceptible to self-dealing or corruption. But the point is that free market capitalism is better than all the known alternatives. Now, let's keep in mind that Leonard Reed writing in 1958 and even Milton Friedman speaking in 1980 were responding to a different political climate. They were both concerned about the legacy of Roosevelt's new deal programs and the growing involvement of the government in American economic life.\n\nThey were also concerned about communism and what they saw as the tyranny of state run economies in places like the Soviet Union. Just listen to the pencil.\n\nIf you can become aware of the miraculousness, which I symbolize you can help save the freedom mankind is so unhappily losing\n\nThe freedom. Mankind is so unhappily losing Reed sounds worried, worried that the US government and others like it were disastrously veering to the left, that the government wanted to get more involved in running things. And the governments don't always do such a great job of running things, especially when it comes to the economy. So really the deep, deep conclusion of eye pencil is, Hey, US government, get out of the way.\n\nLeave all creative energies, uninhibited, merely organize society to act in harmony with this lesson. Let society's legal apparatus remove all obstacles the best it can. Permit these creative know-hows freely to flow. Have faith that free men and women will respond to the invisible hand.\n\nDoes Leonard Reed's essay sound like libertarian propaganda? Of course it does. That's what it was to some degree. So if you don't lean that way, you may not buy its message. There's also an argument to be made as some people have made that the pencil conveniently omitted some important facts from its autobiography. Like all the goods and services the government provides that help directly or indirectly in the pencils manufacture and sail the roads that move the lumber and other materials, the public schools that educated the loggers and the mill workers, the same schools that at least in 1958 would've ordered thousands upon thousands of pencils for their students.\n\nAnd then there are the less tangible things like a legal system to uphold contracts and the protections provided by police and the courts. Here again is the economist Tim Hartford.\n\nClearly, in a modern economy, a tremendous amount of the infrastructure that we rely on has been paid for by taxpayers and coordinated in some way by state government, local government, or by the federal government. Some of these things could be provided privately, but as a matter of fact, they are provided by government and they seem to be provided reasonably well.\n\nSo if your takeaway from I pencil is that governments should get completely added away,\n\nI think that's an extreme reading. It's not impossible to read it that way, but you are really pushing it. If you are reading, however, is the free market can do a lot. It does amazing things and government should be careful before it sort of stamps. Its great big boots all over free market process. Then I think that that's a fair reading and I think that's a wise warning.\n\nIt is a warning that Hartford says is worth heeding, especially as we are collectively thinking about how to deal with things like climate change, income inequality, the stability of our financial system.\n\nSo there are all kinds of areas of the global economy where you could say, I'm not happy with what the free market is giving me. The lesson I draw from the story of high pencil is when you try to fix those problems, be humble, be careful because they're far more complicated than you could possibly imagine. And any fix to, for example, the energy system is going to involve far more people and far more countries and far more technologies than you could imagine. Now, that doesn't mean that you should just leave the market to do everything, but it does suggest a particular way of solving problems.\n\nAnd I guess in addition to requiring input from a lot of other people because of the complexity, it also implies that you may indeed quote, solve one part of the problem. But that solution may indeed ripple up and turn into a bigger problem in another realm that you may not care about. But that actually does affect a lot of people. I mean, some kind of unintended consequence, I guess. Yes.\n\nSo yes, one lesson is that there will always be unintended consequences whenever you start messing around with a complex system. I think another lesson is that trial and error is a really important process. This is the lesson I draw in my book, adapt. You need to carry out lots of experiments and you need to create a system that allows lots of experiments. So the free market system is an experimental system, but it's not the only experimental system. If you're gonna start messing with global supply chains, with the energy system, with a financial system, you wanna make things work better, you are gonna need to do that step by step, constantly gathering data about what's working and what's not, and running really good experiments.\n\nAnd I think where Leonard Reed was absolutely right was to suggest that when the free market works well, it delivers amazing results. Well, why does it deliver amazing results? One reason is because there's lots and lots of small experiments and lots and lots of small failures. There were pencil manufacturers or lumberjacks or coffee companies or truck companies making bad decisions and going bankrupt all the time. But the system as a whole is resilient and stable and creative. As Leonard Reed rightly pointed out, it produces miracles\n\nAnd some of those miracles are produced here.\n\nOkay, here we go. Jim Weissenborn. I'm a fourth generation pencil maker and we're in Jersey City, New Jersey at the home of general pencil company.\n\nGeneral Pencil was incorporated in the late 19th century.\n\nWe've been In this location since 1917.\n\nWhen we spoke with Weissenborn back in 2015, he was the boss at General Pencil. He's now mostly retired, but he still helps some of the younger members of the Weissenborn family run the company. General Pencil is one of the last few remaining pencil factories in the United States.\n\nYou're gonna see probably something that's not available any place in the world. It's a total production of a pencil from the very rawest materials to the finished product we even do or own marketing. It's a kind of fun. There\n\nAre only a handful of American pencil factories left. Sometimes when one shut down, Weissenborn would buy their old machinery and store it away for spare parts.\n\nI'm gonna take you in the way the, from the very beginning of the process. Okay? All right, sounds good. We're going down. Graphite\n\nWeissenborn led our producer Christopher Wirth on a tour. It began by walking down a steep set of stairs into the factory's basement where giant metal barrels were churning up a mixture of graphite and clay. These\n\nBarrels are the secret to our product. These are tumbling barrels they used in Germany a hundred years ago. We've never changed this process. And what you hear going around in there are Belgium stones off the coast of Belgium, and they pulverize the graphite clay into a topum. Go fine. And that's where your pencils become smooth.\n\nThat fine mixture is then dried ground up again, mixed with water. Then it's extruded through a machine that makes pencil LEDs that at this point look like long strands of soft gray spaghetti. Those are then dried again and fired in kilns at around 1800 degrees Fahrenheit.\n\nThis is the traditional way of making, if you run through a pencil factory a hundred years ago in Germany, this is what you'd see. I mean, you're in a time war.\n\nThe tour heads into the wood shop.\n\nThat's great stuff, huh? Yeah.\n\nA machine is cutting a row of tiny grooves into the thin, rectangular wooden slats. This is how the lead gets into the pencil. A lead is laid into each of the grooves, and then another grooved wooden slat is glued on top.\n\nThese are number two HB plates coming down. The slats, the bonding processes that the glue goes to. The bottom one, they're flipped over, make a sandwich.\n\nMost of the wood that general pencil uses is California cedar, just like in eye pencil. So some things have stayed the same, but a lot has changed. Also.\n\nThe old days, 80% of we made were yellow pencils. We had all the contracts of yellow unified school districts in Seattle school districts in state of New York. We were running truckload of truckload of pencils outta here. I have all the kids, my wife working in here. This is back 40 years ago.\n\nBut today, those standard yellow pencils Weissenborn says, are made so cheaply elsewhere, primarily in China that it's impossible to compete. General pencil solution was to start making smaller batches of specialized higher quality products, drawing pencils and coloring pencils, things like that. All told there are 117 steps in making a pencil In this factory. And Jim Weissenborn knows every single one. So what does he think of the pencil's argument in eye pencil?\n\nYou know, romantically, that's a nice story. No one makes a pencil. I think we make a pencil,\n\nBut weissenborn admits he's never even been to a graphite mine or a clay mine. He doesn't cut down the cedars out west, which means Leonard Reed was right. Doesn't it?\n\nSimple yet, not a single person on the face of this earth knows how to make me\n\nNot a single person. Even the owner of a complete pencil factory really knows how to make an object as seemingly simple as a pencil. Not that most of us would ever want to need to do such a thing, right? That was really Leonard Reed's point, that the miracle of a well-functioning free market is that it provides us with what we want, generally speaking, at a price we can afford at least most of the time. So a kiwi fruit grown in New Zealand or Italy. I can buy that for a dollar in a New York grocery store, even an online grocery store, which delivers to my door. What do you wanna buy? A German made car. A t-shirt made in Indonesia and Bangladesh spun from cotton grown in Mississippi.\n\nYep, you can buy that too. But this does not stop some people from trying to make their own stuff from the ground up.\n\nSo it's a simple everyday product. We British, we love our toast.\n\nIt's coming up after the break.

Edward Jones, member SIPC.\n\nIt could be that by this point in our episode, you are sick of pencils, so it's time to talk about how something else gets made.\n\nYou wouldn't think so, but there is a very interesting modern parallel to Len Reed's eye pencil story\n\nThat again, is the economist and writer Tim Harford.\n\nA few years ago, a London design student called Thomas Twas decided that he was going to build a toaster from scratch,\n\nYou know, mundane electric toaster.\n\nAnd that is Thomas. He wanted to better understand just how finished consumer goods get to them. A toaster seemed like a relatively simple project.\n\nYou know, obviously I use technology every day. It's like amazingly complex. But at source, it came from just a bunch of rocks and sludge, buried in holes in the ground around the world.\n\nSweets now works as a freelance designer, and he teaches at Central St. Martin's, which is part of the University of the Arts. London. His toaster quest began when he was a student at the Royal College of Art.\n\nSo I went and bought a cheapest toaster I could find, because I thought the cheapest toaster will be the simplest to reverse engineer.\n\nAnd this toaster costs about five or $6 at the local store. So it's a simple everyday product. We British, we love our toast.\n\nSweets, took home the toaster and took it apart.\n\nAnd to my dismay, they were kind of 400 individual bits that had been made and then come together into this item whose sole purpose was to make toasting a slice of bread slightly more convenient in the morning.\n\nThose 400 individual bits were made of many different materials.\n\nThere's copper, there's nickel, there's plastic, which is really important 'cause it makes the toaster look good and also means you don't get electrocuted. There's mica, which is a sort of slate like material, and that's what you wrap the heating elements around\n\nAll these different specialized materials. And I was like, oh God. So I'm trying to replicate this entirely myself. Where do I start? So my strategy became to simplify and substitute and pair back to five materials that I thought I could manage and would give me the best toaster I could make. Yeah,\n\nThose five materials were steel, nickel, copper, mica, and plastic. But even with the first material, steel fwe hit a roadblock. The steel making process is incredibly difficult, especially for an art and design student. So he settled on iron, which is somewhat less complicated.\n\nIt turns out Britain's a post-industrial society. We don't have any iron mines anymore, but we have a disused iron mine\n\nSweet's called up an old iron mine in Wales that had been turned into a museum.\n\nBen said, oh, hi, I'm trying to make a toaster. The guy on the other end of the phone was like, yeah, sure, come down. So I jumped on the train and went to Wales to this iron mine.\n\nTurns out when he got there, they'd misunderstood him on the phone.",

      "transcript_chunk": "tics as best as I could. The, as the Declaration of Independence says, with a decent respect to the opinions of mankind that like, so I should assume that you don't agree with me and in good faith.\n\nAnd so how in the hell am I gonna fix that? Like, I'm gonna have to make you accept that I'm not lying to you when I put these things together. If, if when you read that you feel like I I'm trying to get away with something, you're gonna put it down. And so I didn't write it for you to put it down. I think I wrote a thousand page book for you to put it down. I want you to get through all the way to the end going, God dang man. I didn't really realize it was as bad as all of that. So to convince the critics that's that's what is for as opposed to enough already, which I really wrote enough already for my people, my fans, to give to their brother-in-law and their dad and whoever. It's a little bit after the fact. As I said, I was in a real rush to get it done.\n\nSo I don't have the citations. I do have the citations in Fool's Air and about Afghanistan and actually we're working on now me and one of my guys at the institute we're working on putting the footnotes back into enough already Nice. And doing like the ultimate scholar edition with the overkill on the citations there. But I actually, I had footnotes on most of it. I turned them off and I just raced to the end 'cause I was outta money and I was out of time and I just had to go. And so friends of mine rationalize it like, well I think Bill O'Reilly has footnotes in his books. You know, get that thing out there man. And so I did. And, but I did try to write it in a way where I either cite my citations in the prose, or at least I wrote it in a way where it's a very specific claim.\n\nOn November the ninth they held a meeting and these five people were there and this is what they decided. So you can go and Google that. You know what I mean? It's not, it's, it should be specific enough that people can double check me. But, but then, yeah. So why I'm like this, I'm just a Ron Paul Guy and I can't stand being lied to and, and I can't stand all this violence and I wanna live in a free society and the empire's ruining it. And then, and then so why do I write, why am I like that meticulous about it all is I don't want to be caught being wrong. I'll tell you one funny story and then we'll stop. One time I lost an argument about Waco. It was these three people in my cab and the one of 'em was this real jerk and the other two were on his side 'cause it was his friends.\n\nAnd I was arguing with him about everything. But the thing was, he was like the son of a federal cop and he knew their side of the story like down pat and he really knew his stuff. And so even though I was right and he was wrong, he won and they got outta the car going, nah ha screw you, branch Chian boy and whatever. And oh man, that never happened to me again. You know why? Yeah. Because I read like six books about Waco. I already knew more than enough about it. And then I decided that, yeah, no, actually no one's gonna ever beat me in an argument about that ever again. Ever. So you can really thoroughly\n\nArticulate the Yeah. The evidence for your claims.\n\nAnd you're just like, me too dude. When when you read a 300 page book, it tasted what, like if you wanna read this thing, it's not like a chore, but like, oh, I wanna read that you're done a day and a half or two. Like it's easy to do. Once you set that precedent a few times, it's pretty easy to read a thing and jot down some notes and learn something from it and then teach it to somebody else and whatever. Well yeah, listen, welcome to adulthood or whatever. That's what we do. So like that's all it is. It's just that's my only job is compiling reasons to resent these liars and, and why to know better than all their false promises.\n\nYeah. But also you'd be able to, to articulate it\n\nAnd see also I'm a talk radio guy man. Yeah. And I grew up in the radio of Rush Limbaugh. I'm driving for a living in the era of Rush Limbaugh and g Gordon Liddy and all the local guys. And I mean the, I'll go ahead and say this on the record too. The local hosts on KLBJ AM and Austin all suck and always have all of them since Raleigh James in 9 96. Love her. Everybody since then, I mean I don't know who listens to KLBJ am at all, how they even stay in business at all. Their hosts suck.\n\nThe, the, the content of their awards are the actual raw skill of how they talk and what they talk and they\n\nAll of it. And mostly how stupid and wrong and horrible they are about everything. But also just how like meaningless their DR is. Right? You'd be in the middle of the world's worst crisis and they're like, the liberals are trying to take God out of the pledge of Allegiance. It's like, dude, I would prefer that you just shoot me in the face to listen to this for the love of God. Please. Yeah. But anyway, but I, I love the potential there. And in that era before the internet was what it is today, this is the real town square where you can have a host who knows something, you can have a guest who knows something and you can have callers who know a lot more than you think they would, dude. And I remember listening to them talk about like the Texas Homesteading Act that said you weren't allowed to take out a second mortgage on your house or whatever.\n\n'cause it was to protect the little old ladies. And they were debating over whether they should have that law or not. And I remember thinking, wow, all these people know so much about this topic that I've never heard of before. And all of these callers are just so deep on their knowledge of what they know and whether on that issue or so many other things. The first real time I heard Real AM Radio in Austin, I was 16, I was, wait, nah, I might've been old, I might've been 18. No, no, I would've, I was 16. It was, it was, yeah, it was the same year that the Davidians were killed. I was driving my first car down 180 3 and I said, you know, I've lived in Austin my whole life and I've never listened to the AM band. I wonder what it is. And the first thing I hit was KLBJ am And it was Johnny Walker, the great Johnny Walker, the FM rock and roll dj Yeah.\n\nWas self-hosting and his whole thing. He is a great guy, by the way, rip Johnny Walker. But he goes, look, I don't know anything. I'm literally just hosting this show. The guest is this guy a surviving branch Davidian, and we're taking your calls and this hit me like what? There's even a Branch Davidian alive and they have a point of view and you can hear it. And he's live right now and he's talking and people can call in and they can what? Because in my world that I lived in, what you know about the branch of ID Indians is what you read in the Austin America Statesman or what you're told by Ted Koppel and Dan Rather. And that's all you get.\n\nWhat do you mean? Yeah, I can interact with one. Yeah. And then the callers are brilliant. The callers know all, they're not kooks. They know exactly what they're talking about. And they'll be like, I'll tell you what happened was on March the 19th, blah, blah, blah. Oh, okay. So this is why I'm like, this is, this is Talk radio to me is, it's like if you believe in the idea of like any kind of like so-called popular government, like if we have to settle for any sort of stateism at all, you want the people to be able to have one big ass conversation with each other. Right. That's why your show is so important because you get hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of thousands of views and listens, maybe millions if you include all the podcasts.\n\nAnd so for a guy like me, it's like, yeah, it's a chance to talk to a whole bunch of people to get a bunch of people having the same conversation together instead of everybody just all spread out having their own little separate arguments and not interacting with each other. So to me that was the brilliance of talk radio and then where Rush Limbaugh and g Gordon Liddy were all polished and had their little programs. The guys on 5:50 AM in San Antonio, especially Carl Wigglesworth was my favorite. But him and all those guys, even Ricky Ware, who was the John Hae lunatic, but he was still such a sweet guy. And their talk radio, their version of talk radio was,\n\nAll right, call Woolsworth show. Everybody we're talking about Bill Clinton selling cocaine down there with Dan Lasseter and mean Arkansas. And we got Terry Reed on the phone. Tell us about your book Compromise Clinton Bush and the CIA Terry.\n\nBut everybody's kicking back. Yeah. Everybody's got this front porch that's all attitude. And they got all the time in the world. We're here every day for three hours a day, no thing. And we're talking about, and and they're just the nicest guys. Come back from commercial and go, it's Carl, we're talking with Terry about the thing. And no bumper music, no fanfare, no last name. You just jumped, jumped in the middle of a conversation, tune in, figure it out. And it's just beautiful. It's perfect. And then I modeled myself and the way I do my show on beginning on Free Radio Austin in 98 and 99, and then on Chaos Radio, Austin from 2002 through 2010. I guess I was on chaos, although it wasn't, yeah, it was 2010 before they seized our last transmitter from chaos, wasn't it?\n\nI think it was. So yeah, it dropped over 10 years. I did chaos for like yeah. A long time. And then, so that was my whole attitude was, look, I am a regular guy. I ain't gotta fake that. I didn't Go to college, I dropped that at a CC and my message ain't for elite policy makers. My message is for my peers. Look at what they're doing. That's it. And, and this is why the, you know, the Roth Bardy style of libertarian populism really always appealed to me is because that's who it's geared toward. The Cato Institute wants an audience with the Senate, the Mees Institute and the Libertarian Institute, an anti-war dot com. We want an audience with the population of this country, right? That's who we're trying to talk to. That's who we are.\n\nThat's where we come from. We're not Washington DC folk. We're from out here and are, we're speaking in the third person about them, you know, rather trying to be part of the regime.\n\nI I just wanna say briefly that the, you said the people that call in are usually brilliant. And that's the experience I've had. I've recorded a few conversations just on the street. Like I went to the West Bank and I interviewed a bunch of people on the street and I really wanna do that a lot more because I didn't meet a single person who's not brilliant in their own way. Yeah. It's like, it's remarkable. It's remarkable to brilliance that comes from people You ever listen\n\nTo sports radio?\n\nNot, not as much as I probably should.\n\nYeah. Well look, you know what, well, I don't know if this counts anymore, but I spent a little bit of time in Denver, listen to sports radio in Denver. Nice. These people are fanatics, man. But the point being that, you know, Jimmy, the air conditioner repairman is smarter than you dude. Yeah. And he knows everything that every baseball team ever achieved and win. And who and everyone on the teams, all their stats. All their everything and why it mattered and it mattered a lot to them. And the level of expertise there is no different than in your highest applied sciences or history or any other thing. Exactly. You know what I mean? It all just depends on what you're interested in and what you want to know that much about.\n\nAnd this is norm Chomsky's thing that he talked about where, look, if you're a primate that's intelligent enough to speak, then you are a genius. Right? Then you are absolute miracle, unbelievable impossible. You know, circumstance, situation of your very existence. And so we all ought to be taken like at that very level, you know what I mean? Like no matter who you're dealing with there's something special in there, you know?\n\nYeah. And usually it comes with humility because people with PhDs and Harvard and so on, they usually have this overinflated ego that comes from authority, but sports, radio, people on the street everyday, folks. Yeah. They don't have that. And so they could just speak their expertise without the ego.\n\nYeah. Well, and, and that's my thing too, is I don't have nothing to sell yet other than, I mean my coffee sponsor and whatever, but like my, my sincerity is like all I got, I don't have any other argument from authority that I can invoke other than people listen to me. They know I'm not lying and they can tell what my biases are. I wear 'em absolutely on my sleeve. You know what I mean? Is every day I only try to quantify whether I hate Bill Clinton or George W. Bush Moore. And it's, and that's where I'm coming from. And everybody understands that and they know that I never deliberately try to make 'em think one thing instead of another. And if I did, they would obviously catch on to that and then I'd be completely ruined and have to just go get a job delivered auto parts or something.\n\nAnd which would be fine. In fact, I like delivering auto parts. I've had that job before. Although I'd rather drive at night if I gotta drive. I'd rather, I guess drive a Uber at night. But\n\nIf you still have energy,\n\nOh, I'm not even halfway done. What about you? All right.\n\nGot all the energy in the world. Let's maybe a quick bathroom break. Yeah.\n\nA good place to pick up our story here would be John Muir Heimer and Stephen Watt's book. We've talked about Muir Heimer and Walt previously. Now their book is called The Israel Lobby and American-Born Policy. It came out in 2007. It started out as a essay that they wrote first for the Atlantic Month late that commission the story and then refused to run it. And they ended up running it in the London review of books. We also ran it anti-war dot com. People can find it there. It's called the Israel Lobby in American Foreign Policy. It's a fantastic article. And then they made it into a book. And now these guys are, again, the co deans, basically of the Realist School of Foreign Policy. One from the University of Chicago, the other from Harvard.\n\nBoth highly respected, neither of them haters or ideologues or any of these things, they were ruthlessly attacked as antisemites for this, which is completely preposterous. And what they did though was say that, look, man, Israel's interests are very different than ours. And that's why they spend so much money and effort lobbying in the United States to try to obfuscate that fact that what's good for them ain't necessarily good for us at all. Well, they have to make sure it's at least good for the people in charge here, if not for the country itself. And that's their object. And as Walton Heimer say in the essay and in the book that you can't blame the whole Iraq War on them.\n\nGeorge W. Bush was the one sitting in the chair behind that desk calling that shot. He could have changed his mind at the very last moment. It was on him and now is the Congress's responsibility. But they passed that responsibility to him with their unconstitutional authorization that they passed in October of 2002. But like ultimately, who pulled that trigger? George W. Bush did. And in conspiracy with his vice president and his Secretary of Defense and the rest of them. So the neocons, yes, they were the Deputy Secretary of Defense and the Deputy Secretary of Defense for policy. And the, you know, staff in the Vice President's office, the staff of the National Security Council, they were there operating really, as I said, as that, as Colin Powell called it, that separate government and operating mostly for Benjamin Netanyahu's goals.\n\nAnd this is part of what we argued about me and Mark Dubowitz on your show last time was he insisted somewhat, partially, correctly here, that Ariel Sharon wanted Bush to hit Iran, not Iraq. And Ariel Sharon, not Netanyahu was the prime minister.",

      "transcript_chunk": "ator, but a 2018 research paper that looked at the 2008 global financial crisis found that fertility actually started dropping in the months before the crisis hit. This suggests if nothing else, that fertility decisions may be more of a leading indicator than was previously thought. So economic uncertainty is something to think about and when it comes to making predictions in a realm as complicated as fertility with so many variables and so many incentives, there is another area of uncertainty that might surprise you.\n\nConsidering how long we humans have been making babies,\n\nIt feels unjust that we know so little about how our reproductive system works and it's such an important part of human existence.\n\nThat is Diana Laird.\n\nI'm a professor at University of California San Francisco in the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology and in the stem cell program.\n\nUmbc SF has been for the past decade the top funded public academic institution by the NIH, the National Institutes of Health.\n\nMy lab is really interested in where our eggs come from, developmentally speaking, how that process plays out, how it affects aging, and the 39 years in humans that we have for our ovaries to actually work and make babies. Those\n\n39 years refer to the average woman's fertility window between puberty and menopause.\n\nWhat we don't know outweighs what we do know. It's first of all really difficult to capture those early stages. We understand very little about how the embryo knows where to go and why in many patients there's repeated failure of implantation of the embryo. Work with human embryos is not fundable by NIH dollars and actually with fertilized embryos is illegal in many states, so that makes it very difficult to ask those fundamental scientific questions.\n\nIf you are, let's say a government hoping to slow down the fertility decline or even reverse it, you'd think it would be useful to answer those fundamental scientific questions. One question has to do with a woman's lifetime supply of eggs. Cells develop in the female while she's still a fetus, it's believed that she starts with around 7 million eggs. By the time she's born, she'll have one to 2 million eggs From there, her supply continues to diminish. And why is that?\n\nWe don't really know how these events in the early development of the embryo connect to the number of eggs that we have. Eventually,\n\nLaird likes to use an economic analogy here.\n\nIf I told you that you're gonna have an inheritance of $7 million, you would probably be really happy. And if I said, well, due to market conditions and volatility, by the time you're born it's gonna be more like 1 million. You'd still probably be like, well, a million dollars is pretty good. But then if I told you that, well, by the time you actually need this inheritance, it's gonna be closer to maybe three or 400,000, you would think I was a really bad investor because you know the eggs are our inheritance. I guess I could make it worse and I could tell you that by the time you use them, a lot of those dollars are not gonna be accepted because they won't work\n\nAnd there's even more uncertainty. Physicians and researchers can't accurately measure the number of eggs in a given woman's ovarian reserves, nor do current tests reveal anything about the quality of an egg while it's in a woman's body.\n\nHow is it that a doctor can't actually tell you how many eggs you have if you're 20? How can you start to make plans about how you're gonna live your life, how you're gonna have a career, whether or not you're going to have children, and when that might happen? How can you make all those decisions if you don't even know how long you have to reproduce and if you'll be able to, I'm not saying that everyone needs to reproduce, but I think it should be a choice. It's a very human experience and it's how we continue our species. Unfortunately, the research funds for understanding the basics of reproduction and fertility have been pretty meager.\n\nIndeed. Researchers have found that NIH applications with the words fertility, ovary, and reproductive have the lowest rates of funding acceptance much lower than keywords like protein or glaucoma or mRNA.\n\nIt makes it a little bit less painful when I get grants rejected. It's not just me.\n\nIn February, president Trump signed an executive order called expanding access to in vitro fertilization as part of his administration's push to boost fertility rates. But soon after his administration eliminated the six person team within the Department of Health and Human Services that tracks IVF. So if scientific research isn't the way forward for a government that wants more babies, how about financial incentives coming up after the break?\n\nIt was a decade long experiment that really was considered unsuccessful.\n\nI'm Steven Dubner.

There are so many ways to save on summer grilling favorites at Whole Foods Market.\n\nIt might be tempting to think that fertility rates have only begun falling recently.\n\nOne of the things that my work shows is that fertility rates have declined in other time periods and in other places.\n\nThat's Amy Freud.\n\nI'm a professor of history at the University of Maryland, Baltimore County.\n\nFreud specializes in early modern Britain women's economic history. In particular\n\nIn the 1690s, England was in the midst of really the beginning of over a hundred years of wars against their enemies, the French, and there was a concern about being a strong and prosperous nation that could compete militarily and politically,\n\nAnd that meant growing their populations. Back then, fertility rates were very closely tied to marriage rates. In many places today that connection is much looser, but King William II of England reckoned that boosting marriage would boost fertility, enter the marriage duty act of 1695.\n\nThey began to tax bachelors over the age of 25 and widowers who were childless. Sometimes elite single women were taxed as well.\n\nFreud says this new tax was likely unpopular as Texas tend to be, but did it work?\n\nWe're not sure that we can prove that it raised marriage rates and it also didn't raise enough money for the king and his wars, so it was abandoned in the early 17 hundreds.\n\nFrance meanwhile was also concerned about their fertility rates, but rather than offer a stick in the form of tax, they offered a carrot.\n\nLouis the XIV passes an edict in promotion of marriage in the 1660s, which is even a little earlier than the concern about marriage in England. In this edict, he was willing to offer financial incentives to men who would marry by the age of 21, which was very young. Also, financial incentives to men who fathered large families.\n\nAs with the marriage tax in England, it's hard for historians like Freud to prove whether these incentives boosted fertility. What's interesting is that just a few decades later, both France and England started to study fertility itself.\n\nBoth countries become much more concerned about what we today would call reproduction. In fact, that's a 18th century term. Before that time generation was usually the term, but there's a more scientific conceptualization of producing children that takes hold along with it is an encouragement of new technologies and new people that might be able to ensure that childbirth is more safe and more successful.\n\nIn England at the time, as many as one in three babies were dying in childbirth or soon after\n\nA 33% infant mortality rate is horrific, right? There was a feeling that perhaps female midwives were not doing an adequate job, and over the 18th century we see the introduction of the man midwife. The man midwife was a male who had been educated at a college or university and who was going to bring a more scientific approach to childbirth, and so men begin to push female midwives out of the business of childbirth. That starts at the apex of society. Women of the nobility and royal women begin to use male midwives at the same time, they also embrace new technologies like the forceps, which are developed by the man midwife family.\n\nThe Chamberlains\n\nSide note here, the Chamberlains family hoarded their invention for more than a century, not sharing it outside their well-bred circle. This withholding of the forceps is thought to have cost millions of lives in France. Meanwhile, the midwife industry went in a different direction.\n\nLouis the 15th decides that he needs to train midwives better and the person he chooses to do that is a woman. Her name was Madam Dre Re was a Parisian midwife who received training and then was part of a regulated body of midwives. She had some of the highest earning power amongst Parisian midwives, and so the king sent her around the country to different cities and towns where she trained local female midwives in some of the up-to-date ways of delivering children that she had been taught in Paris.\n\nMadam Dere promoted a different style of midwifery than the male midwives.\n\nFemale midwives would argue they didn't need forceps because they could handle complicated births with their own hands. Coudray also felt that technology instead of being used in the birthing process, should be used in the teaching process. She developed what she called her machine or her mannequin, which was a simulated pelvis of a woman with accoutrements, like a fetus and a placenta. She used different types of textiles and materials to try to simulate reality. She would have both hard and soft materials, perhaps leather, perhaps linen, different colored materials to indicate different parts of the anatomy.\n\nIt shows her understanding of anatomy, her practical nature, her inventiveness.\n\nCoudray also published a midwife handbook with colored anatomical plates.\n\nIt's hard to prove causality, but we do see in some areas that live births and successful live births were going up. There's a wonderful book by Nina Gelbart called The King's Midwife, where she argues that you could extrapolate the number of successful births based on re's training and then the midwives who followed her training. That kind of thing can be hard to trace though for the 18th century, and one of the sad things is so many records were destroyed in the French revolutionary period.\n\nIf you go back to 18th century England. Meanwhile, it does seem like there was a fertility rebound as evidenced by new concerns about overpopulation,\n\nPeople began to discuss the idea of limiting population as a way to improve one's economy. England is often taken as the example of a country that did that early that is associated with industrialization and the idea that perhaps not as many people are needed to work in the economy. And so it's interesting to me as a historian to see us returning to concerns about having enough workers.\n\nThis is really an eternal question. How many people should be allowed or encouraged to exist in a given space and place? This question can quickly migrate into the political sphere, and from there it's a short step to government policy. Our era is not immune. This recent concern about too few babies, it can feel like whiplash after all those decades of concern about overpopulation and of course before that were more under population worries and so on and so on and so forth. I wasn't kidding when I called it an eternal question, and it swings both ways.\n\nAt the moment. Governments in many countries are trying to boost their babyhood through tax benefits, better parental leave, cash bonuses, state sponsored matchmaking apps, and much more will they work. Here again is the economist, Mattia Stka.\n\nThese are the biggest decisions we take in our lives and you see in the data that people don't respond very strongly to short run changes in policy. Financial incentives. If you just give a bonus for having more children, you know people do respond. They don't respond very much. They are in many ways set in their ways and you make a plan and you will not change it like government by government.\n\nIf you were Secretary of Higher Fertility in Washington in a future time, what would be your best ideas society-wide, and not just perhaps around the time of birth, but what would be your biggest society economy-wide ideas for providing the best situation to boost fertility?\n\nI think we want to imagine what kind of society will want people to have larger families and what are the things holding them back. Right now, we have mentioned many of them. One is this issue of compatibility of careers and having children. That has to do with making it easier for women to rejoin the labor force after they have children, more childcare provision. Another part that's also coming to focus with the epidemic is this issue of flexibility of jobs. If you have a job but it's completely inflexible, meaning you have to be there 10 hours every day, you can never leave. If, for example, a child has a fever or has a theater performance, that will also make it more difficult. So creating workplaces that are a bit more flexible for everybody will also make it easier for families to decide to have that additional child.\n\nI went back to Catherine Alek, the economist mother of 14, an author of Hannah's children.\n\nI don't believe that policymakers ought to aim to influence household decision making as regards children. The reason I say that is because those costs and benefits, the big ones, the ones that are really affecting our current situation, those are subjective and personal policy can't hit those things.\n\nDo you feel that that position aligns you with a particular political movement or even a name?\n\nI sometimes use the language of a pragmatic libertarian, pragmatic in the sense that I'm not committed to the philosophical foundations of libertarianism.\n\nYou write, the flourishing of traditional religious institutions breaks the low marriage, low fertility cycle. People will lay down their comfort dreams and selves for God, not for subsidies. Can you say a little bit more about that? Because as the global fertility rate falls, we're seeing more and more governments take all kinds of measures to try to boost births. As far as I can tell, most of these fail or they might produce a short term birth boom, but that seems to be just a timing thing, that it's not actually encouraging people to have more children. Just the timing. Can you talk about the ways in which as you write it, government subsidies are weaker than internal or religious guidance?",

I just thought people ought to hear it. But he's, man, it was a blessing that he came along when he did, he was like, it really changed both of our lives.\n\nWe gotta talk about that. So you posted the, the song Richmond, North of Richmond on August 8th, 2023. I\n\nRemember I was at work that day when it went up. Yeah.\n\nSo it blew the fuck up straight to number one on the charts. Tens of millions of views and listens. And a few days later on August 17th, you made a post that I thought was pretty gangster, was beautiful and gangster. So one, one of the things you said is it's been difficult as I browse through the 50,000 plus messages and emails I've received in the last week, the stories that have been shared, paint a brutally honest picture. Suicide addiction, unemployment, anxiety, depression, hopelessness, and the list goes on. And then you went on to write people in the music industry, gimme blank stares, when I brush off $8 million offers, I don't want six tour buses, 15 tractor trailers in a jet.\n\nI don't want to place stadium shows. I don't want to be in the spotlight. I wrote the music I wrote because I was suffering with mental health and depression. These songs have connected with millions of people on such a deep level because they've been sung by someone feeling the words in the very moment. They were being sung, no editing, no agent, no bullshit, just some idiot in his guitar. The style of music that we should have never gotten away from in the first place. So huge props for that, for walking away from lucrative multimillion dollar record deals. And I'm sure the money that was just coming your way, huge props.\n\nYou know, moments happen where, you know, the world tests you and integrity is what you do in those moments. So huge props for that. What was your philosophy? What was your thinking behind that?\n\nIt was all those messages I got. I mean, you can see it in the comment sections of a lot of the videos after everything hap. But people just like felt this spark like, like, wow, like maybe we actually have a chance to like, maybe we actually do have some kind of power. You know, like those people put that song there, nobody else and like gave me the opportunity to make, even without signing anything, I was still able to make millions of dollars and have financial freedom. And like, I just, I just felt like, I felt like if I was gonna do anything like that, that I'd be, I'd be betraying, like I would be taking those people and, and almost betraying them somehow. You know, like, like they, I hate the big machine just like everybody else.\n\nAnd I, the last thing I'd want to do is be, is ever support it or be a part of it. Like I wanna watch it crash and burn. You know, like,\n\nSee this is the really important thing is whether it was betrayal or not, we'll never know, but you felt like that it was. And to have the integrity to walk away from the bag of money when you felt that way, that's fucking epic.\n\nIt was also, you gotta thank a couple months before this, like of course I had, you know, I had a wife and kids that I loved and like, I had a lot of really important things to live for, but I didn't have a whole lot to lose. Like, like none of this was even really real. Like, it, I didn't care about the, like, I didn't care to lose this just as quick as I got it. Like this didn't, this was, this didn't mean anything to me. It just meant something to me that like, that I could do something for. Like, you know, you, it's like even if I'm not smart enough to figure out how to fix some of my own problems in my life, the fact that I felt like I could help fix somebody else's like that meant hell of a lot more to me than any. That's what I didn't wanna lose. I didn't wanna lose those people's trust or like feel, you know what I mean?\n\nLike, yeah,\n\nYeah,\n\nYeah. And so I've just tried to make every decision around like as best as I can, like what I think the right thing is to do and who knows what the hell the right thing is to do. But I just try to follow, you know, we all have that little voice in us like that. We all have some what? And and I think sometimes we mask, you know, it's hard for us to listen to that little voice be whether, whether it's like, you know, whether it's our gluttony or our lust or our, or our, you know, we, we numb ourselves with medications or with alcohol or we, we scroll on YouTube for four hours a night and instead of, 'cause we don't wanna listen to our conscience, but there is this like very intelligent, discerning thing inside of us.\n\nIt's able to tell us what's right and wrong and it's a, it's a spiritual thing I guess. And I just try to, I just try to listen to that when I can. I don't know, I just still feel like I haven't done\n\nEnough. I think you, I think you did a lot. I think you did a lot. I think you're an inspiration. You have helped a huge number of people and you're also an inspiration to the other side of it, which is the artists and just to humans to have integrity. I don't think people realize how much of a te test of integrity, Fame, money, you know, power also is, you know, Rogan and I talk about this quite a bit. We get to see, I mean Joe especially, but I haven't, I've had a bit of the same, you get to see people become famous and you get to see how they deal with that.\n\nAnd it's not easy. A lot of people will sell themselves a bit, sell the soul a bit, give away a bit of their integrity of the spirit that made them who they are. You get caught up in the wave of it, you know? And so to, to keep on holding onto that, that's a powerful thing. That's a really, yeah,\n\nThat's all I got though. You know? Yeah. When you lose that, what the hell are you like? And you see it like, you see these celebrity people that just like fall off the, they fall off the, you know, they go off the deep end. It's like it's, you gotta have, you have to have something in your life to, and to keep you centered and to keep you, you know, your whole perception of reality and like your just existence in reality is all contingent upon this sort of like this center that you exist in. And you have to, if you don't have that then you're just flying through spa through sp I mean we're all just riding on this rock that's going, who knows how fast.\n\nYou said something I think to Jocko that I really liked, everything that has purpose behind it comes with risk. So there in that moment, I mean, you're taking a hell of a risk.\n\nI was terrified. I talked about this a little bit with him too, but I was terrified to even put the song out. Like I knew I was gonna be the subject of scrutiny and judgment and I knew people were going to like, you know, I kind of knew all that was gonna happen. I was like going back to that, talking about crowds like to stand in front of thousands of people and everybody being some sense of unity. Like a lot of times when I end the shows, I'll always, I'll always end with this statement that just says, you know, no matter what, like, no matter how you feel when you go online, you know, everyone feels so small and insignificant and, and powerless, but I just say, no matter how they make you feel online or when you turn on the tv, or when you look at polling numbers or whatever, like when you just look at all this trash that we digest every day, like you're, there's always, there will always be more of us than them and, and all that.\n\nAnd, but like to see the, like, just to see the light in people's eyes when you say that, but the truth is like, and it's like, who is us and who is them? And it's like us just represents humanity and like, and, and all the things we talked about so far, like just, you know, the fire and the chaos and, but also the like, the love and just, just life. Life is just such a crazy complicated, beautiful, disastrous thing. And then them is like, it is, it's the power structure. It's the, it's that same terrible side of us that created things like the Soviet Union and, and, and is ultimately what's created this monster, this like monster that we all live under today, which now is not just, doesn't just exist within the confines of the Soviet Union, but seems to almost be a global epidemic.\n\nAnd then that song became the rebel call against that, against the power structures that creates that.\n\nYeah. It's like, how much fire am I willing to play with? 'cause I know it's something when I am gonna get burned from it. I just pray a lot that God, I don't have a lot of self worth in myself anyway. So I don't really care what they say or do to me, or I don't care. Like I don't even care if I die, whatever. Just don't let, just, just protect the people I love is all, that's all I ask of God. I have this dream of just creating this parallel system that sits beside all these stupid systems that we live under that are all sort of engulfed in this, this thing that we talked about at the beginning. This, this type of structure. You know, where none of us, where we're all just robots. And it's like, if we hate, you know, if we hate the way music is and all these artists are complaining about the way the venues are monopolizing, the ticket sales are monopolizing, let's just go find other places to play music.\n\n'cause there's so many people hungry for music and places that don't ever get it. And if you look at it, there's so many passionate people that are fighting all these different causes, like, like just in food, it's the word they use for ba for more or less starvation. It's a more polite, it's called food insecurity. But if you look up just in Virginia, just where I live in Virginia, in the rural areas, how much food insecurity there is and how many empty vacant farms there are. It's like, this is an obvious problem that we should be on Twitter talking about nonstop. Like this is like, everyone has to eat, you know, it don't matter what you vote for or what, like what you look like or any of that crap. You can, you know, like, so like let's just like, why, why are we living in a country where we ha why are we living in a country where half of us are obese and eating shit food and don't know any better?\n\nAnd then the other half of us don't have like, how just, it's just, it's lack of leadership that's caused dysfunction. And so if we're tired of that, then then let's just fix it. Like we don't need anybody's permission. Like that's the whole beauty. Like that's the whole beauty of what America is, is like, we don't, we don't need some greasy haired corporate schmuck to give us permission to go fix all these things that are wrong. Let's just go do it. And if they don't like it, fuck 'em. You know,\n\nIn all domains of life from, from food to the music industry, honestly, to education also to government itself, all of it. And that, you know, your music is also just the soundtrack to that spirit that makes America great of just constantly trying to revitalize itself. When the bullshit piles up a little too high, there's that revolutionary spirit that says like, we need to fix this shit.\n\nAnd, and that inspiration that created this country was from years of people living under tyranny. Like, we forget the story of the people who really created this country. Like, it's funny, I, one of the statements I made at the very beginning that got taken way outta context, but I wasn't in a position to like even begin to have a conversation about, is I made this comment early on at one of the shows about, about how, about how our diversity is a strength, but that term has been hijacked now to mean something a lot different than what it really means. But it's like, think about how many different people came together just at the founding of this country. Like people who spoke different languages, different cultures, religions, ways of thinking. So many different people came together to even create this place now.\n\nAnd like we've just forgotten about all that. They didn't all come here because they wanted to ride on some miserable boat ride and risk their whole lives to Go to live in some crazy jungle essentially that had no structure, like no infrastructure, no medicine, no. Like, they didn't come here for like, some glorified camping trip. It's because they were tired of like generations of being persecuted and living under tyranny and not being allowed to practice their, you know, it's not like they wanted freedom of religion and they didn't want separation of church and state because they were a bunch of goody two shoes and they love going to church every Sunday. It's because they weren't allowed to believe in what they believed in because some asshole king or some hierarchy told 'em they couldn't and they were just tired of it. That's what we're losing now is like we've forgotten that we're those people, like the same structures that have plagued this country are, they're multinational corporations and their, and it's just the ideology behind them and their, and their structure is what the problem is.\n\nYeah. I mean, it's multinational corporations, it's nation states that are deeply corrupt and are authoritarian and ultimately abuse power and yes. Create elements of tyranny. And from that, the, the human spirit rises, like I said, with, with with songs like the ones you write or at the founding in this country. You know, that's why all this diverse outcasts come together and write something as crazy as all men are created equal. Yeah. What a gangster line.\n\nI, that's not an easy thing to take a lot of that stuff for granted now, but that's not an easy thing to come up with. That's a really gutsy thing to, to see, to see the value in all people equally. And of course they also were suffering from delusion, you know, they didn't see black people as equal. They didn't see women as equal. But even that first leap of like, all men are created equal, that's like a gigantic fuck you to the past.\n\nTaking that leap forward really took a lot in a age and a time when, when it probably sounded cr and it's not like they just made a statement and put it on Twitter. Like they, they like think about how much, just think about the insanity. Like I can't even conceptualize the insanity of what took place from the time that, like, even from the Revolutionary War until now to try to preserve that idea, you know? So like, so much has happened and so much sacrifice has been made in just so many hours of labor and thought and intensity. Even\n\nThe 20th century's got two world wars and you know, especially in the second World War, the United States played a very crucial role and there was a lot of ideological, like battle of ideas going on at that time. Yeah. Of the role of war and peace, of the role of the United States as the, as the center place for the ideal of human freedom and human rights. Yeah. We continue to innovate. So I'd love to get back to talking to blue collar people you mentioned. Those are some of my favorite people. So it was actually really cool to find out that for many years of your life, basically the way you made a living is talking to blue collar people and getting their story.\n\nSo I'm traveling across the world for a bit, but of course the world I I love the most and I'm most curious about is the different subcultures and towns of the United States.",

      "transcript_chunk": "interview with them after two hours and you felt that you have been boxing almost physically exhausted, but generally for an industry that thrives in secrecy, a lot of the all hands were quite open and willing to tell stories that often you couldn't believe.\n\nIt sounds like you're saying they are willing because what they did was kind of extraordinary.\n\nThese people who were retired, they were telling you deals that they did in Angola in 1975 or on Cuba in 1985 or in the Soviet Union after the collapse of the Berlin Wall. They were very proud of what they did and how they made money. Also, it was a bit of a different world where perhaps corruption was not seen as is today. These were executives which made business in very difficult corners of the wall, and they were operating from Switzerland, a country that not only allow companies to pay bribes overseas, but allow companies to deduct the payments as a tax credit.\n\nBribes were tax deductible in Switzerland until about a decade ago.\n\nTo understand how Switzerland became the epicenter of this industry, it helps to understand a commodity trader named Mark Rich Bloss and Farci write about Rich a good bit in their book. There's also a very good Mark Rich biography called The King of Oil by Danielle Aman. At least the chapters I read were very good. Here's Farci again.\n\nMark Rich was the godfather of the modern commodity trading industry to a significant extent invented the industry. Rich was born into a Jewish family in Belgium in the 1930s like many other Jews in Europe in the 1930s, and like many of the people who had go on to be big players in the commodity trading industry moved to the US because of the rise of Nazism in Europe in the post-war period, got his apprenticeship at Philip Brothers Fibo, which was in the 1950s and 1960s, the dominant force in commodity trading and really kind of invented a lot of the ways in which commodity traders do business and make money. But there was something gentleman Lee and genteel in Philip Brothers and Mark Rich was this super aggressive, totally driven, always focused entirely on money and nothing else.\n\nCharacter Philip Brothers was too small for him. In\n\n1974, rich and his trading partner, Pinkus Pinky Green left Philip brothers to form their own firm, which would become a powerhouse. It was called Mark Rich and Co.\n\nHe got his big break when the oil market began to fragment and the seven sisters, these big American, European oil companies, began to lose control of the oil market and he started trading oil with abandon at a time when the tradable oil market was only just becoming a thing. Talk\n\nAbout the ways in which he did things differently from everybody, or maybe another way to put it is the risks he was willing to take, the different actors he was willing to engage with, et cetera. A\n\nLot of what you needed to do to make money in the oil trade in those early days was to have a good enough relationship with one of the big oil producers that they would sell you oil at a price that was probably too low. One of his big trade flows was through this extremely secretive pipeline that went through Israel that was built as a joint venture between Israel and Iran before the fall of the S Shah in great secrecy and Mark Rich would be buying Iranian oil, putting it through the the pipeline, supplying Israel, but also supplying Europe through this pipeline, which then became enormously valuable when the Suez Canal closed in 1967 after Israel launched an attack on Egypt and Syria.\n\nThis brief ward was over, but the Suez Canal stayed closed until 1975 and for Mark Rich, that was a gift from the gods and he made huge amounts of money. Mark Rich became this almost larger than life figure in commodity trading, the most profitable commodity trader ever. We spoke to a number of former senior people at Mark Rich who said that the company made a billion dollars of profit in 1979, the era of the Iranian revolution, which in those days would've made it one of the 10 largest companies in America. And this was a company owned by a small handful of people that only people in the commodities industry had ever heard of, but that didn't last because Mark Rich caught the attention of US law and particularly of Rudy Giuliani, then a prosecutor who indicted him for tax fraud and for trading with Iran during the hostage crisis.\n\nSo he and his partner, pinky Green, fled the US to Switzerland, became fugitives from US Justice, and then carried on their business of being the world's largest commodity trading house, despite this US indictment hanging over their head. And that continued for a number of years. His real undoing came when he lost money in 19 91, 19 92, when one of Mark Rich's zinc traders under the influence of Mark Rich himself attempted to corner zinc market and it went horribly wrong. Mark Rich lost about $170 million on this attempted zinc corner that was really the last straw. His underlings rounded on him and forced him outta the company.\n\nThe company was renamed as Glencore and continues as one of the largest commodity traders. Today,\n\nGlenco is not only the world's largest commodity trader, but it's also a conglomerate. They do everything and anything. They trade a lot of energy, whether is crude oil, natural gas, refined products, a lot of coal. They used to trade a lot of agriculture and they trade a lot of metals and minerals.\n\nIt strikes me that the commodity traders are performing a variety of big functions. They're acting like bankers. They're acting as sort of a government coming in to help another country try to stabilize itself or maybe more like one of the big financial institutions like a World Bank. Can you think of any in history parallels to the functions that these commodity traders were performing? The\n\nCommodity traders look like one of those Swiss knives where you could have everything out of them. They are the bankers of last resort when no one else will take your phone, call for a credit line, they will offer you money. They're the McKinsey, the consultant for lost causes where someone doesn't know how a market works, they will come there and explain it to you, and they're almost like diplomats for hire where you have a foreign affairs problem. They can explain how to make it work. The joke in the oil trading industry was that beetle, the was largest oil trader was the trading arm of MI six, the secret service of James Bond. There is a grain of truth behind that joke.\n\nI can't imagine the same joke doesn't exist for the CIA, correct\n\nThe CIA. I don't think that they have an in-house trading house. However, Philip brothers of fro a big American trading house of the seventies and eighties was known to have very close links to the CIA and just generally, the American government. At times, firo will help American governments, and at times the American government will be a bit surprised to find out that things were happening against the interest of American policy makers and diplomats because Firo was helping the other side\n\nComing up after the break. When the political situation gets turbulent, the commodity traders are often the first people to step into the breach.\n\nThere comes a time where governments need things to happen, where having a commodity trader helping may come handy and where everyone can deny their involvement.\n\nI'm Steven Dubner.

The authors are Javier Bloss and Jack Farci, a pair of financial journalists at Bloomberg. I once had a professor who said that when historians write books, they always search for the big macro thesis, all the different events and populations that contribute to producing whatever it is, a war, a new country or whatever. But that often it really is the product of two people sitting in a room making a deal, having conversation, shaking a hand. To that end, I'd like you to talk about Jamaica for a minute, and the story you tell in your book,\n\nSingle Moments and single deals and single trades can shape the course of history. The Jamaican example was the early 1980s, and this was told to me by a guy called Hugh Hart, who was at the time the Minister for Mines and Energy in the Jamaican government. The Jamaican economy was in pretty tough shape. It was reliant on oil imports and oil prices had surged and the oil crisis and the Jamaican economy was pretty much on its knees. Each month, Jamaica would import about 300,000 barrels of oil,\n\nWhich is like one tanker. Yeah,\n\nIt's one tanker of oil, exactly. By the standards of today's big tankers, a fraction of a tanker, it would import 300,000 barrels of oil, which would go to the refinery in Kingston, and that would supply Jamaica's oil consumption for the month. In order to do that, the central bank would open a letter of credit, which would allow Jamaica to pay for the oil. So Hugh Hart was in his office one Friday afternoon and someone came to see him from the Central Bank in a state of agitation. He said, what's going on? What's the matter? And he said, we've got a problem. The problem is we don't have any money. We can't open the letter of credit. Without that, Jamaica wouldn't be able to buy this cargo of oil.\n\nThey would run out of oil over the weekend, and\n\nThey're literally burning oil for electricity, right? Yeah,\n\nAnd fueling cars. And you know, the petrol stations would run dry and there would be chaos on the streets. This was a fairly febrile time in the Jamaican economy and Jamaican politics, and he thought there would be riots and revolution if they didn't get any oil, and this was a Friday afternoon, so he thought, who do I call? And the only person he could think of to call was Mark Richen Co. The company that is today, Glencore. He called his contact at Mark Rich, who was in New York, who said, I can't help you. I'm a metals trader, but try Mark Rich himself. And so he calls Mark Rich in Switzerland. It's two in the morning. He gets Mark Rich outta bed. Mark Rich says, who are you? What do you want? And he says, well, I'm the minister of energy in Jamaica and I need some oil. And Mark Rich says, huh, okay, call back in an hour.\n\nAnd in that hour, Mark Rich has arranged for a tank of oil that was going from Venezuela to the US to be diverted to Jamaica, delivers the oil, averts the crisis without even a contract being signed without any payment, and saves Jamaica's Day as Hugh Hart told it to me, which is an amazing story of a commodity trader, very likely changing the course of history\n\nBecause there might have been a new government in Jamaica by Tuesday if he hadn't done that.\n\nAbsolutely.\n\nWhat did Mark Rich get out of that?\n\nMark Rich got a very long relationship in Jamaica that made him an awful lot of money. Jamaica was then a really big producer of Illumina, which is the raw material for aluminum. Mark Rich came in and struck a whole series of deals to buy Jamaican Illumina below the global market price and made hundreds of millions of dollars over the years to the point that later Jamaican governments turned around and said, Mark Rich was taking advantage of the country. They were making far too much money and Jamaica was losing out, which probably was true, but at the same time, there was a moment in the early 1980s where Mark Rich saved Jamaica's skin. So this relationship between Mark Rich and Jamaica deepened and took all kinds of interesting turns to the extent that Hugh Hart later on took a portfolio in charge of sport.\n\nAnd when Jamaica was putting together a Bob Slay team for the 1988 Olympics, Mark Rich actually helped to finance this Bob Slay team. That then, of course, became the star of the Disney film Cool Runnings, and that was paid for by Mark Rich.\n\nMark Rich died in 2013, but before he did, he pulled off one more mega deal. He got himself a presidential pardon from Bill Clinton. Critics called this contemptuous. Even Clinton himself would later say he regretted it. So how did commodity traders like Rich come to be so powerful in the first place? In their book, Javier Bloss and Jack Farci point to four key factors since World War II that have shaped the industry. Here's Bloss.\n\nThe first one is Nationalizations of the oil industry, starting from 1950, but really culminating in the 1970s where a lot of Middle East and North African countries took control of their oil destiny, kick out foreign power and nationalize the industries.\n\nSay just a little bit more about the seven Sisters and how the new players came in there.\n\nThe seven sisters were seven vertically integrated American, British, and French companies. That until 1973 dominated the oil market at that point. Typically, a barrel of oil will be produced in an exon oil field, transported in an exon pipeline or an exon tanker into an ex Exxon refinery and an ex Exxon fuel station. Every step of the chain, ex Exxon has its name at the same for bp Shell and what is today total of France at one point, that is broken apart and the companies lose a lot of access to the production and that production is nationalized is not longer the Saudi American oil company, but the Saudi Arabian oil company that does the drilling in Saudi Arabia.\n\nThey have a lot of oil to sell and found that commodity traders were willing to buy the oil and also that they didn't ask too many questions and they were very happy to pay a few bribes in the process. Also, it's a time where oil goes from a rather boring commodity to really a big business. Prices explode. They go from a couple of dollars to $5 to $11 to $30 in the space of about 15 years. A lot of these companies make a lot of money because they replace the traditional vertical integrated oil company with something in between.\n\nThey became the lean between the new very rich, middle East, petro states and the consumers in America and Europe.\n\nOkay. That's the first big factor you identify.",

      "transcript_chunk": "realistic deal that somehow American companies will be better protected through IP protection. And again, that's in China's interest as well. So I don't see a fundamental conflict here. And at the same time, they lower the Tariffs, right?\n\nNot to the rates where they were before, but lower and you don't prohibit trade. And then for China, that would also be success. So you can actually have success for both, both places. But being realistic is, is part of the game\n\nIs Tariffs. Question to you as an economist, is Tariffs a useful, effective tool for global trade?\n\nNo, I think that there is a real problem in global trading system and globalization in general that is not gonna be resolved by Tariffs. We do need to think about more harmony between countries where let's say not one country dominates. And here I would, I I'd push back on China and say, yes, you have amazing companies and competitive companies, but you just can't dominate everything that would not be good for global harmony. You need to give other countries an opportunity. You need to develop your own internal economy, right? Rely on your consumers as part of the deal.\n\nTariffs. This kind of highly protectionist method is very distortionary and it's gonna be bad for the us. I'd actually argue that both China and the US have totally taken advantage and also enjoyed the global economic realm under the US liberal order. I think that China quite likes it actually. You know, US kept a peace. And during this peaceful times, things were working very well economically, technologically, they kept the sea lanes open, they did their part to preserve peace to the extent they, they can, I guess.\n\nBut China wants peace, right? Only with peace can they do what they can. And actually us, despite saying they've been victimized, not, look, they've had a very, very good time, right? Never have quality of life standards of living technology risen as much as the US did under its own liberal order than it has ever before. And the amount of influence and power, yes, of course you can blame the US for lots of things that happened, but it actually had a really good time and China as well. So now they're gonna take this apart. They think that they're gonna be somehow better off that American people and Chinese people are gonna be better off under more disorderly, fragmented rule of a jungle kind of world.\n\nThat's an illusion. That's what politicians tell their people. But that's not the truth.\n\nSo what are, if not Tariffs, ways to incentivize countries like the United States to build internally? So to build semiconductor ships internally, for example?\n\nWell, exactly. Tariffs is a way to punish foreigners. But what you really wanna do is to strengthen your own domestic competitiveness. And I wanna draw an analogy to the US Japan competition. In the 1980s, Japan actually took over in many parts of the semiconductors industry, even though the microchip was invented in the us. But guess what happened? Well, it actually drove more competition and more mobilization in the US actually creating this innovation system changed a few really critical laws that helped with US innovation. And the consumers benefited. The US took over again, as the leader of the semiconductors industry, there's no better way than to strengthen yourself to be competitive because ultimately Tariffs have not done anything to help the us The trade deficits have have widened since Trump, right?\n\nThey haven't closed the imbalance with, with China, with the rest of the world, because ultimately the US saves less than in invest. And that's a macro phenomenon. It's not a trade phenomenon. But I I, I fear that the US by kind of dropping off of this global trading network and system, it will lose more and more of its power. You have power when you're deeply engaged and embedded with a country. Once you've left it, you actually lose any sort of leverage.\n\nSo there, there's gotta be ways to incentivize industrial policy, building more stuff in internally without terrorists, right? So you just invest from a federal perspective, you've invest in companies maybe like care more carrot than carrot towards the domestic versus stick versus the foreigner.\n\nAll kinds of subsidies that are justified for the green transition for innovation r and d support for the university system, you know, the, the US is the world leader in terms of attracting talent, has everything going for it. But it was a little bit complacent. And by dropping off of that global network, it's gonna do itself more disservice.\n\nYeah. Terrorists don't quite make sense to me, but maybe I'm dumb. It just doesn't make,\n\nIt doesn't make sense to economists either. And economists are not all dumb.\n\nAll right. You did mention immigration a little bit, so I think that's a component of it also. You said your own experience was that US was much more open to immigration in the past. What do you think about this on the human side, the protectionism, the, the closing of the borders that the US is doing? Is that, what are the pros and cons of that from an economics perspective\n\nOn US immigration? You see, I un I understand both sides of the story to be very honest. And I also understand a bit of the protectionist streak, not only coming from the US but also from Europe and various parts of the world, which is gonna be a trend. I understand that before you care about people in the rural villages in Indonesia, you really care about, you know, the northern Brits in this country and they have not fared well. I understand that your jobs may be under threat because of this uncontrolled influx of, of, you know, illegal immigrants. From a purely economic and rational level, you'd say immigration is very important because it keeps the prices down, keeps inflation down, it keeps up the supply, which is very important when you have that much demand.\n\nAnd look, you know, the standards of living have also improved for many people who can afford it, right? The, the low cost workers being able to sustain the service economy. So I understand both sides of the story. I think that in the end it is a balance. And I do believe even as an economist, that social harmony and I come back to this word harmony repeatedly, even though as an economist, this thing doesn't even exist. Yeah. Is becoming ever more important. And as a, as a nation, you know, some kinds of skilled immigration is actually what makes the US the most technologically advanced country in the world.\n\nAt the same time, you do have to think about your own citizens, the ones that have had generations and been around, and you have to think about their livelihoods.\n\nYeah. The puzzle of social harmony is a fascinating one. 'cause you spoke to the, the long history of China, how they Yeah,\n\nThat was Confucius.\n\nYeah, that's Confucius. And then there is a kind of social harmony, a very different set of ideologies in the United States and in the west broadly. And it's all a puzzle and you do want to have some cohesion. But in the United States, one of it beautiful aspects is the diversity of humans. And so the continued influx of diversity is, you know, feeds the machine that makes America great also, but too much breaks the fabric of that society. So it such an interesting puzzle and it, some of it is like we humans can't balance.\n\nSo you go one extreme the other. Yeah. And you just oscillate back and forth. And then also politics, especially in the United States, there's a red team and the, and a blue team and they, they, when, when the, when the red team is at the top, the blue team just pulls all the way to the other direction and vice versa. And we just kind of oscillate back and forth in this way and hopefully make progress over time.\n\nBut I wanna come back to the point of choice, right? What makes America so great is that it tolerates instability. It tolerates clashes, it tolerates volatility. Think about the financial crisis, right? The financial volatility of, again, the US dollar is where it is because of this deep liquid financial system in the US that no other country has managed to build. There are clashes everywhere in society, but it is a very diverse country with all the benefits to that. It is a highly, highly unequal country.\n\nEconomically speaking, these, the CEO pays, right? The, the, the businessmen being able to be in top political positions, you, you kind of balk at that, that level of cronyism if you will. But you know, the US is the technological leadership and it kind of is a able to stomach that volatility and clash without breaking apart. And other countries don't have the capacity of the institutions, the culture to be able to tolerate and still maintain, to keep the society together. So I think it is a very interesting, but yeah, it's a puzzle.\n\nSo we talked about the economic side of Tariffs and you mentioned the other red line and the three Ts. Can we talk about Taiwan? So how important is Taiwan to the Chinese economy and the, and the global economy?\n\nTaiwan has, among other things, TSMC, which is vitally important for the global economy, it's also very important for the Chinese leadership and the Chinese people. You don't wanna ask what I think ask the Chinese young generation. They would one day like to see unification. It's part of the patriotic, the dream, if you will. So, and it's, it's a chip right between the US and China. So everybody is watching Taiwan, but I'd say that this attention is not necessarily good for Taiwan because all this uncertainty on the political risk has meant that investment there has dramatically been curtailed.\n\nAnd mainland China is a very, very important economic partner to the Taiwanese economy. I think that I don't have a lot of views about around this, but I just say this, I think there's more political wisdom of the Chinese government side than we assume outside of China. And that strategic ambiguity, but also strategic patience, especially given China's economic situation currently means that more likely or not, I think that if China does really well economically and Taiwan is not doing as well economically as we've seen that over time, this is still the best strategy from China's point of view to resolve these differences.\n\nI think any military use and action would be actually quite detrimental to China.\n\nSo what's a way to a avoid military conflict here? It seems like a red line unification is the red line for the United States and it just feels like a very tense situation. So is there a path forward here that avoids any mil military conflict where everybody's happy from an economics perspective, from a semiconductor manufacturer perspective also?\n\nWell, first of all, you have to keep the communication channel open, right? There was a risk of that being shut off during the Biden administration. That's highly, highly dangerous.\n\nYou meaning US China communication. Yeah.\n\nThere's also something that I think people miss, which is that the, the soldiers in mainland China, that's part of the one child policy generation, right? There's only one son. Families have only one son. And I think to assume that the Chinese people desire and would be able to forsake that generation for unification purposes or be able to tolerate lost lives for this, I think is also a bit of, of an exaggeration in stress. And I think Chinese people also really, they really care about peace and stability.\n\nChaos is just not part of what they think is good for them. The role that TSMC plays is so critical given the choke point they have on the rest of the world in the semiconductors industry, which we know is one of the most important industries. Sustaining the economy. Not to mention things like AI and technologies. Look, you know, the US has been trying to, to build another TSMC outside of Taiwan, it's very, very, very slow, right? There are a lot of cumulative knowledge, experience and skills that are involved.\n\nIt's not that easy. The Chinese don't wanna see an eruption of TSMC either, because again, it's vitally important for everybody. Whilst I don't think that this is really necessarily a bargaining chip, because if you really see what the Chinese thinks about Taiwan, it goes beyond economics. It goes beyond the logical, it is about, you know, realizing a dream, which even I, I, I tended to not place enough importance, but when I talk to the young people in China, I realized that it's still their dream.\n\nIt's just unfortunate that this dream is mixed up in the fact that Taiwan with TSMC has been incredibly good at manufacturing. It's just like a interesting puzzle of why it's so difficult, a low cost at scale to manufacture chips. And it's just in incredible that they were able to do it. And it's a interesting puzzle for how China can do it domestically and how US can do it domestically. Yeah, and it seems like there's increasing urgency on that. And I think if we look out in the next a hundred years, the urgency is good because it's probably good for each individual country to be manufacturing majority of their chips, right? It just, it's less likely to lead to conflict.\n\nWell this is the trend that you need to manufacturing things that are important for national security. It's not efficient, but it's so-called strategically safer.\n\nYou mentioned one child policy, so can we speak a little bit more to that? Like what broadly, what impact has it had on the Chinese society on culture? You already mentioned some of it, some of the impact on the economics, on the culture, on the demographics of China,\n\nIt's probably one of the most radical policies that China has enacted through in its history. And the enforcement was very strict in my class. Nobody had a sibling except my friend who was a weaker, 98% of urban households had only one child. The other 2% are twins, which you're allowed to keep, thank goodness if you had the good fortune of giving birth to twins, it had lots of unintended consequences on the economy and society as well. Maybe on the good side, it's actually a golden age for Chinese women because the Chinese girls never had as much education investment a portion to them as they've had after being the only child in the family.\n\nAnd you raised a daughter like a son. And if we look at all the skill gaps and the education gaps and the returns to education, actually girls fared better. Apart from the top, top, top leadership in the Chinese political class. You look at the CEOs and major companies, the in the ministries, civil servants, there are a lot of Chinese women. And actually recently, if you look at the surveys, the Chinese families would prefer to have a daughter than a son because they've seen how much bargaining power you as a Chinese woman and as a rare bride or a scarce supply of brides goes, you have raised your bargaining power and you can command high amounts of dowry.\n\nThat was an unintended good thing about the one child policy. And to the opposite, the recent relaxation of the one child policy. Actually women are now encouraged to have many as many kids as they possibly can. The flip side of the one child policy has not necessarily been good for to women in the job mar job market because they think, oh, well you've only had one child. Oh, guess what? You can have another child. So that's not necessarily good for long-term employability. But on the economic side, I've written about this in my academic papers, it's been one of the very important causes of high saving rate.\n\nYou know, I always tell people, you want to stimulate consumption, we'll have more kids. You know how much one of those costs, right? Yeah. Especially in China. Yeah. The tutorial ships the education and they have to buy a house. You have to buy a house for them so that they can get married eventually. Yep. So it's very, very expensive to have a, have a child. If have more children, you spend more, but maybe people don't wanna have more children because the, the cost of having a child is so high and this is driven by the competition.",

My father alerted me everything. You have to have a good interest in what you're doing and it's whatever you do. If you don't have the interest, you will be not so good.\n\nWhat about the crew size on your boat?\n\nWe are six people all year.\n\nThey work for you year round the same six?\n\nYeah.\n\nDo they live in your town\n\nNearby?\n\nWhat's the longest you've ever gone from land then?\n\n2, 3, 4 weeks? We have been on the north side of Bergen, almost 81 degrees north.\n\nWhen you're out on the water, can you describe how you locate the minka whale?\n\nWe only use our eyes.\n\nWow. No sonar, nothing like that?\n\nNo, nothing. It's the best equipment we have.\n\nOkay. So what are you looking for?\n\nOh, looking for the whale.\n\nYou're not looking for birds or a spout.\n\nThe birds as well, they often give away where the whale are so we know to use all nature.\n\nAnd how often does the mink a whale breach?\n\nIt's three to five minute and then they come up and blow three times. We try to get close to the whale and try to think out where it's possible. Where the whale go, you have to think like a whale. It's like a chess player. You have to think some step forward. It's a hunt. You have to get close to it because we don't shoot long distance. It's just a 30 or 40 meter or something like that. Or closer.\n\nAnd describe the harpoon.\n\nThe harpoon is 70 millimeter, but the barrel on the canon is 60 millimeter. So it's a big hole. But the harpoon hits the whale in the front of the harpoon. We have of course the run out. We explode inside a whale.\n\nSo how fast does that kill the whale then?\n\nIt's instant if you don't kill, it may be make it unconscious and then we kill it with the rifle.\n\nAnd what kind of rifle do you use for that?\n\nIt's American rifle 3 75 a Remington.\n\nJust so I'm clear, the grenade that's at the end of the harpoon\n\nIn the front of the harpoon,\n\nWhere do you aim? On the whale for the head, the heart\n\nIn the chest.\n\nAnd then if it doesn't succeed in killing the whale, then you kill it with the rifle? Yes.\n\nYeah.\n\nAnd then how do you get it on the boat?\n\nOh, we have strong wire. We put on the tail and then we pull it up on the deck with a winch.\n\nAnd how big are they?\n\nCould they be up to 10 meter?\n\nWhat does it weigh? 15, 20,000 pounds?\n\nI don't know about pounds. It's up to eight. Nine ton.\n\nSo you get it on the boat with the winch. What happens now? Who butchers it and so on?\n\nOh, it's the crew cutting out the blubber and the meat and then we put the bone back to the sea.\n\nWhat do you do with the blubber?\n\nWe gave it to the birds.\n\nOkay, so the oil is not worth anything?\n\nNot for now. It's a very healthy oil. We haven't managed to get any good system for taking in the oil.\n\nDo they travel solo or in groups?\n\nBoth. But very often the Mickey whale is alone. Solo cowboy. They travel individual and But when they come to places where there are a lot of food, there could be very many.\n\nDoes the Mke whale ever try to attack the boat?\n\nNo.\n\nSome whales do. Yeah,\n\nNo, no. It's more like accidents. You know, you have some YouTube clip where a hump bag guy jump up and fall down on a sailing boat or something like that. But I don't think he's attack. It's just an accident.\n\nYeah. I see. Have you read Moby Dick?\n\nNo, I'm not a reader.\n\nWhen you see a whale breach, how can you tell if it's a mink, a whale, or maybe some other kind of whale?\n\nOh, it's like to see the difference on a horse, on a pig. Maybe you can mix them up if you are from a New York or something like that. But not a crew on the whale boat.\n\nDo you ever hear the whales communicating or singing?\n\nYou could. Sometimes you can hear the white whales and sometimes a humpback.\n\nIf Norway were to allow the hunting of other species of whale, which ones would you wanna hunt?\n\nI have enough with minky whale because we had to have bigger boats and other equipment to hunt bigger whales.\n\nWe spoke with someone in Japan who said that one reason that some whalers, they are still hunt whales, is because the world tells them they can't. And I'm curious if that's the same for you in Norway?\n\nThat's stupid. Yes. That's stupid. I already said that You have to harvest in a sustainable way. It's stupid.\n\nBjorn, we've been working on this series about the history and economics of whaling for about six months, and you are the first whaler who agreed to speak with us. Why do you think that whalers are so reluctant to speak about whaling?\n\nOh, I have had a lot of journalists on border ship and there are many bad journalists who only want to have the big scoop, you know, want us to say something they could put together so they could make a scoop or something like that. A lot of journalists are very bad. That's a pity. When I watch the news, I have a big question, science, is this true or not? Because I, I've experienced many bad journalists, but also some good, I think people, the whalers are fed up with the bad journalists who only want to have a scoop.\n\nAnd when you say they wanna scoop, what does that mean? It means they wanna make you look bad. It means they wanna make you look like you don't have morals.\n\nYeah, something like that.\n\nDo you think whaling will still exist in Norway in 10 years?\n\nYes.\n\nWhat about 50 years,\n\nThen it'll be more. It has to be,\n\nYou say it has to be to protect the fish stock, you say Yes.\n\nAnd to produce food enough for the people on the planet.\n\nIs there anything we didn't talk about that we should? Is there anything I didn't ask you that I should have or anything you just want to tell me about? No, no, it's enough. You've had enough of me. Yes.\n\nI hope people in United States will understand that it's to hunt an animal. It's not a nice thing to do, but it's necessary. It's good food. It's not nice to see a cow being killed, not even a chicken, to never get allowed to see that the Micky whale have a a nice free life before he, he meet me, then it's over.\n\nAlright, Bjorn, thank you very much.
