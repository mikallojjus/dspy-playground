      "transcript_chunk": "es the complete opposite. No, we want the full expression that fits different human brains such that it seems like the language is guessing just what they want.\n\nAnd part of that is also you described the principle of Lisa Prize, which is a difficult thing to engineer into a language because you have to kind of, it's a subjective thing. What is,\n\nWhich is why you can't do it in one way, which is why I used the example of both Exit and Quit. The principle of Lisa Surprise for some people would be like, oh, exit. That's how I get out of the prompt. For other people it'd be quit. Why don't we just do both?\n\nOkay, so what's the convention over configuration? That's a big one.\n\nThat's a big one. That's a huge one. And it was born out of a frustration I had in the early days with especially Java frameworks, where when you were setting up a web application framework for Java back in the day, it was not uncommon to literally write hundreds if not thousands of lines of XML configuration files. Oh, I need this, I want the database to use the foreign keys as Post id. No, no, no. I wanted As post capital ID, oh, no, no, no, you have to do it. Capital PID. There are all these ways where you can configure how foreign relation keys should work in a database and none of them matter. We just need to pick one and then that's fine.\n\nAnd if we pick one and we can depend on it, it becomes a convention. And if it's a convention, we don't have to configure it. And if we don't have to configure it, you can get started with you actually care about much quicker. So convention of Configuration is essentially to take that idea that the system should come preassembled. I'm not just handing you a box of fucking Legos and asking you to build the Millennium Falcon. I'm giving you a finished toy. You can edit, you can change it, it's still build out a Legos. You can still take some pieces off and put in some other pieces, but I'm giving you the final product. And this cuts against the grain of what most programmers love. They love a box of Legos. They love to put everything together from scratch. They love to make all these detailed little decisions that just don't matter at all.\n\nAnd I want to elevate that up such that, hey, I'm not trying to take the decisions away from you, I just want you to focus on decisions that actually matter that you truly care about. No one cares about whether it's post under ID or Post ID or Pit.\n\nYeah, great. Defaults,\n\nYes.\n\nIt's just a wonderful thing. You have all these aspirations, they're gonna do some kind of custom, most beautiful Legos castle that nobody's ever built from these pieces. But in reality, to be productive in most situations, you just need to build the basic thing and and then on top of that is where your creativity comes.\n\nAbsolutely. And I think this is one of those, part of the doctrine that a lot of programmers who get to use Ruby on Rails, begrudgingly will acknowledge it's a nice thing, even if they don't really like it, like it's hard to beat the sort of attraction to building with Legos from scratch out of programmers. That's just what we like. This is why we're programmers in the first place because we'd like to put these little pieces together, but we can direct that instinct towards a more productive end of the stack. Okay.\n\nWhat are some of the other ones?\n\nThe menu is on casa. It actually comes out of the same principle that great defaults really matter. If you look at everything that's wrong with the JavaScript ecosystem right now, for example, it is that no one is in charge of the menu. There are a billion different dishes and you can configure just your tailored specific configuration of it, but no one done the work to make sure it all fits together. So you have all these unique problems in the JavaScript ecosystem, for example, there's probably 25 major ways of just doing the controller layer and then as many of how to talk to the database. So you get this permutation of end times, end times n of no one is using the same thing.\n\nAnd if they are using the same thing, they're only using the same thing for about five minutes. So we have no retained wisdom. We build up no durable skills. Rails goes the complete opposite way of saying, do you know what Rails is not just a framework, it is a complete attempt at solving the web problem. It's complete attempt at solving everything you need to build a great web application. And every piece of that puzzle should ideally be in the box pre-configured, preassembled. If you wanna change some of those pieces later, that's wonderful, but on day one you'll get a full menu designed by a chef who really cared about every piece of the ingredient and you're gonna enjoy it.\n\nAnd that's again, one of those things where many programmers think like I know better, and they do in some hyper local sense of it. Every programmer knows better. This is what Ruby is built on, that every programmer knows better in their specific situation. Maybe they can do something dangerous, maybe they think they know better and then they blow their foot off and then they truly will know better because they've blown their foot off once and won't do it again. But the the menu is a macas. Is that so\n\nYou in general see the value in the In the monolith?\n\nYes. The integrated system. Integrated system that someone thought of the whole problem. This is one of the reasons why I've been on a crusade against microservices since the term was coined. Microservices was born out of essentially a good idea. What do you do at Netflix scale when you have thousands of engineers working on millions of lines of code? No one can keep that entire system in their head at one time. You have to break it down. Microservices can be a reasonable way to do that when you're at Netflix scale, when you apply that pattern to a team of 20 programmers working on a code base of half a million lines of code, you're an idiot. You just don't need turn invocation into network calls it the first rule of distributed programming, do not distribute your programming.\n\nIt is makes everything harder. All the failure conditions you have to consider as a programmer just becomes infinitely harder when there's a network cable involved. So I hate the idea of premature decomposition and microservices is exactly that. The monolith says, let's try to focus on building a whole system that a single human can actually understand and push that paradigm as far as possible by compressing all the concepts. Just that more of it will fit into memory of a single operating human. And then we can have a system where I can actually understand all of base camp. I can actually understand all of hay. Both of those systems are just over a hundred thousand lines of code. I've seen people do this that maybe twice, maybe three times that scale and then it starts breaking down once you get north of certainly half a million lines of code.\n\nNo individual human can do it, and that's when you get into maybe some degree of microservices can make sense.\n\nBasecamp and Hay are both a hundred\n\nThousand, a hundred thousand lines of code thereabouts.\n\nWow, that's small.\n\nIt's considering the fact that Basecamp, I think has something like 420 screens, different ways and configurations even.\n\nDo you include the front end in that?\n\nNo, that's the Ruby code. Well, it's front end in the sense that some of that Ruby Codes, it's beneficial to the to the front, but it's not JavaScript for example. Now the other thing we might talk about later is we write very little JavaScript actually for all of our applications. Hey, which is a Gmail competitor. Gmail ships, I think 28 megabytes of uncompressed JavaScript. If you compress it, I think think it's about six megabytes, 28 megabytes. Think about how many lines of code that is. When Hay launched, we shipped 40 kilobytes.\n\nYeah,\n\nIt's trying to solve the same problem. You can solve the email client problem with either 28 megabytes of uncompressed JavaScript or with 40 kilobytes if you do things differently. Yeah, but that comes through the same problem essentially. This is why I have fiercely fought splitting front end and back end. Apart that, in my opinion, this was one of the great crimes against web development. Yeah. That we are still atoning for that we separated and divided what was and should be a unified problem solving mechanism. When you are working both on front end and backend, you understand the whole system and you're not going to get into these camps that decompose and eventually you end up with shit like GraphQL.\n\nOkay, let's fly through the rest of the doctrine. No one paradigm,\n\nNo one paradigm goes to the fact that Ruby is a fiercely object-oriented programming language at its core, but it's also a functional program language. This five times I told you about, you can essentially do these anonymous function calls and you can chain 'em together very much in the spirit of how true functional programming languages work. Ruby has even moved closer towards the functional programming and of the scale by making strings immutable. There are ideas from all different disciplines of, and all different paradigms of software development that can fit together. Small talk, for example, was only object oriented and that was just it. Ruby tries to be mainly object oriented, but borrow a little bit of functional programming, a little bit of imperative programming, be able to do all of that.\n\nRails tries to do the same thing. We're not just gonna pick one paradigm and run it through everything. Object orientation is at the center of it, but it's okay to invite all these other disciplines and it's okay to be inspired. It's okay to remix it. I actually think one of the main benefits of Rails is that it's a remix. I didn't invent all these ideas. I didn't come up with active record. I didn't come up with the NBC way of dividing an application. I took all the great ideas that I had learned and picked up from every different camp and I put it together not because there was gonna be just one single overarching theory of everything, but I was gonna have a cohesive unit that incorporated the best from everywhere.\n\nIs that idea a bit a tension with the beauty of the monolith system?\n\nI think the monolith can be thought of as quite roomy, quite as a big tent that the monolith needs actually to borrow a little bit of functional programming for the kinds of problems that that excels, that discipline excels at solving and that paradigm excels at solving. If you also want object orientation at its core, I actually think when I've looked at functional programming languages, there's a lot to love. And then I see some of the crazy contortions they have to go through when part of the problem they're solving calls for mutating something and you go like, holy shit, this is a great paradigm from 90% of the problem.\n\nAnd then you're twisting yourself completely outta shape when you try to solve the last 10. Ooh,\n\nExalt Beautiful code is the next one.\n\nWe've talked about that at length and here's a great example that really summarizes the domain specific language quality of Ruby on Rails that you can make code actually pleasant to write and read. Which is really funny to me because as we talked about when I started learning programming, it wasn't even a consideration. I didn't even know that that could be part of the premise, that that could be part of the solution. That writing code could feel as good as writing a poem\n\nClass project, application record belongs to account has many participants. Class name person validates presence of name.\n\nSee, you could read it out. You didn't even change\n\nAnything. It's like a haiku or something, right?\n\nIsn't that beautiful? Yeah,\n\nIt's nice. It's really, it's really, it's really nice. There's a, there's an intuitive nature to it. Okay, so I have specific questions there. I mean active record, just to take that tangent, that has to be your favorite feature.\n\nIt's the crown jewel of rails. It really is. It's the defining characteristic of how to work with Ruby on Rails. Yeah, and it's born in an interesting level of controversy because it actually uses a pattern that had been described by Martin Fowler in the patterns of enterprise application architecture. One of the greatest books for anyone working on business systems. And if you had not read it, you must pick it up immediately. Patterns of enterprise application architecture, I think it was published in 2001. It is one of the very few programming books that I have read many times over. It's incredible in it. Martin describes a bunch of different patterns of how to build business systems essentially.\n\nAnd active record is a little bit of a footnote in there. The pattern is literally called active record. You can look it up in this Nice, it's called Active. Very good. I wasn't even creative enough to come up with a name of my own. But it allows the creation, the marriage of database and object orientation in a way that a lot of programmers find a little off-putting. They don't actually want to pollute the beautiful object-oriented nature of that kind of programming with sql. There was a rant by Uncle Bob the other day about how SQL is the worst thing ever, blah blah. Ah, okay, fine, whatever. I don't care. This is practical. We are making CRUD applications.\n\nYou're taking things out of an HCML form and you're sticking 'em into a damn database. It's not more complicated than that. The more abstractions you put in between those two ends of the spectrum, the more you're just fooling yourself. This is what we're doing. We're talking to SQL databases. By the way, quick aside, SQL was one of those things that have endured the onslaught of no SQL databases structured list data for a better part of a decade and still reign Supreme SQL was a good thing to invest your time in learning. Every program I'm working with the web should know SQL to a fair degree. Even if they're working with an ORM, an object relational map or as active record, you still need to understand sql.\n\nWhat Active Record does is not so much try to abstract the SQL away behind a different kind of paradigm. It's just making it less cumbersome to write, making it more amenable to build domain models on top of other domain models in ways that you don't have to write every damn sequel statement by hand. We'll just\n\nSay the active record is an ORM. Yes. Which is a layer that makes it intuitive and human interpretable to communicate with a database\n\nEven simpler than that. It turns tables into classes and rows into objects. I actually think SQL is very easy to understand Most of it. You can write some SQL golf too. That's very hard to understand. But SQL at its base, and much of the criticism against SQL was it was written for human consumption. It's actually quite verbose, especially if you're doing things like inserts over and over again. It's quite ose insert into table parentheses, enumerate every column you want to insert values, parentheses, every value that fits with that column. It gets tedious to write sequel by hand, but it's actually very humanly readable. Active record just takes that tediousness away.\n\nIt makes it possible to combine things in a way that a humanly describable language just doesn't. It composes things into methods and you can combine these methods and you can build structures around them. So I don't dislike sql, I dislike a lot of things in programming. I try to get rid of them. SQL wasn't really one of them, it was just a sense of I don't wanna write the same thing over and over again. It was a, can we be a little more succinct? Can we match it just slightly better to the object orientation without trying to hide away the fact that we're persisting these objects into a database. That's where I think a lot of ORMs went wrong. They tried to live in the pure world of objects, never to consider that.\n\nThose objects had to be consistent into a SQL database.",

      "transcript_chunk": "l, is that it's a very humane place in a lot of ways. The funding is not what it was. Let's get that straight right now in England, anywhere the arts are underfunded. It's bad it everywhere.\n\nAlthough here there's much more from the state,\n\nMuch, much more. And I'm sure that's going to be more pronounced once we lose, you know, our National Endowment of the arts, which will probably happen very soon in America. So that's absolutely true. I think there's a theater culture here that does not exist in America in general. There's a certain kind of value placed on the arts in England. And that is the thing about this tradition, right? We're part of a history. This is part of how we do things. It's very codified and there's constricting elements of that and then there's very wonderful elements to it. So you really do feel that that theater going is part of our culture. And that's why like, you know, in the royal court, they have seats in the bleachers for like 10 pence so everyone can come. 'cause it's part of the democracy that is part of the democracy.\n\nThat's how the Greeks thought of it as well.\n\nI thought of you and this play the other day we were up in Chester, England. It's an old Roman city. They've still got intact Roman walls and there's a thousand year old cathedral. And while we were there, we went to the races. The oldest horse racing track in the world is there. It's almost 500 years old. It's fun. And it's also weirdly identical to what it must have been almost 500 years ago. You've got animals, you've got people on them. And other than like the hats that the ladies wear, they call fascinators them being made of things that I'm sure materials that didn't exist 500 years ago. Otherwise it's pretty much the same. I was thinking that that's a tradition that carries on.\n\nMaybe it's because it's a form of entertainment where you can also bet, but it's social. Right? People get together in the sunshine you drink. And I was thinking about, well theater, you know, the same time that Chester was happening, like Shakespeare probably went to the Chester race course at some point, right? And I'm just thinking about the trajectories of these two things in some ways are very similar. They're analog things that are events. But the theater, sadly to me, and I gather to you as what would seem to be a different trajectory going forward, what do you think is lost for humankind?\n\nOh my God, listen, I'm a playwright, so clearly I like it. I think there are a lot of bad plays. I think it's a very hard medium. I think some of the curators are a little bit boring. But I think in terms of people getting together in a shared space and having a collective experience, it can be breathtakingly beautiful and important. And you know, again, I go back to the earliest democracies. I mean, it was a democratic requirement to go to the theater in ancient Greece, not for women. 'cause they weren't considered people or slaves, but still, okay. There was this idea that theater and democracy, they go together\n\nAnd the theater was often about the ideas of the day. It wasn't pure entertainment, we should say. Yes. Yeah,\n\nThere were ideas of the day, but then it was also, who knows? People were stabbing each other and killing the sheep and going crazy. I guess those are the ideas of the day. We're all going mad. But you know, there was a kind of psychic penetration that those plays engaged. There was a shadow side of human behavior and what it meant to be part of a social contract and also to be a leader of some kind or to be disenfranchised. Those are the plays that really move and interest me. Sometimes we go into phases of history where boulevard plays, I guess they're called, that are just lovely and entertaining and kind of throwaway, but fine in the moment, become more the order of the day.\n\nAnd then I think there are moments in history where the work can get more difficult.\n\nSpeaking of work that can be difficult. The street that we're on today, old Compton in soho, central London. Do you happen to know anything about who lived on the street in the past?\n\nGay people?\n\nI'm guessing that.\n\nThat's all I know. It's like a gay\n\nArea. Yeah, I'm guessing that's true.\n\nWho lived here?\n\nWell, many people. But the most noteworthy when I looked up was Wagner Ricard Wagner lived here.\n\nOh my God.\n\nI asked my favorite AI search engine what Wagner and David Ame have in common. Oh\n\nNo, we're both control freaks.\n\nDidn't gimme that. It may not know you well enough yet. It says David Ame and Rahar Wagner shares several notable commonalities rooted in their contributions to the performing arts. You like it so far? This is crazy. Particularly in how they both innovated within their respective mediums. Okay, so this is legit. Ready? There are four pioneering theatrical storytelling required. Wagner as a composer and Libre assist to revolutionize opera with this concept of that word. I can never say Guam. Yeah, yeah, I love that. And David Ame as a contemporary playwright known for pushing the boundaries of dramatic form and content. I don't know what you call the face you just made. It's all\n\nRight. It's like a Jewish fa. It's like by Larry David.\n\nOkay, if you say so. Number two, focus on music as central to their work. Okay, not a bad point. I mean, he was a musician, but okay. Number three, exploration of artistic process and creative tension. Wagner's works often depict artists, gods and mortals struggling with creation, ambition, and interpersonal conflict. While ame stereophonics similarly dramatizes the intense, often fraught dynamics. And number four, influence and controversy. Both have attracted controversy, Wagner fors, personal views, and the revolutionary nature of his art admi for legal disputes over the sources and inspirations for plays including Stereophonic and its alleged parallels to Fleetwood Macs history.\n\nSo, all\n\nRight.\n\nThat's what the AI machine has to say about you and Wagner. What do you think?\n\nNo comment.\n\nCan you gimme some kind of response to this? The lawsuit that the AI brings up? This was a Fleetwood Mac adjacent lawsuit. There was a settlement. I understand. Say what you can or will.\n\nI can't say anything. You know, I'm not a lamp. We settled it. I'm so glad we settled it.\n\nThe play did not have to change as a result of the lawsuit, I assume, or am I wrong? No. Was there a serious concern at some point that you might have to either shut down the show or rewrite\n\nParts? Well, we couldn't do anything with the lawsuit hanging over us. We wouldn't have been able to go to London or do a tour or anything like that. It was too\n\nFraught. I know the settlement amount is not made public as it never is in these cases, but I would assume that might have been a contribution to why it took a little while to recoup. Yeah, a chunk must have gone there.\n\nI mean, I don't think I'm allowed to say, but no,\n\nThe case had been brought by Ken Klay, a producer and engineer who worked on Fleetwood Max record rumors and who wrote a memoir called Making Rumors. There are, as I mentioned earlier, a lot of Fleetwood Mac parallels in Stereophonic from the makeup of the band itself to the way that the Peter character like Lindsay Buckingham in real life winds up taking over the project. There's also the fact that both Peter and Lindsay have a brother who's an Olympic swimmer. But now that the lawsuit has been cleared, Stereophonic is playing in London with sold out houses and rave reviews, and there will be a US tour later this year. I'm Steven Dubner.

Edward Jones, member, SIPC.\n\nSo what's different about the London production of Stereophonic from the New York production? The\n\nCast is, three of them came from New York and they all had the option to come, but the rest of 'em said, no, we don't wanna come. Okay. So we recast it.\n\nOh, they all did have the option.\n\nThey all had the option. Listen, it's a very, very draining play to do. They were just like, we've done it. We came out in January and we recast the farther roles and it was very, very hard because it's not just about getting people to play instruments and who are good actors. They have to feel a certain way. I mean, I really cast for the quality first and then it's like, okay, how can you act and can you play instruments?\n\nWhat do you mean cast for quality? First\n\nI wanted people who felt like artists and that they were a little bit weird. I didn't want people that felt like actors. A lot of actors are really good actors, but they feel like actors acting. I didn't want that for this show, and I really wanted to give the audience a very easy ramp into the kind of naturalism that we're asking in the play. And we found these actors, but there were like one or two like, okay, you could play that role. You're the only one. You could do it\n\nIn all of England,\n\nKind of. But that's what happened in in America too.\n\nSeveral cast members of Stereophonic in New York weren't really musicians. Tom Ppaca, who played the Peter character, had told me that before he started training for rehearsals, he only played what he called garbage guitar. But some of the London cast members are experienced musicians\n\nAt Playwright's Horizons. It was like, you know, what's that movie where they were getting the ship up the Hill\n\nFitzcarraldo?\n\nThat's what that was. It was a little bit like, oh my God, this is gonna kill me. Whereas, you know, three days in, they were playing all the songs and then it sounded great. They're musicians. They can do this\n\nWith zero disparagement toward American cast. Would it have been a different experience had you cast actors who were also musicians for the American version? I'm\n\nSure it would've been different. Would it have been better? Not necessarily because so much of the charm and the deliciousness of that experience was the meta story of can we make ourselves a band? Can we do this? Can we play instruments? It was wild seeing them step up to that plate for Will Brill, to learn how to play bass, and for Tom to learn the riff for Masquerade.\n\nThey\n\nWere so petrified, but inside of that fear was a kind of laser focus, like a minute to win it, and it brought out something very primal and thrilling that made its way into the performance. So I actually think it helps us in a certain way.\n\nI understand there's a new song for the London production. Yeah.\n\nIt's not in the production, in the play. Diana speaks about this song, which is from the first album, and it's the song that starts creeping back up the charts and then propels their album into success. So Will said, I'm gonna write that song, and then he said, I'm gonna give the cast something to do that's their own, to let the British cast shine for themselves and they kill it.\n\nI read that Brad Pitt's film production company is acquired rights to Stereo phonic. True.\n\nI don't know if they acquired the Rights. They're just my producers for the film, which I'm writing right now.\n\nOh, so you're writing\n\nThe film? I'm writing the film. I just decided not to sell it to a studio quite yet because I'd like to take my time and get it right and not have to take notes. Part of the problem is like, okay, you like the play now. What do you imagine the Hollywood version of it to be? I don't even know what it is yet. I have to redo the whole thing in my mind. Is\n\nThis gonna take another 10 years roughly?\n\nI hope to God not. I mean, I am working on it right now and I can't rush it, but I don't wanna do a bad movie and I really want it to have the integrity that the play had, but it can't be a play.\n\nCan you give a couple ideas just of how the film would be different from the play?\n\nI can't talk too much about the film 'cause I don't wanna jinx it. There are talkie speeches that will never be in this film. I love them and they're central to the play and they can't have anything to do with it. There's a character who is alluded to this receptionist who is an aspiring singer model person who sort of works her way through the band, who becomes a character in the film. I love writing her. It's a big thing in the play. This demarcation between public and private, those spaces are quite collapsed in the play. Everything becomes public 'cause they're just in the studio and there's no escape.\n\nIt's inspiring to me that you're so confident about this because it's a different kind of writing.\n\nIt's totally different and you have to embrace it, but I don't have an ego about it all, so I think that's where playwrights get in trouble, like, oh, my wonderful play. It's like, no, no, I've gotta kill. It's like Oedipus, kill the play. Marry the movie. You know what I mean? That's how I'm approaching it. I can't deify this play. This play is its own thing and there's things that I'm gonna keep because they're gonna work in the movie, but I have to figure out the proportions and stuff. It's just different. What\n\nAbout other plays? What are you working on?\n\nI'm doing a play for the public theater that I can't really talk about. It's a two part play.\n\nIs it contemporary? It\n\nIs, but it also spans something like 50 years. It's very different from Stereophonic. It couldn't be more different and I can't talk about it. I can't. I'm gonna get in trouble.\n\nDoes it engage more with the outside world than Stereophonic does, whether that's political engagement or whatnot? Yeah,\n\nIt does, but not because I felt an obligation to. I think that's where artists get into trouble when they're being pointed. Oh, let me write about the issue of the day because it's very important and I need to speak to it. I never do that. I don't like those kind of plays, and yet I've written one. Despite the fact that I dislike it. It came from a place of obsession and not understanding what I was examining. That's when I trust myself. When I'm coming from a place of rational inquiry, that's when I know I'm on the wrong track.\n\nI've heard you talk about this notion of an event, a thing that happens in a given place in time and that there's less and less appreciation of that, and I will say as a human, that worries me a little bit because we've lived the entirety of our civilization with that notion, so I don't know.",

      "transcript_chunk": "ack on all of us.\n\nThat was really smart, and it produced with all of the incredible imperfections, nonetheless, 80 extraordinary years of progress.\n\nWhen you talk about enlightened self-interest, it makes me think of, there was a, a Nobel Prize speech given by Bertrand Russell, the British philosopher. This was in 1950. He talked about there were four drivers, four key drivers of all human action. They are acquisitiveness, rivalry, vanity and love of power. Nowhere on that list is enlightened self-interest. Yeah, so I guess I'm getting to a a more basic or philosophical question, which has to do with the nature of humankind, and this also might connect us to a conversation about the famous Francis Fukuyama argument about the end of history, which basically declared that democracy has won, and in the decades since then, we've seen obviously a return to a political style in many countries that looks much more like the might is right argument versus the enlightened self-interest model.\n\nDo, do you feel then that you and I and many others had the fortune to be born into that period where there was a relative moderation, but that now we're returning to the natural state of punching each other in the nose and taking what we can?\n\nYes, but the notion that, you know, life is nasty, brutish, and short has real salience. It may be, and there's one theory of history that the natural state of things is not what we experienced broadly speaking over the last 80 years. That nasty brutish in short is more the norm, that poverty is more the norm than productivity and progress, and that it is only through exceptional decisions and endeavors that we can break out of the norm.\n\nDo you buy that argument or are you saying, no, we superseded it?\n\nNo, I, I guess I see it differently, and I think looking at the extraordinary sweep of history, it does seem to me that we've been on an arc of progress, albeit one that sometimes bends in the wrong direction and occasionally breaks. The question is whether that arc can continue and we can try to make sure that when it's under incredible strain as it will be in this period, it doesn't break.\n\nI'm guessing, you know the work of scholars, Tom Shelling and others Yeah, who've argued over the years that for many, many, many generations, civilization really was built around competition and conflict, right? There weren't many resources, so you fought over them, but then we've entered a period where we know how to make stuff at scale. We know how to grow food at scale, and so you would think that we would've transitioned over into a period of collaboration and cooperation versus competition and so on, but it feels to me as if we've retreated from that.\n\nI don't think this is zero sum choice. Competition's a good thing. It's the basis of our system. It's a driver of progress, I think done right, done fairly. It tends to bring out the best in people. Certainly, I think that's been the experience in the United States, so I don't see it as being detrimental or undermining of collaboration, cooperation, and non-zero sum outcomes. On the contrary, yes, you've gotta have often individual ingenuity and innovation, but so many of these things to be successful are collective enterprises. For example, I was talking about the extraordinary engine for innovation and progress that the United States has been since the end of World War ii.\n\nAt the start of the 20th century, there was no branch of science in which the United States led the world. Hmm. At the start of the 21st century, there was no branch of science in which the United States did not lead the world. How did that happen? I think it happened because some profoundly smart decisions were made about the country and how it should operate mostly after the Second World War. Maybe the most important among them was this extraordinary public private partnership between the government, private sector, and especially our universities. By about a year ago, we had something like 3.5% of our GDP that was dedicated to research and development, a trillion dollars a year, 40% of that coming from the federal government and much of that going to universities to make these advances.\n\nWe've managed to be this extraordinary pole of attraction for the most talented people in the world who come here, think here, invent here, create here, and many stay here, which is what we want. I was really struck by something the other day. You saw that Mark Zuckerberg went on this extraordinary, what do you call it?\n\nHiring spree,\n\nBuying spree, hiring spree to find the best possible talent for ai. He wound up bringing in 11 extraordinary talents. I was kind of curious about it because I saw their names and it really jumps out at you. It's not John Smith, the 11 people. They're from China, they're from India, they're from the uk, they're from South Africa, they're from Australia. Each one of them an immigrant to this country. Each one of them, I believe, came here to pursue academic studies, research work, and now they are in the vanguard of what in a positive sense, is going to carry our society and our civilization forward.\n\nThat is AI for good, but if we wind up in a place where that talent no longer comes here because it can't or doesn't want to, what are we going to be condemning ourselves to\n\nComing up after the break? What are we condemning ourselves to and can a 19th century worldview work in the 21st?

The president never\n\nMet him.\n\nI've not met him. Of course, I know many people who know him and look, I think the President has extraordinary instincts when it comes to the American people, and he taps into that very powerfully. Maybe the most important economy that we have now is the attention economy and his ability to dominate that economy is a source of great strength and great power.\n\nI mean, those are fairly faint praises with which you're damning him in terms of bigger thinking, strategic thinking, political alliances and so on. I know you're too polite to give him a failing grade, but no, I just\n\nHave a very different worldview as I try to understand where President Trump is going and how he sees the world. I think it's an interesting combination of the 19th century and the 1980s. By which I mean this, the president seems to, this is not a secret respect. First and foremost people. He perceives as strong leaders in strong countries, and maybe until very recently, that was Vladimir Putin, Xi Jinping. Maybe it's Erdogan in Turkey, maybe it's the Crown Prince in Saudi Arabia in that worldview, and in the 19th century, remember we had spheres of influence. The big guys, and I mean, guys got to basically run things in their part of the world.\n\nRegional hegemons,\n\nRegional hegemons, and in that view, Russia would be one, and so what it does in its part of the world, including Ukraine, that's its business. China would be another with the exception, and this gets to the 1980s piece of economic and trade issues because I think the president does have a B and his bonnet about that. They get to do whatever they want in their part of the world, which is why I do have concerns about what does this mean for Taiwan? What does it mean for Chinese expansionism in the South China Sea, and we get to do what we want in our part? Maybe that's Greenland. Maybe that's Canada. Maybe that's the Panama Canal. What's interesting about that, Stephen, is that yes, in the 19th century actually having the land, owning the land, dominating the land was important.\n\nThat's no longer the case. That's not necessary. You can cut a deal, you can make an agreement to get the benefits you want without actually having to take over the country or or the land. Just as in Greenland, we've got a really important military base. We have access through trade and commercial relations to whatever raw materials can actually be gotten from there. It's a really difficult climate, so I think there's that view. The 1980s pieces, I, again, coming up in New York, in that period, Japan Inc. The perception that we were being ripped off to use a diplomatic term, taken advantage of, and maybe there's the real estate piece too, which was very zero sum. You're in a deal. You're either a winner or you're a loser. That's very antithetical to the, well I was talking about earlier, enlightened self-interest in the notion that actually, no, you wanna strive for win-wins and that others doing well means actually you can do better.\n\nWhat I worry about is this, yes, others may have to make an accommodation one time around. Maybe they have to give in on something to avoid a tariff, but then what's the likely motivation and instinct going to be? It's going to be instead of figuring out with us how to de-risk from China, it's going to be de-risk from the United States. How do we make sure that we're not in a position where the whims, the material nature of us policy puts us at risk, and that means trying to find ways to work around or away from the United States to ban together. One of the things that we also avoided after World War II was what typically happens when one power emerges dominant over others, which is everyone else gets together.\n\nThey bandwagon to try to hold it in check because of enlightened self-interest, because we tried to create a rules-based order, however, imperfectly where we bound ourselves again, imperfectly to the same rules as others, we constrained our own power. We avoided what usually happens that bandwagoning, I'm afraid now we're actually going to see that if we continue on on this course.\n\nOn the other hand, all of a sudden NATO seems to be quite fond of Donald Trump, at least. You know, as of this conversation a few weeks ago, there was that amazing press conference, which I'm guessing you saw then the, the statement from Mark Ruta, and it seems as though, I mean, my reading of that, and I'm probably wrong, so I'd love you to tell me, but it seems as though Trump, by making himself the least bad of the strong men, has made himself appealing to the European NATO community. What do you see there?\n\nLet's put this in perspective first. There's this whole question of, you know, are our allies spending enough on defense? The president complained a lot during his first term about free riders and how we're picking up all of the, the burden. There was a kernel of truth to that, to state the obvious, but here's the reality. Back in 2014, all of the NATO countries came together at one of their summits in Wales and they said, we're all gonna spend 2% of GDP on defense. That was the mark that they set for themselves. When President Trump left office, a grand total of nine of our allies were spending the 2% of GDP.\n\nOut of how many?\n\nOut of, at that point, 30, by the time President Biden left office, 23 of the allies were spending 2%. So pretty big difference between the nine at the end of Trump won and the 23 at the end of Biden. I think this is very positive. The agreement that came out of that summit was that all allies agreed that the goal would now be to spend 5% of GDP on defense, which is a pretty extraordinary number. We spend about 3.5%, but I have to say, if I really want to give credit to anyone, it's less President Trump or less, for that matter, president Biden, than it is President Putin.\n\nYes, a dark way of looking at the accomplishment, but I understand now, Donald Trump has been discussed as a potential winner of the Nobel Peace Prize. I'm guessing you've read about that somewhere. I'm curious how much Biden thought about winning the Nobel Peace Prize?\n\nI never heard him talk about it. I don't think that was, at least to my knowledge, what motivated him.\n\nYou think it's in the back of the mind of any president?\n\nOh, I I, I, look, I imagine it is. It's just as I think about it, I can't remember hearing him talk about it, so that doesn't mean it wasn't there.\n\nNow, you were in the Obama White House when Obama won the Peace Prize in 2009, which was his first year in office, and a lot of people thought it was, you know, kind of nuts.\n\nOh, I think President Obama was probably first among them. I think he recognized that this was, in a sense, a triumph of hope,\n\nA down payment, maybe.\n\nMaybe a down payment, what could be, what people hope would be, and I think his speech, which is remarkable, reflected that I'd urge people to go back and and read it. I think it actually does a very good job of grappling with the world as it is, including what we were talking about a little bit earlier, what is the actual state of nature and how do we think about that? But no, I think he recognized that it was, yes, as you would say, a down payment.\n\nI wanna ask about a lunch you had with President Biden a few weeks after his debate with Trump. This was his disastrous debate, which ultimately led to his deciding not to run, but with a lot of chaos. In the interim. What I've read is that at this lunch, you said to him, look, everybody gets remembered in one sentence, and it sounded as if, from what I've read, that you were cautioning him. You don't want your sentence to be old man becomes senile while sitting in the White House. I want you to walk us through that. I want you to give us the most thorough assessment possible of the decline and fall of Joe Biden while understanding that you had long experience and great loyalty and great affection and admiration for him.\n\nYou were among the closest to him. You were among the few who toured, the end was still getting his prime hours.\n\nSo first, the conversations we had, the exchanges we had, those are things that I try to keep to my myself. I've seen some of these accounts, and I don't wanna say much more than that. Here's what I can say, and I'll give you my best judgment first, when it comes to how to evaluate the president, his tenure, what he did and how he did it, I think it's actually pretty simple. Look at the policies the administration pursued. Look at what we did, and then be the judge. You may like it or you may not like it, but the reason I say that is every single one of those decisions and of those judgments was his, not me, not some other cabinet secretary, not some senior advisor.\n\nHis, and I can tell you from my own experience at least, but when it comes to foreign policy, this is where, of course, I was engaged with him on everything that we did. We had the most robust of debates, discussions, arguments that he drove.\n\nLet me ask you this.",

      "transcript_chunk": "interview with them after two hours and you felt that you have been boxing almost physically exhausted, but generally for an industry that thrives in secrecy, a lot of the all hands were quite open and willing to tell stories that often you couldn't believe.\n\nIt sounds like you're saying they are willing because what they did was kind of extraordinary.\n\nThese people who were retired, they were telling you deals that they did in Angola in 1975 or on Cuba in 1985 or in the Soviet Union after the collapse of the Berlin Wall. They were very proud of what they did and how they made money. Also, it was a bit of a different world where perhaps corruption was not seen as is today. These were executives which made business in very difficult corners of the wall, and they were operating from Switzerland, a country that not only allow companies to pay bribes overseas, but allow companies to deduct the payments as a tax credit.\n\nBribes were tax deductible in Switzerland until about a decade ago.\n\nTo understand how Switzerland became the epicenter of this industry, it helps to understand a commodity trader named Mark Rich Bloss and Farci write about Rich a good bit in their book. There's also a very good Mark Rich biography called The King of Oil by Danielle Aman. At least the chapters I read were very good. Here's Farci again.\n\nMark Rich was the godfather of the modern commodity trading industry to a significant extent invented the industry. Rich was born into a Jewish family in Belgium in the 1930s like many other Jews in Europe in the 1930s, and like many of the people who had go on to be big players in the commodity trading industry moved to the US because of the rise of Nazism in Europe in the post-war period, got his apprenticeship at Philip Brothers Fibo, which was in the 1950s and 1960s, the dominant force in commodity trading and really kind of invented a lot of the ways in which commodity traders do business and make money. But there was something gentleman Lee and genteel in Philip Brothers and Mark Rich was this super aggressive, totally driven, always focused entirely on money and nothing else.\n\nCharacter Philip Brothers was too small for him. In\n\n1974, rich and his trading partner, Pinkus Pinky Green left Philip brothers to form their own firm, which would become a powerhouse. It was called Mark Rich and Co.\n\nHe got his big break when the oil market began to fragment and the seven sisters, these big American, European oil companies, began to lose control of the oil market and he started trading oil with abandon at a time when the tradable oil market was only just becoming a thing. Talk\n\nAbout the ways in which he did things differently from everybody, or maybe another way to put it is the risks he was willing to take, the different actors he was willing to engage with, et cetera. A\n\nLot of what you needed to do to make money in the oil trade in those early days was to have a good enough relationship with one of the big oil producers that they would sell you oil at a price that was probably too low. One of his big trade flows was through this extremely secretive pipeline that went through Israel that was built as a joint venture between Israel and Iran before the fall of the S Shah in great secrecy and Mark Rich would be buying Iranian oil, putting it through the the pipeline, supplying Israel, but also supplying Europe through this pipeline, which then became enormously valuable when the Suez Canal closed in 1967 after Israel launched an attack on Egypt and Syria.\n\nThis brief ward was over, but the Suez Canal stayed closed until 1975 and for Mark Rich, that was a gift from the gods and he made huge amounts of money. Mark Rich became this almost larger than life figure in commodity trading, the most profitable commodity trader ever. We spoke to a number of former senior people at Mark Rich who said that the company made a billion dollars of profit in 1979, the era of the Iranian revolution, which in those days would've made it one of the 10 largest companies in America. And this was a company owned by a small handful of people that only people in the commodities industry had ever heard of, but that didn't last because Mark Rich caught the attention of US law and particularly of Rudy Giuliani, then a prosecutor who indicted him for tax fraud and for trading with Iran during the hostage crisis.\n\nSo he and his partner, pinky Green, fled the US to Switzerland, became fugitives from US Justice, and then carried on their business of being the world's largest commodity trading house, despite this US indictment hanging over their head. And that continued for a number of years. His real undoing came when he lost money in 19 91, 19 92, when one of Mark Rich's zinc traders under the influence of Mark Rich himself attempted to corner zinc market and it went horribly wrong. Mark Rich lost about $170 million on this attempted zinc corner that was really the last straw. His underlings rounded on him and forced him outta the company.\n\nThe company was renamed as Glencore and continues as one of the largest commodity traders. Today,\n\nGlenco is not only the world's largest commodity trader, but it's also a conglomerate. They do everything and anything. They trade a lot of energy, whether is crude oil, natural gas, refined products, a lot of coal. They used to trade a lot of agriculture and they trade a lot of metals and minerals.\n\nIt strikes me that the commodity traders are performing a variety of big functions. They're acting like bankers. They're acting as sort of a government coming in to help another country try to stabilize itself or maybe more like one of the big financial institutions like a World Bank. Can you think of any in history parallels to the functions that these commodity traders were performing? The\n\nCommodity traders look like one of those Swiss knives where you could have everything out of them. They are the bankers of last resort when no one else will take your phone, call for a credit line, they will offer you money. They're the McKinsey, the consultant for lost causes where someone doesn't know how a market works, they will come there and explain it to you, and they're almost like diplomats for hire where you have a foreign affairs problem. They can explain how to make it work. The joke in the oil trading industry was that beetle, the was largest oil trader was the trading arm of MI six, the secret service of James Bond. There is a grain of truth behind that joke.\n\nI can't imagine the same joke doesn't exist for the CIA, correct\n\nThe CIA. I don't think that they have an in-house trading house. However, Philip brothers of fro a big American trading house of the seventies and eighties was known to have very close links to the CIA and just generally, the American government. At times, firo will help American governments, and at times the American government will be a bit surprised to find out that things were happening against the interest of American policy makers and diplomats because Firo was helping the other side\n\nComing up after the break. When the political situation gets turbulent, the commodity traders are often the first people to step into the breach.\n\nThere comes a time where governments need things to happen, where having a commodity trader helping may come handy and where everyone can deny their involvement.\n\nI'm Steven Dubner.

The authors are Javier Bloss and Jack Farci, a pair of financial journalists at Bloomberg. I once had a professor who said that when historians write books, they always search for the big macro thesis, all the different events and populations that contribute to producing whatever it is, a war, a new country or whatever. But that often it really is the product of two people sitting in a room making a deal, having conversation, shaking a hand. To that end, I'd like you to talk about Jamaica for a minute, and the story you tell in your book,\n\nSingle Moments and single deals and single trades can shape the course of history. The Jamaican example was the early 1980s, and this was told to me by a guy called Hugh Hart, who was at the time the Minister for Mines and Energy in the Jamaican government. The Jamaican economy was in pretty tough shape. It was reliant on oil imports and oil prices had surged and the oil crisis and the Jamaican economy was pretty much on its knees. Each month, Jamaica would import about 300,000 barrels of oil,\n\nWhich is like one tanker. Yeah,\n\nIt's one tanker of oil, exactly. By the standards of today's big tankers, a fraction of a tanker, it would import 300,000 barrels of oil, which would go to the refinery in Kingston, and that would supply Jamaica's oil consumption for the month. In order to do that, the central bank would open a letter of credit, which would allow Jamaica to pay for the oil. So Hugh Hart was in his office one Friday afternoon and someone came to see him from the Central Bank in a state of agitation. He said, what's going on? What's the matter? And he said, we've got a problem. The problem is we don't have any money. We can't open the letter of credit. Without that, Jamaica wouldn't be able to buy this cargo of oil.\n\nThey would run out of oil over the weekend, and\n\nThey're literally burning oil for electricity, right? Yeah,\n\nAnd fueling cars. And you know, the petrol stations would run dry and there would be chaos on the streets. This was a fairly febrile time in the Jamaican economy and Jamaican politics, and he thought there would be riots and revolution if they didn't get any oil, and this was a Friday afternoon, so he thought, who do I call? And the only person he could think of to call was Mark Richen Co. The company that is today, Glencore. He called his contact at Mark Rich, who was in New York, who said, I can't help you. I'm a metals trader, but try Mark Rich himself. And so he calls Mark Rich in Switzerland. It's two in the morning. He gets Mark Rich outta bed. Mark Rich says, who are you? What do you want? And he says, well, I'm the minister of energy in Jamaica and I need some oil. And Mark Rich says, huh, okay, call back in an hour.\n\nAnd in that hour, Mark Rich has arranged for a tank of oil that was going from Venezuela to the US to be diverted to Jamaica, delivers the oil, averts the crisis without even a contract being signed without any payment, and saves Jamaica's Day as Hugh Hart told it to me, which is an amazing story of a commodity trader, very likely changing the course of history\n\nBecause there might have been a new government in Jamaica by Tuesday if he hadn't done that.\n\nAbsolutely.\n\nWhat did Mark Rich get out of that?\n\nMark Rich got a very long relationship in Jamaica that made him an awful lot of money. Jamaica was then a really big producer of Illumina, which is the raw material for aluminum. Mark Rich came in and struck a whole series of deals to buy Jamaican Illumina below the global market price and made hundreds of millions of dollars over the years to the point that later Jamaican governments turned around and said, Mark Rich was taking advantage of the country. They were making far too much money and Jamaica was losing out, which probably was true, but at the same time, there was a moment in the early 1980s where Mark Rich saved Jamaica's skin. So this relationship between Mark Rich and Jamaica deepened and took all kinds of interesting turns to the extent that Hugh Hart later on took a portfolio in charge of sport.\n\nAnd when Jamaica was putting together a Bob Slay team for the 1988 Olympics, Mark Rich actually helped to finance this Bob Slay team. That then, of course, became the star of the Disney film Cool Runnings, and that was paid for by Mark Rich.\n\nMark Rich died in 2013, but before he did, he pulled off one more mega deal. He got himself a presidential pardon from Bill Clinton. Critics called this contemptuous. Even Clinton himself would later say he regretted it. So how did commodity traders like Rich come to be so powerful in the first place? In their book, Javier Bloss and Jack Farci point to four key factors since World War II that have shaped the industry. Here's Bloss.\n\nThe first one is Nationalizations of the oil industry, starting from 1950, but really culminating in the 1970s where a lot of Middle East and North African countries took control of their oil destiny, kick out foreign power and nationalize the industries.\n\nSay just a little bit more about the seven Sisters and how the new players came in there.\n\nThe seven sisters were seven vertically integrated American, British, and French companies. That until 1973 dominated the oil market at that point. Typically, a barrel of oil will be produced in an exon oil field, transported in an exon pipeline or an exon tanker into an ex Exxon refinery and an ex Exxon fuel station. Every step of the chain, ex Exxon has its name at the same for bp Shell and what is today total of France at one point, that is broken apart and the companies lose a lot of access to the production and that production is nationalized is not longer the Saudi American oil company, but the Saudi Arabian oil company that does the drilling in Saudi Arabia.\n\nThey have a lot of oil to sell and found that commodity traders were willing to buy the oil and also that they didn't ask too many questions and they were very happy to pay a few bribes in the process. Also, it's a time where oil goes from a rather boring commodity to really a big business. Prices explode. They go from a couple of dollars to $5 to $11 to $30 in the space of about 15 years. A lot of these companies make a lot of money because they replace the traditional vertical integrated oil company with something in between.\n\nThey became the lean between the new very rich, middle East, petro states and the consumers in America and Europe.\n\nOkay. That's the first big factor you identify.",

      "transcript_chunk": "say we are gonna be the most pro-family nation.\n\nAgain,\n\nWhat you just said about family leave being an issue in the pro-life camp makes me think about all the issues that have been historically associated with Democrats, many of which seem to have been quite successfully co-opted by Republicans over the past few years. There's lowering prescription drug prices, paid family leave and other pro-family policies as you mentioned, expanding the child tax credit, even addressing the affordability crisis. Can you talk to me for just a moment about this notion of Republicans co-opting these democratic planks? And I know that there have been plenty of times where Republican planks become Democrat and vice versa, but I want you to speak to that, especially if you don't mind carrying it into the question about what the heck has happened to the Democratic party.\n\nIn other words, if you had all these positions that so many people, including a lot of Republicans are now in favor of what happened?\n\nYeah, well look, if you look at the data, every poll I looked at when you took the names away, Republican, Democrat, Trump, Harris, get all those names and just poll the policies of the candidates. You saw that the policies of the Democratic Party were winning in a much more significant way than the general policies of the Republicans. People ask me all the time, well what's the Democratic party gonna do to save the Democratic party? I say the Democratic Party is more concerned about saving the Democratic party than serving the American people. Then the Democratic party doesn't deserve to be around. This is a moment that we are about to see a generation of leaders step off the stage. The last baby boomer president, the last baby boomer head of the Senate for us Democrats, and this is a time I believe that we need to redeem the American dream.\n\nThis idea that anybody born in any circumstances can make it in America. The very idea of America, we need to make real again.\n\nThere is another democratic position, yours actually promoting what you call baby bonds that is included in Trump's bill but with a new name now it's called Trump accounts. What do you think of that?\n\nYes, God bless the idea behind it that that, that I have been trumpeting for about 10 years. The idea that every kid in America could have an individual investment account that they could watch on their phone. The power of that is transformative. The way they have written it right now benefits the wealthy and hurts the poor.\n\nHow so?\n\nThere are asset limits to qualify for food stamps. There are asset limits to qualify for Medicaid. A poor family who has a thousand dollars or more in the individual investment account can make them ineligible for those important benefits.\n\nYou're saying the money from the baby bond or whatever you wanna call it, would make them ineligible for certain benefits that they'd otherwise receive?\n\nYes. And then another part of it that they don't correct for 'cause our bill was written in a way that was progressive, that the lowest income kids would see some of the greatest benefits. The way they've written it actually is the reverse of that right now. It says that a family could put up to $5,000 into those accounts and enjoy the tax benefits while working families, low income families are not gonna be able to do that. And I'm fine with that, but maybe we should be doing some things to address that. The benefit could be going upwards and I think there's some design elements that could get something like this back on track. If only Donald Trump and others would listen to me in their design, we could correct for some of these failings.\n\nI know you've talked a lot about housing affordability or the lack thereof, which is you know, a big and complicated problem that involves government in many ways. I know there's something in this bill about, I think Mike Lee is most involved in this from Utah has to do with selling off public lands, some of which might be for oil and gas drilling, but some of which might be for development including housing. Now, I don't think Utah has any scarcity of land for housing. I don't know. I'm a New Yorker. Everything seems wide open to me by comparison, but is that a viable way to make more land available for housing and will that actually trigger more housing by selling off more public land?\n\nNo. God no. It's disastrous. I mean this is one of the most outrageously unpopular parts. Taking our most precious shared resource public lands across America and selling them to the highest bidder so that very wealthy people can find ways to exploit that land for greater wealth, not for the country, but greater wealth for themselves. If you want to deal with housing as a guy who doubled the production of affordable housing in his city during the great housing bubble burst, use the bill that I already passed with Tim Scott and we can make it more att tuned to housing called Opportunity Zones. There is so much capital sitting on the sidelines right now that we can incentivize into the investment of affordable housing.\n\nIf you create the right kind of tax incentives, I'm more than happy to give people bigger margins on their profits by creating a tax treatment for people that are investing in affordable housing.\n\nIf you had to bet, do you think that the selling of private lands will get through in the reconciliation or no?\n\nThere are so many people speaking about how bad this bill is. The more the word gets out, the more the backlash is gonna be and the more likely Republicans are gonna say, Nope, get rid of this section. We're already hearing it. Josh Hawley is now screaming about what this could do to rural hospitals. I'm hearing others talk about Medicaid and the selling off of Americans. Public lands is wildly unpopular.\n\nThat plan to sell federal lands did indeed get killed off last week during the reconciliation process. And there were many other changes. But as of this recording, Trump's mega bill is set to become law with zero Democratic votes in either the House or the Senate before the final house vote. Democratic leader Hakeem Jeffries, spoke in protest for nearly nine hours. He called the bill unconscionable, unacceptable and un-American coming up after the break.

It was a filibuster against the Civil Rights Act. Corey Booker, by the way, is black. Here is a portion of his speech from near the end.\n\nThere's a room here in the Senate named after Strom Thurmond. To hate him is wrong. And maybe my ego got too caught up that if I stood here maybe, maybe just, maybe I could break this record. The man who tried to stop the rights upon which I stand.

He read some correspondence he'd received from his constituents in New Jersey.\n\nThis is a small postcard handwritten from somebody from Hamilton Square, New Jersey. Dear Senator Booker, I'm writing to ask you if my social security is now in danger, please let\n\nMe know. He cited reports from government agencies and from think tanks including conservative think tanks.\n\nMichael Strain, an economist at the Conservative American Enterprise Institute. I know a EI. Well said. Trump's policies on trade and immigration and his slash and burn approach to federal job cuts would have a damaging effect. This is a conservative think tank. What President Trump has proposed will not cause a recession. He continued, but it will slow economic growth. It will take money out of people's pockets. It will increase the unemployment rate. It will cost people jobs. It will make American businesses less competitive. That's a EI folks.\n\nBooker gave the speech as a sort of tribute to his late friend and mentor, John Lewis, a civil rights activist and congressman who liked to talk about the need to make good trouble.\n\nThis is a moral moment. It's not left or right, it's right or wrong. Let's get in good trouble my friend. Madam President, I yield the floor\n\nSo I want to come clean. I did not watch all 25 hours of your speech on the Senate floor. I watched a lot. It was a moment that kind of stopped the country at least for a lot of people. Can you just gimme a little bit behind the scenes? I'm really curious to know how much planning and preparation went into it.\n\nEverywhere I was going, people were saying to me, you're not doing enough. I remember being in the supermarket in Newark and these are folks that have known me since the nineties and these are people who still roll up to me in their car when I'm jogging and say things like, you're gaining weight mayor. And I'm like, I am not your mayor. I am your senator,\n\nBut are you gaining weight?\n\nYes I am. But Jerry of my best friends, I was in the supermarket and somebody was saying to me, why don't you Democrats do this? And I was like, we only have 47 votes. Well why don't you do this? I said, you need the majority. And they're like, Corey, we voted for you because you were that guy that did a hunger strike in the project for 10 days. Why are you telling us what you can't do when you used to find a way outta No way. And it was like the straw that broke the back for me because I was like, I have no response other than you're right. I began pulling my team together to throw around ideas about how we could cause good trouble. And this was one of the ideas we came up with. We've got more in our pocket to try to do what we wanted to do. The goals were really to draw attention to the people who were going to be suffering because of what Donald Trump was doing.\n\nAnd the prep was a lot. I mean over a thousand pages. We didn't wanna read Green eggs and ham. I challenged my team, get me conservative think tanks. We quoted the Cato Institute in a EI get me Republicans voices from business leaders to political leaders. Let's just do this in a way that if you were a moderate in America, this would be compelling to you. And then I had to physically prepare to be honest with you, like I was terrified about how would I get through all these hours without having to go to the bathroom. So I I just figured out how to hack that.\n\nYou went astronaut diaper?\n\nNo, I decided to do what my emergency room doctor cousin thought was really reckless as a middle aged African American man. I thoroughly dehydrated myself and didn't drink liquid for a long time and didn't eat for a few days and that's why she parked herself in the gallery for the entire 25 hours. 'cause she thought I was a stroke\n\nRisk. You probably lost a few pounds though. I\n\nLost a lot of weight and tore up the carpet beneath me because my feet started getting numb in the third hour. 'cause your blood doesn't circulate that well.\n\nI'd like to know what you heard, especially from Republican colleagues afterwards. You've spoken about the quote, appalling silence and inaction of the good people on that side of the aisle and elsewhere. So do you think your performance move the needle in any significant way?\n\nWe did in the sense that the stories we centered elevated the voices of Americans and broke through in a way that we never imagined. Just on TikTok alone, 340 million likes. It ignited a lot of people to fight harder. We were all part of something. What you do, no matter how small you think it is, when you stand up for what's righteous, you send out ripples.\n\nSo you and I have spoken a few times before, I believe the first was in 2016, several months before Trump was elected, the first time you'd been in the Senate a few years, you were still relatively junior. I went back and I listened to that interview and it's a bit of a time capsule. It's just remarkable how the tone of politics has changed. You talked about how much bipartisanship there was. You talked about the quote, incredible allies across the aisle that you're working closely with the Koch brothers team with Newt Gingrich, even Grover Norquist. Considering where partisanship is now, considering what's coming up the next couple months and years of this Trump two administration, which is probably just gonna produce more partisanship.\n\nCan you talk about anything actionable to roll that back to some degree?\n\nLook, I think Donald Trump is a colossal threat. His leadership is a colossal threat. And I'm not saying that myself. I could quote Republican leader after Republican leader, Republican senators who have even said that publicly and still say that to me privately. This is a corrupt president with corruption like we've never seen before. He is a president of sheer chaos and unfortunately he's a president of real cruelty.\n\nLet me just take that statement, which is powerful and respond to it by saying even so, you know, half the country voted for him and if he were to run again in a few years, which would not be allowed, but he might. It's not hard to imagine half the people in vote for him again. How can you explain that level of corruption, chaos and cruelties you just said, how can you explain that despite all that he gets the votes and he has an iron grip on the party?\n\nWell, I'm gonna say two things. One is I fundamentally disagree that he's got the ability to be reelected again.

      "transcript_chunk": "ator, but a 2018 research paper that looked at the 2008 global financial crisis found that fertility actually started dropping in the months before the crisis hit. This suggests if nothing else, that fertility decisions may be more of a leading indicator than was previously thought. So economic uncertainty is something to think about and when it comes to making predictions in a realm as complicated as fertility with so many variables and so many incentives, there is another area of uncertainty that might surprise you.\n\nConsidering how long we humans have been making babies,\n\nIt feels unjust that we know so little about how our reproductive system works and it's such an important part of human existence.\n\nThat is Diana Laird.\n\nI'm a professor at University of California San Francisco in the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology and in the stem cell program.\n\nUmbc SF has been for the past decade the top funded public academic institution by the NIH, the National Institutes of Health.\n\nMy lab is really interested in where our eggs come from, developmentally speaking, how that process plays out, how it affects aging, and the 39 years in humans that we have for our ovaries to actually work and make babies. Those\n\n39 years refer to the average woman's fertility window between puberty and menopause.\n\nWhat we don't know outweighs what we do know. It's first of all really difficult to capture those early stages. We understand very little about how the embryo knows where to go and why in many patients there's repeated failure of implantation of the embryo. Work with human embryos is not fundable by NIH dollars and actually with fertilized embryos is illegal in many states, so that makes it very difficult to ask those fundamental scientific questions.\n\nIf you are, let's say a government hoping to slow down the fertility decline or even reverse it, you'd think it would be useful to answer those fundamental scientific questions. One question has to do with a woman's lifetime supply of eggs. Cells develop in the female while she's still a fetus, it's believed that she starts with around 7 million eggs. By the time she's born, she'll have one to 2 million eggs From there, her supply continues to diminish. And why is that?\n\nWe don't really know how these events in the early development of the embryo connect to the number of eggs that we have. Eventually,\n\nLaird likes to use an economic analogy here.\n\nIf I told you that you're gonna have an inheritance of $7 million, you would probably be really happy. And if I said, well, due to market conditions and volatility, by the time you're born it's gonna be more like 1 million. You'd still probably be like, well, a million dollars is pretty good. But then if I told you that, well, by the time you actually need this inheritance, it's gonna be closer to maybe three or 400,000, you would think I was a really bad investor because you know the eggs are our inheritance. I guess I could make it worse and I could tell you that by the time you use them, a lot of those dollars are not gonna be accepted because they won't work\n\nAnd there's even more uncertainty. Physicians and researchers can't accurately measure the number of eggs in a given woman's ovarian reserves, nor do current tests reveal anything about the quality of an egg while it's in a woman's body.\n\nHow is it that a doctor can't actually tell you how many eggs you have if you're 20? How can you start to make plans about how you're gonna live your life, how you're gonna have a career, whether or not you're going to have children, and when that might happen? How can you make all those decisions if you don't even know how long you have to reproduce and if you'll be able to, I'm not saying that everyone needs to reproduce, but I think it should be a choice. It's a very human experience and it's how we continue our species. Unfortunately, the research funds for understanding the basics of reproduction and fertility have been pretty meager.\n\nIndeed. Researchers have found that NIH applications with the words fertility, ovary, and reproductive have the lowest rates of funding acceptance much lower than keywords like protein or glaucoma or mRNA.\n\nIt makes it a little bit less painful when I get grants rejected. It's not just me.\n\nIn February, president Trump signed an executive order called expanding access to in vitro fertilization as part of his administration's push to boost fertility rates. But soon after his administration eliminated the six person team within the Department of Health and Human Services that tracks IVF. So if scientific research isn't the way forward for a government that wants more babies, how about financial incentives coming up after the break?\n\nIt was a decade long experiment that really was considered unsuccessful.\n\nI'm Steven Dubner.

There are so many ways to save on summer grilling favorites at Whole Foods Market.\n\nIt might be tempting to think that fertility rates have only begun falling recently.\n\nOne of the things that my work shows is that fertility rates have declined in other time periods and in other places.\n\nThat's Amy Freud.\n\nI'm a professor of history at the University of Maryland, Baltimore County.\n\nFreud specializes in early modern Britain women's economic history. In particular\n\nIn the 1690s, England was in the midst of really the beginning of over a hundred years of wars against their enemies, the French, and there was a concern about being a strong and prosperous nation that could compete militarily and politically,\n\nAnd that meant growing their populations. Back then, fertility rates were very closely tied to marriage rates. In many places today that connection is much looser, but King William II of England reckoned that boosting marriage would boost fertility, enter the marriage duty act of 1695.\n\nThey began to tax bachelors over the age of 25 and widowers who were childless. Sometimes elite single women were taxed as well.\n\nFreud says this new tax was likely unpopular as Texas tend to be, but did it work?\n\nWe're not sure that we can prove that it raised marriage rates and it also didn't raise enough money for the king and his wars, so it was abandoned in the early 17 hundreds.\n\nFrance meanwhile was also concerned about their fertility rates, but rather than offer a stick in the form of tax, they offered a carrot.\n\nLouis the XIV passes an edict in promotion of marriage in the 1660s, which is even a little earlier than the concern about marriage in England. In this edict, he was willing to offer financial incentives to men who would marry by the age of 21, which was very young. Also, financial incentives to men who fathered large families.\n\nAs with the marriage tax in England, it's hard for historians like Freud to prove whether these incentives boosted fertility. What's interesting is that just a few decades later, both France and England started to study fertility itself.\n\nBoth countries become much more concerned about what we today would call reproduction. In fact, that's a 18th century term. Before that time generation was usually the term, but there's a more scientific conceptualization of producing children that takes hold along with it is an encouragement of new technologies and new people that might be able to ensure that childbirth is more safe and more successful.\n\nIn England at the time, as many as one in three babies were dying in childbirth or soon after\n\nA 33% infant mortality rate is horrific, right? There was a feeling that perhaps female midwives were not doing an adequate job, and over the 18th century we see the introduction of the man midwife. The man midwife was a male who had been educated at a college or university and who was going to bring a more scientific approach to childbirth, and so men begin to push female midwives out of the business of childbirth. That starts at the apex of society. Women of the nobility and royal women begin to use male midwives at the same time, they also embrace new technologies like the forceps, which are developed by the man midwife family.\n\nThe Chamberlains\n\nSide note here, the Chamberlains family hoarded their invention for more than a century, not sharing it outside their well-bred circle. This withholding of the forceps is thought to have cost millions of lives in France. Meanwhile, the midwife industry went in a different direction.\n\nLouis the 15th decides that he needs to train midwives better and the person he chooses to do that is a woman. Her name was Madam Dre Re was a Parisian midwife who received training and then was part of a regulated body of midwives. She had some of the highest earning power amongst Parisian midwives, and so the king sent her around the country to different cities and towns where she trained local female midwives in some of the up-to-date ways of delivering children that she had been taught in Paris.\n\nMadam Dere promoted a different style of midwifery than the male midwives.\n\nFemale midwives would argue they didn't need forceps because they could handle complicated births with their own hands. Coudray also felt that technology instead of being used in the birthing process, should be used in the teaching process. She developed what she called her machine or her mannequin, which was a simulated pelvis of a woman with accoutrements, like a fetus and a placenta. She used different types of textiles and materials to try to simulate reality. She would have both hard and soft materials, perhaps leather, perhaps linen, different colored materials to indicate different parts of the anatomy.\n\nIt shows her understanding of anatomy, her practical nature, her inventiveness.\n\nCoudray also published a midwife handbook with colored anatomical plates.\n\nIt's hard to prove causality, but we do see in some areas that live births and successful live births were going up. There's a wonderful book by Nina Gelbart called The King's Midwife, where she argues that you could extrapolate the number of successful births based on re's training and then the midwives who followed her training. That kind of thing can be hard to trace though for the 18th century, and one of the sad things is so many records were destroyed in the French revolutionary period.\n\nIf you go back to 18th century England. Meanwhile, it does seem like there was a fertility rebound as evidenced by new concerns about overpopulation,\n\nPeople began to discuss the idea of limiting population as a way to improve one's economy. England is often taken as the example of a country that did that early that is associated with industrialization and the idea that perhaps not as many people are needed to work in the economy. And so it's interesting to me as a historian to see us returning to concerns about having enough workers.\n\nThis is really an eternal question. How many people should be allowed or encouraged to exist in a given space and place? This question can quickly migrate into the political sphere, and from there it's a short step to government policy. Our era is not immune. This recent concern about too few babies, it can feel like whiplash after all those decades of concern about overpopulation and of course before that were more under population worries and so on and so on and so forth. I wasn't kidding when I called it an eternal question, and it swings both ways.\n\nAt the moment. Governments in many countries are trying to boost their babyhood through tax benefits, better parental leave, cash bonuses, state sponsored matchmaking apps, and much more will they work. Here again is the economist, Mattia Stka.\n\nThese are the biggest decisions we take in our lives and you see in the data that people don't respond very strongly to short run changes in policy. Financial incentives. If you just give a bonus for having more children, you know people do respond. They don't respond very much. They are in many ways set in their ways and you make a plan and you will not change it like government by government.\n\nIf you were Secretary of Higher Fertility in Washington in a future time, what would be your best ideas society-wide, and not just perhaps around the time of birth, but what would be your biggest society economy-wide ideas for providing the best situation to boost fertility?\n\nI think we want to imagine what kind of society will want people to have larger families and what are the things holding them back. Right now, we have mentioned many of them. One is this issue of compatibility of careers and having children. That has to do with making it easier for women to rejoin the labor force after they have children, more childcare provision. Another part that's also coming to focus with the epidemic is this issue of flexibility of jobs. If you have a job but it's completely inflexible, meaning you have to be there 10 hours every day, you can never leave. If, for example, a child has a fever or has a theater performance, that will also make it more difficult. So creating workplaces that are a bit more flexible for everybody will also make it easier for families to decide to have that additional child.\n\nI went back to Catherine Alek, the economist mother of 14, an author of Hannah's children.\n\nI don't believe that policymakers ought to aim to influence household decision making as regards children. The reason I say that is because those costs and benefits, the big ones, the ones that are really affecting our current situation, those are subjective and personal policy can't hit those things.\n\nDo you feel that that position aligns you with a particular political movement or even a name?\n\nI sometimes use the language of a pragmatic libertarian, pragmatic in the sense that I'm not committed to the philosophical foundations of libertarianism.\n\nYou write, the flourishing of traditional religious institutions breaks the low marriage, low fertility cycle. People will lay down their comfort dreams and selves for God, not for subsidies. Can you say a little bit more about that? Because as the global fertility rate falls, we're seeing more and more governments take all kinds of measures to try to boost births. As far as I can tell, most of these fail or they might produce a short term birth boom, but that seems to be just a timing thing, that it's not actually encouraging people to have more children. Just the timing. Can you talk about the ways in which as you write it, government subsidies are weaker than internal or religious guidance?",

      "transcript_chunk": "Chinese people of the West? Is there a similar level of misunderstanding the other direction as well?\n\nI don't think to the same extent because there's Hollywood, you can see daily American life, although it might not be totally realistic. There was a huge amount of admiration of US technology innovation, but also the American dream. I think our newspapers, even though there's bias everywhere, is not focused only on reporting the really bad stuff and portraying a negative side. I, I think these few years have been a little bit different. But so many students went to the us, right? So many people travel to the US and this is an interesting thing.\n\nI've rarely met an American who has been to China and who still goes on about how bad China is. I think that going to China makes all the difference.\n\nI feel that's like one of the big gaps of my life that I need to alleviate is to travel in a real way for a long time to really experience the people and the cultures. And China's a big place.\n\nGo, go dig deep and don't just Go to Beijing and Shanghai.\n\nLet's go back to the economics. So can you just dig a little deeper on the relationship in China between the government and the companies in the private sector? So how much freedom do companies have?\n\nAnother big misunderstanding and a fundamental one is that people somehow think that the state suppresses the private sector. It's not at all as simple as that. For the most part, if we look at the local government's incentive system, they wanna help the best private companies, which are the most promising because it makes them look good. It adds to their GDP, it adds to the jobs investment. They are so helpful to these private companies. Actually, I I, I know many of these local government officials working tirelessly day and night, especially in bad times to coordinate between debtors and creditors and to kind of smooth out and define relationships with banks.\n\nThey wanna help these private companies because again, their incentives are aligned. Deep seek is private company by the way. So it has done the country proud. And why would the state wanna go and suppress these private companies? Which ultimately is kind of a beacon, represents a beacon success for China now on how much freedom they have. It's really ranged from too much freedom. That's part of the problem where you have defense companies buying art auction houses, real estate companies like ever grande, buying soccer clubs, doing EVs companies, investing in real estate that has nothing to do with their core business.\n\nThat's how much latitude were given to private companies and there were consequences they were not reigned in. And then you Go to the other extremes where they're scolded, they're reprimanded, they're reigned in and they're kind of folded into submission. So that, that is the whole spectrum. You have the whole range. But I guess what we're really getting at is it is a country that is moving from a no rule of law or very little rule of law, very immature markets to something that is being gradually established. Bankruptcy laws, you know, corruption laws, rules and regulations on what's possible.\n\nOne interesting point is that in China, you, you ask the companies to innovate first and then you re regulate after, right? So that has led to things like P two P platforms, the, you know, it's led to lots of kind of financial innovations, some of which has actually been very helpful and good, some of which had been disastrous. But the intention to regulate after the fact is to really not slow down or hinder the innovation. This is a very different approach from Europe. You regulate first and then you know, con companies have to work around that. So the, this is why Chinese economy is so complex.\n\nYou cannot reduce it to simply a statement saying the state is unhelpful for the private or, or, or something like that. There are certain sectors where these SOEs dominate, right? When it comes to national security in terms of energy. But let's not focus on these few sectors. By and large, most of the economy, if you actually admit to the fact that China's highly innovative and highly entrepreneurial means that it must be the private sector that is driving the show.\n\nInnovate first, regulate after really interesting. I also in my mind am contrasting it with the way the Soviet Union and Russia since operated. That doesn't sound at all like this model. And it's interesting that countries that at least on the surface had a similar cultural communist problems. You know, the bureaucracies that form inside the communist state. It just seems that China broke away from that somehow. Yeah. That don't understand exactly what happened\n\nIn the west. They grouped these economies together as if they're the same thing. No, it's not the same at all. There's so many differences, so much more flexibility. You can have dynamic entrepreneurialism at the same time have socialist characteristics. And I think this is what China has been able to shape and mold a unique model that balances between government industry, between state coordination and market mechanisms and between individualism and communalism. It's not necessarily black and white. You can't have all these things at the same time.\n\nSo what are the pros and cons of being an entrepreneur in China versus the west? Like if you get a choice, you have a dream, you wanna build epic things, what? And you get to choose where to start that business. What are the pros and cons of each path\n\nIn China? The speed is just all inspiring. You have a good idea, you implement it, you realize you're dreaming very fast because there's also the support system, right? The infrastructure there, the digital infrastructure there, the engineers are there, the talent is there and they're cheap. And the market competition is there, is to keep, to keep you going. The consumers give you a very, very fast feedback. You know, well OMI was making phones and now it makes one of the world's best EVs 270,000 cars sold in one day a few days ago with a new model. They were phone makers. So there's an advantage to that. Okay? But I would not feel safe.\n\nNot because of danger of exploitation or nothing like that, but the BA bankruptcy laws are not there, right? It's not necessarily always fair competition. Things don't happen necessarily in orderly manner. If you have a competitor, you can have a very evil competitor and evil competitors are there everywhere in China. They would, you know, call the police on you, put you in jail, spread false rumors about you. Maybe that happens also in the US but there's a different, it's a different level in China. And also the mold that you can have to protect yourself. The IP protection, right? That's much weaker in China because the legal system is not very effective.\n\nYou have a good idea, you'll be copied and there's a lot of work. You have to, you have to dine in wine with the local governments. I mean that's not allowed anymore by the way. But you dine in wine, you know, figuratively speaking, you have to have a very good relationship with 'em. That's a different kind of work.\n\nThe wine and dine and the evil competitors is an interesting challenge that in some maybe distant ways akin to the problems of the Soviet Union. I think, I guess in the United States there's less of that. And I don't even know if that's based on laws. 'cause there's a lot of lawyers in the US that could do the same kind of evil competitor stuff. Technically\n\nThat's true. The potential negative ramifications are there, but I I, I think personal protection is a big difference. Few, you make a mistake if you, your company's not run well, you know, you Go to jail. I think that the US is much, much more tolerant on entrepreneurship, entrepreneurs on failure,\n\nSince we're talking about it. There was a, a lot of controversy around Jack Ma disappearing, quote unquote, and reappearing a bit later. And there's been sort of rumors of some tense relationships that he has with the Chinese government. What is important to understand about the health situation? Like to what degree is it reflective of the issues entrepreneurs face in China,\n\nIn the US capital controls politics? One could argue in China, it has to be the other way around. Capital must be reigned in by politics as part of the capitalist class. Do not have them ambition to exceed the powers of a political class is really at the core of it, I'd say. And the biggest difference between us and China, there are important details that I think think the West has not fully provided to the public, for instance, and financial, as innovative as it was, was doing banking jobs without being regulated like a bank, right?\n\nSo that obviously poses a host of financial stability questions and, and rules and regulations and so forth. So the fact that IPO was halted, you could say that there were strong economic regulatory grounds for that. But I think more broadly speaking, if you're an entrepreneur, part of the capitalist class, keep your head down, make money, and that's fine, right? Do some philanthropy. There are also many, many other billionaires that are just fine, that are actually very much in favor of the political leadership and they do their thing.\n\nNow, I'm not saying what's right, what's wrong. It's just a very, very different culture and different country in the us It's great to be colorful. I mean, you have a very, very colorful president. He would never have been able to make it in China. You have the likes of Elon Musk. It's great to be different, it's great to stand out. You do not wanna stand out in China. So the moral of the story is that the top leadership understands that it needs these top entrepreneurs, the likes of Jack Ma. And they have done so many great things for the country, even for the world. But in China, garnering too much influence and power, even through social media, doesn't make you look that great.\n\nIt's not a good thing for you personally. And, and there's a saying in China that you just don't wanna be the tallest tree, right? The tallest tree gets the most wind. So I don't agree at all with the western conclusion that this anecdote, this story has meant that entrepreneurs don't wanna be entrepreneurs anymore. The young kids don't aspire to be people like Jack Ma. That's not true at all. The, the incentives are still there. It's a different kind of rich elite class in China.\n\nSo, on, on what dimensions do you think that the height of the tree is measured? Is it, is it more about just mouthing off in public? So can you still be the richest person in China and actually not clash with the state?\n\nAbsolutely. Don't be too outspoken. Don't try to get too much attention and too much influence and just, you know, again, it's a cultural thing. But just keep your head down, be humble, you know, contribute to society, do philanthropy, work, collaborate with the government and you're kind of, okay.\n\nSo the signal the Jack Ma situation sends to the entrepreneurs in China is, is, is not, don't be an entrepreneur, is more like, don't be too colorful. Don't be too colorful. And colorful means you can be colorful about the technical details of, of your technology. But don't be colorful about Xi Jinping and, and, and politics and just stay out.\n\nYeah, stay out of politics. But I just wanna say that said, Jack Ma was really an emblem of extreme success, right? For China and the Chinese entrepreneurs look up to him. That's really important. It was a signal that unfortunately was misconstrued by the deciding and by also outside world. But it's laid a different path for what these entrepreneurs should be doing.\n\nWhat do you think happened to him? So he's now, I think living in Japan that's by\n\nChoice.\n\nBy choice.\n\nNo, he's, he, look, he's an extremely fascinating character, which, you know, and if he were in the US he'd thrive. Funny, witty, smart, wise, creative, loves a good life. And I think it's by choice that he's roaming around the world, given that he has more free time.\n\nYou think he loves China?\n\nAll of them do. All of them do. Because their lives, their, their destinies were totally changed because of China, because of the government, because of Deng Xing, because of everything.\n\nSo, you know, I know a lot of people from the, the former Soviet a union, and there's a deep resentment of broken promises, broken dreams. So that is not something you see,\n\nThat's not how I would describe that generation and their feelings towards China. Of course, you always get exceptions, right? The ones who have moved to the US and who, who, who wants a democracy. But by and large people are deeply grateful to China, the Chinese government, the Communist party, if you wanna label it as that, because they've seen their lives be totally transformed. I mean, Jack Ma went from being a school teacher to becoming one of the most powerful people in the world. I mean, if you didn't have China, what, what, how could that have happened? Right.\n\nCan you speak to the thing you mentioned a few times, which is the difference in American versus Chinese, or maybe Western versus Chinese approach to entrepreneurship, zero to one versus one to end. Maybe can you explain that? And what will it take for China to become a consistent zero to one innovator for the individual entrepreneurs to create totally new things versus doing the things you mentioned about speed and scale.\n\nThe US will lead for some time on breakthroughs on disruptive technologies, the zero to one technologies that ultimately changed the world. But innovation is a process. It goes from invention to production and commercialization and diffusion, diffusing technology throughout all parts of the economy. And on those two stages, I think that China has a unique advantage, even if it still can't do the zero to one breakthroughs, because in the end, how much this technology is adopted by the countries and by the various parts of the economy is fundamentally crucial to how much productivity will be unleashed.\n\nAnd China's innovation currently, the deep seeker is really one example. And I think it's really the beginning of the scale based, leading edge technology, cost, cutting driven kind of innovation model could be just as powerful, maybe even more effective and powerful than the breakthroughs. And as a very different approach to innovation, the Chinese companies focus on solutions, problem solving. Again, that comes back to the education system, right? You're giving a problem, I'm gonna find the answer. The Chinese students can do it. You want them to write their own question, they can't do it, right?\n\nI'm exaggerating a little bit, but it's a little like that, right? They see a problem they're gonna go after and they're gonna find the best solution. And that's really, really useful, right? Because we don't need, or developing countries especially, don't need these frontier technologies that they can't use. And China currently has this AI plus program, which is about pushing AI into every single plausible sector with the help of the state. So adoption diffusion is very important. Why China can't do breakthroughs or can't do zero to one technologies, I think at the root of it, and there are some deeper, we talked about the, the, the proximate reasons, the short, flat, fast, for instance, right?\n\nYou don't wanna spend too much time on investigating something that you don't even know if it's commercially viable. So basic research is still weaker than in the US universities, but also this kind of intrinsic motivation. It's very different, right? In China, it's driven by extrinsic motivation. You are rewarded by, you know, compensation, financial compensation, all these kind of extrinsic motivation is what drives you. But intrinsic motivation, pursuit of knowledge for knowledge sake, right? That was deep in the Confucius philosophies. But of course, you know, poverty has changed all that.",

      "transcript_chunk": "st years. Just insane. Right?\n\nIt's, yeah, exactly. That's, that's what relentlessness looks like. I think it's, it's a question of like any big company, you know, ends up having a, a lot of layers of management and things like that is sort of the nature of how it works. But I still operate and I was always operating with Old Deep Mind as a, as a startup. Still large one, but still as a startup. And that's what we still act like today as with Google Deep Mind and acting with decisiveness and the energy that you get from the best smaller organizations. And we try to get the best of both worlds where we have this incredible billions of users surfaces incredible products that we can power up with our AI and our, and our research.\n\nAnd that's amazing. And you can, you know, that's very few places in the world you can get that, do incredible world class research on the one hand and then plug it in and and improve billions of people's lives the next day. That's a pretty amazing combination. And we're continually fighting and cutting away bureaucracy to allow the research culture and the relentless shipping culture to flourish. And I think we've got a pretty good balance whilst being responsible with it, you know, as you have to be as a large company and also with a number of, you know, huge products surfaces that we have.\n\nSo, a funny thing you mentioned about like the, the surface of the billion, I, I had a conversation with a guy named brilliant guy here at the British Museum called Irvin Finkel. He's a world expert at K Forms, which is a ancient writing on tablets. Yeah. And he doesn't know about Chad GBT or Gemini. He doesn't even know anything about ai. But his first encounter with this AI is AI mode on Yes. Google. Yes. He's like, is that what you're talking about? Yes. This AI mode. And then, you know, it's just, it's just a reminder that there's a large part of the world that doesn't know about this AI thing. Yeah,\n\nI know. It's funny 'cause if you live on X and Twitter, and I mean, it's sort of at least my feed, it's all AI and, and there's certain places where, you know, in the valley and certain pockets where everyone's just, all they're thinking about is ai. But a lot of the normal world hasn't, hasn't come across it yet. But,\n\nAnd that's a great responsibility to the their first interaction. Yep. The, the, the grand scale of the rural India or anywhere across the world like you\n\nGet to, right. And we want it to be as good as possible. And in a lot of cases it's just under the hood powering, making something like maps or search work better. And, and it's ideally for a lot of those people should just be seamless. It's just new technology that makes their lives more, you know, productive and, and, and helps them.\n\nA bunch of folks on the Gemini product and engineering teams spoken extremely highly of you on another dimension that I almost didn't even expect. 'cause I kind of think of you as the like deep scientists and caring about these big research scientific questions, but they also said you're a great product guy. Like how to create a thing that a lot of people would use and enjoy using. So can you maybe speak to what it takes to create a, a AI based product that a lot of people don't enjoy using? Yeah.\n\nWell I mean that, again, that comes back from my game design days where I used to design games for millions of gamers. People would forget about that. I've, I've had experience with cutting edge technology in product that, that, that, that is how games was in the nineties. And so I love actually the combination of cutting edge research and then being applied in a product and to power a new experience. And so I think it's the same skill really of, of, you know, imagining what it would be like to use it viscerally and having good taste coming back to earlier. The same thing that's useful in science, I think is, is can also be useful in, in product design. And I, I've just had a very, you know, always been a sort of multidisciplinary person.\n\nSo I don't see the boundaries really between, you know, arts and sciences or product and research. It's, it's a continuum for me. I mean, I only work on, I like working on products that are cutting edge. I wouldn't be able to, you know, have cutting edge technology under the hood. I wouldn't be excited about them if they were just run of the mill products. So it requires this invention, creativity, cap capability.\n\nWhat are some specific things you kind of learned about when you, even on the LLM side, you're interacting with Gemini, you like, this doesn't feel like the layout, the, the interface, maybe the trade opport between the latency, like how, how to present to the user, how long to wait and how that weighting is shown or the reasoning capabilities. Is there some interesting things? 'cause like you said, it's the very cutting edge. We don't know Yeah. How to present it, how to present it correctly. So is there some specific things you've, you've learned?\n\nI mean it's such a false evolving space. We're evaluating this all the time, but where we are today is that you want to continually simplify things. The in whether that's the interface I simplify. Yeah. Or, or the inter the what you build on top of the model. You kind of wanna get out of the way of the model. The model train is coming down the track and it's improving unbelievably fast. This relentless progress we talked about earlier. You know, you look at 2.5 versus 1.5 and it's just a gigantic improvement. And we expect that again for the future versions. And so the models are becoming more capable. So you've got, the interesting thing about the design space in, in, in today's world, these AI first products is you've gotta design not for what the thing can do today. The technology can do today, but in a year's time.\n\nSo you actually have to be a very technical product person because you've gotta kind of have a good intuition for and feel for, okay, that thing that I'm dreaming about now can't be done today, but is the research track on schedule to basically intercept that in six months or a year's time. So you kind of gotta intercept where this highly changing technology's going as well as the new capabilities are coming online all the time that you didn't realize before that can allow like d research to work or now we've got video generation, what do we do with that? This multimodal stuff, you know, is it, one question I have is, is it really going to be the current UI that we have today, these text box chats seems very unlikely give once you think about these super multimodal systems.\n\nShouldn't it be something more like minority report where you are, you are sort of vibing with it in a, in a co in a kind of collaborative way, right? It seems very restricted today. I think we'll look back on today's interfaces and products and systems as quite archaic in maybe in just a couple of years. So I think there's a lot of sp space actually for innovation to happen on the product side as well as the, the research side. And\n\nThen we are offline talking about the keyboard is the, the open question is how, when and how much will we move to audio as the primary way of interacting with the machines around us versus typing stuff.\n\nYeah, I mean typing is a very low bandwidth way of doing it. Even if you're a very fast, you know, typer. And I think we are gonna have to start utilizing other devices, whether that's smart glasses, you know, audio earbuds and eventually maybe some sorts of neural devices where we can increase the, the input and the output bandwidth to something, you know, maybe a hundred x of what is today.\n\nI think that, you know, underappreciated art form is the interface design because I think you can not unlock the power of the intelligence of a system if you don't have the right interface. The interface is really the way you unlock it's power. Yeah. It's such an interesting question of how to do that. Yeah. So how, how you would think like getting outta the way isn't real art form.\n\nYes. You know, it's the sort of thing that I guess Steve Jobs always talked about, right? It's simplicity, beauty and elegance that we want. Right. And we're not there. Nobody's there yet in my opinion. And that's what I would like us to get to. Again, it sort of speaks to like, go again, right? As a game, the most elegant, beautiful game. Can you, you know, that can you make an interface as beautiful as that? And actually I think we're gonna enter an era of AI generated interfaces that are probably personalized to you. So it fits the way that you, your aesthetic, your feel, the way that your brain works and, and, and, and the AI kind of generates that depending on the task, you know, that feels like that's probably the direction we'll end up in.\n\nYeah. 'cause some people are power users and they want every single parameter on the screen. Everything and everything based like perhaps me with a keyboard. Yeah. Keyboard based navigation. I'd like to have shortcuts for everything. And some people like the minimalism just\n\nHide all of that complexity. Yeah, completely. Exactly.\n\nYeah. Well I'm glad you have a Steve Jobs mode in you as well. This is great. Einstein mode, Steve Jobs mode. All right. Let me try to trick you into answering a question. When, when will Gemini three come out? This is before or after DTA six. The world waits for both. And what does it take to go from two five to three? Oh because it seems like there's been a lot of releases of two five, which are already leaps in performance. Hmm. So what, what does it even mean to Go to a new version? Is it about performance? This is about a complete different flavor of an experience? Yeah,\n\nWell so the way it works with our different version numbers is we, you know, we try to collect, so maybe it takes, you know, roughly six months or something to, to do a new kind of full run and the full productization of a new version. And during that time, lots of new interesting research iterations and ideas come up and we sort of collect them all together that, you know, you could imagine the last six months worth of interesting ideas on the architecture front. Maybe it's on the data front. It's like many different possible things. And we collect package that all up test which ones are likely to be useful for the next iteration and then bundle that all together.\n\nAnd then we start the new, you know, giant hero training run. Right? And, and then, and then of course that gets monitored and then at the end then there's the, of the pre-training, then there's all the post-training, there's many different ways of doing that. Different ways of patching it. So there's a whole experimenting phase there, which you can also get a lot of gains out. And that's where you see the version numbers usually are referring to the base model, the pre-train model, and then the interim versions of 2.5, you know, and the different sizes and the different little additions. They're often patches or post-training ideas that can be done afterwards off the same basic architecture. And then of course on top of that we also have different sizes, pro and flash and flashlight that are often distilled from the biggest ones.\n\nYou know, the flash model from the pro model. And that means we have a range of different choices if you are the developer of do you wanna pro prioritize performance or speed, right? And cost. And we like to think of this Pareto frontier of, of, you know, on the one hand the y axis is, you know, like performance and then the, the, the X axis is, you know, cost or latency and and speed basically. And we, we have models that completely define the frontier. So whatever your trade off is that you want as an individual user or as a, as a developer, you should find one of our models satisfies that constraint.\n\nSo behind diversion changes there is a big hero run. Yes. And then there's just an insane complexity of productization. Then there's the distillation of the different sizes along that preto front. And then as with each step you take, you realize there might be a cool product. There's site quests. Yes,\n\nExactly.\n\nBut and then you also don't want to take too many side quests because then you have a million versions Yes. And a million products. Yes,\n\nPrecisely.\n\nIt's very, it's very unclear. Yeah. But you also get super excited 'cause it's super cool. Yeah. Like how does even you look at vo very cool. Yeah. How does it fit into the bigger Yes. Thing Exactly.\n\nYeah. Exactly. And then you're constantly this process of converging upstream, we call it, you know, ideas from the, from the product surfaces or, or or from the post training. And, and even further downstream than that you, you kind of upstream that into the, the core model training for the next run. Right? So then the main model, the main Gemini track becomes more and more general and eventually, you know, a GI\n\nOne hero run at a time.\n\nYes, exactly. A few hero runs later.\n\nYeah. So sometimes when you release these new versions or every version really are, are benchmarks productive or counterproductive for showing the performance of a model\n\nModel. You need them and, and, but it's important that you don't over fit to them. Right? So they shouldn't be the end with a be all and end all. So there's, there's LM Marina or it used to be called Elemis, that's one of them that turned out sort of organically to be one of the, the main ways people like to test these systems. At least the chat bots. Obviously there's loads of academic benchmarks on from, from that test, mathematics and coding ability, general language ability, science ability and so on. And then we have our own internal benchmarks that we care about. It's a kind of multi objective, you know, optimization problem, right? You, you don't want to be good at just one thing. We're trying to build general systems that are good across the board and you try and make no regret improvements.\n\nSo where you improve in like, you know, coding, but it doesn't reduce your performance in other areas. Right? So that's the hard part. 'cause you, you can, of course you could put more coding data in or you could put more, I don't know, gaming data in, but then does it make worse your language system or or in, in your translation systems and other things that you care about. So it's, you've gotta kind of continually monitor this increasingly larger and larger suite of, of benchmarks. And also there's, when you stick them into products, these models, you also care about the direct usage and the direct stats and the signals that you're getting from the end users. Whether they're coders or, or or the average person using, using the chat interfaces.\n\nYeah. Because ultimately you wanna measure the usefulness. It's so hard to convert that into a number. Right. It's, it's really vibe based benchmarks across a large number of users and it's hard to know and I, it would be just terrifying to me to, you know, you have a much smarter model, but it's just something vibe based. It's not, not not quite working. That's such a scary because, and everything you just said, it has to be smart and useful across so many domains. So you, you get super excited 'cause it's all of a sudden solving programming problems it never been able to solve before but now it's crappy poetry or something. Yes. And it's just Right. I don't know. That's a stressful, that's so difficult\n\nTo balance. Yeah.\n\nTo balance. And because you can't really trust the benchmarks, you really have to trust the end users.\n\nYeah. And then other things that are even moister come into play. Like, you know, the style of the persona of the, the the system, you know, how it, you know, is it verbose? Is it succinct? Is it humorous? You know, and they and different people like different things. Yeah. So, you know, it's very interesting. It's almost like cutting edge part of psychology research or person personality research.",

      "transcript_chunk": "o love thy neighbor as thyself and so on. I can imagine people paying lip service to that, but certainly from a lot of contemporary commentary, and I think probably Robert would fall into that. From my reading of him, people struggled to actually follow it through in their daily lives.\n\nWould he have believed in curses and was he perhaps on either the receiving or giving end of a curse? Really\n\nHard to know that from this period because it's not showing up in quite the same way in our records. Certainly people talk nastily about each other.\n\nThe gossip and hearsay was so much bigger source of information in the Middle Ages than it is now. You would rely a lot on what other neighbors tell you\n\nAnd they did it without social media even. Exactly.\n\nThat was the social media basically gossip and hearsay. That was also the basis of the criminal justice system, by the way.\n\nWhat do you mean?\n\nThat's how they found the suspects. They would go around and ask people what gossip they have heard. If a crime has been committed and no one knows who committed it,\n\nBut then at a certain point you tried to gather some actual evidence. Yes,\n\nThat would be really difficult without forensic science. If you think about the way the modern criminal justice system works, if there are no witnesses to a crime, what are your fallbacks fingerprints and DNA analysis. None of that existed.\n\nSo what do you think the false conviction rate was?\n\nIn a place like Rome or Peru, which are neighboring places to Florence, the conviction rate was so low, only 10% of trials resulted in a conviction. 90% would be let go out of the reason that there is not enough evidence to convict them because the judges had it on their conscious. If they wrongfully sent somebody to execution, so they would have to let them go if there is not enough evidence.\n\nWas the legal system informed by religious feeling or religious devotion?\n\nOh yes, absolutely. Judges and the juries would always take an oath that they're going to follow the procedure, they are going to tell the truth somehow. People really have taken that quite seriously, especially the judges. You can see that they are cringing not to give in. They don't wanna execute people. They're very afraid that in the other life God will see them as a murderer if they do that without sufficient evidence.\n\nAnd then did they conversely assume that if someone did commit a crime but there is no evidence and the judge doesn't want to convict, do they assume that that criminal will be punished anyway by God?\n\nIt's not that they think that God will punish them anyway, so let us not punish them. That is not the case because they definitely did understand that if you do not hold people accountable, then crime will increase. You do need to detour people.\n\nHow was that balance struck with such a low conviction rate?\n\nThis low conviction rate belongs to the period where the trial started by an accusation. There are two types of trials. The ones that start basically because I go and say to the judge, my neighbor stole from me, and that would start a trial against my neighbor. I would denounce my neighbor myself, but then I would have to prove the guilt.\n\nI see. And the other way,\n\nAfter 1250s you get a new trial, which is the basis of the modern trial. We have inquisition trials. The state starts the trial. The state makes a case against a person based on the public rumors, based on gossip, and then the conviction rate goes higher. People resented that, especially in England, the start of the Inquisition trial. They said State has no business interfering into people's conflicts.\n\nInteresting.\n\nIt has been seen as an infringement into the rights of the people.\n\nYou mentioned this change came around 1250. There must have been a period where both systems were operating at the same time. Yes,\n\nExactly. Very good. In fact, if you go to the judiciaries, which still hold the ancient Medieval records, there are two books there, the Book of Acquisitions and Book of Inquisitions.\n\nHow long did the accusations last? When did that die out?\n\nWell, that's a very good question and frankly I do not know the answer. But it went on for a very long time. It was considered a right of the people to accuse someone who committed a crime against them.\n\nComing up after the break, let's talk about dying in the Middle Ages. The people we spoke with at the Renaissance Fair in New Jersey had some things to say about that.\n\nI don't think I would've survived a lot. I'm clumsy, weak. I probably would've broke my back pulling a plow or been trampled down by a Viking invader.\n\nI would've not survived\n\nAnything. I would like to think I would've survived the bubonic plague. But when the the hand of the Reaper comes a sweeping across Europe and wipes out a sizable percentage of the population, it doesn't matter what you did.\n\nI'm Steven Dubner.

As we all know, the definitive historical account comes from Monty Python and the Holy Grail\n\nOut. Your dad,\n\nBring out your dads one nine infants. I'm not dead. What? Nothing. Here's your nine infants. I'm not dead. Yeah, he says he's not dead. Yes, he is. I'm not. He isn't. Well, he will be soon. He is very ill. I'm getting better. No, you're not. You'll be stone dead in a moment. Oh, I can't take him like that. He against regulations\n\nAnd here is an actual historian, Philip Schofield,\n\nUndoubtedly death was there. I mean, death is always there.\n\nEven today. Apparently.\n\nYeah, apparently so. I've heard in the second decade of the 14th century, there is a period known as the great famine where maybe 10 to 15% of the population died. We can't really see the total impact of that because the most vulnerable are the least visible. We tend to think of peasant households as being complex and full of generations, but in reality they probably weren't. Mostly because people didn't live long enough really for that to happen. Something we don't know a lot about for this period, but we know about later periods as infant mortality. If you had a number of children and the strong likelihood is you would also have a considerable degree of loss in your life because of that violent death is also reasonably prevalent.\n\nAnd what about medicine in 14th century England? What happens when Robert, the son of Adam or someone in his family is sick,\n\nThey have a monastic community. That's their Lord. So they may seek support from their community. There will be an infirmary there. There are things called hospitals, but they tend to be relatively low scale. Unlike in Tuscany for example, where this period, there are substantial hospitals here. They are intended to house and support a symbolic number of poor, often the equivalent to the number of the apostles, for example. But you would have people that would travel around offering a range of skills, including some limited medical skill. So people who are barber surgeons who might help set an arm or do something like that.\n\nNestle shek you will remember located herself and her family in Florence. This is starting to look like a wise choice.\n\nThere were public hospitals in Florence, so if you are really sick and you need to be taken care of, then you can go there and anybody who volunteers there, they would take care of you for free. Still, the healthcare is obviously, compared to the modern knowledge that we have, is much more limited. They just do not know what are the causes of the many diseases.\n\nAntibiotics will go a long way to treat bubonic plague. But in the Middle Ages, obviously that was not available across Western Europe. Between 1347 and 1350, possibly 45% of the population died. What's remarkable is how society coped with that. I don't know how modern society would cope with 45% mortality, but there is in enormous continuity, there's a lot of contemporary comment and shock and fearfulness, but also the local records I was talking about record for instance, repeatedly X has died, Y has died, Zed has died, and so on. You get that persistence of normality in the face of something that was utterly abnormal.\n\nNestle, how about you living in 13th century Florence with your husband and two sons? How do you think about death?\n\nYes, that's the big question. I would worry about it. What will happen to me when I die and if I'm a divine Christian? Def, definitely I would believe in afterlife, so I would try to prepare myself and not leave it to old age because that's actually what a lot of people have done even in the Middle Ages. They live their youth rather frivolously.\n\nHow old would you expect to live until,\n\nOh, that depends on so many conditions, but I would hope that I can live until maybe 55, 60.\n\nHow old are you now in real life?\n\n52. I didn't\n\nRealize I was speaking with you so close to the end of your life. Well,\n\nYeah,\n\nI'm going to miss you.\n\nWell, there will be somebody else in my place doing the stained glass.\n\nNo, no, no. I don't mean your stained glass. I mean, I've taken a liking to you during this conversation. When you said 52, I imagined you living easily till 70 or 75.\n\nNo, I don't think that very often happened to ordinary medieval citizens.\n\nI asked Philip Schofield if he would've liked to live during the period he studies.\n\nI think for a short period of time, I'd be interested. One of the things that would be shocking would be the level of casual cruelty. These villages where people are living fairly close to a marginal existence can be harsh places. A woman cropped up in litigation that I was looking at recently who had been told to return eight hens that she'd purchased from somebody, and he then said, well, she's defamed me because she did return the eight hens, but she'd stitched their heads together. Ooh. I think that hints at a kind of culture that we might find difficult to immediately just settle into.\n\nIf you did have that opportunity, I mean, we're just talking about time travel here now, which is a constant fascination for so many of us. What are maybe one or two of the most unanswered or perhaps unanswerable questions about that life that you as an economic historian would really love to crack?\n\nWhat I've mentioned earlier would be the proportion of the truly vulnerable. What does that society look like if you walk down a street? Do you see in a village people that are mostly doing fine and supporting each other, or do you see desperation alongside relative prosperity? So it's not a particularly pleasant angle, but I think it's an important one. The degree of social inequality is something that our sources don't really give us full insight into.\n\nAnd would your main motivation for understanding that be gratitude from a modern perspective or simply empirical verification?\n\nIt would mostly be empirical in a sense that I'd really want to know what are the hidden stories in our history that we're not picking up that has its own solitary lessons, of course, for our contemporary society, about how we think of ourselves and what we miss in our society, and how we ignore those that perhaps are not as advantaged as others. You know, what are we missing? There was someone called Thel Rogers writing in the 19th century who said what he wouldn't give for a history of the medieval village when so much of a history is wasted on the froth of kings and queens.\n\nAnd I went back to Nestle Han Shek too. At the beginning of this conversation, you said you think you would prefer to live then as long as you could take your family with you. Now that we've talked about all these different elements, the economics and the legal system and religiosity and food, et cetera, et cetera, I'm curious how you're feeling about your choice. You'd prefer to be there then, even though according to you, you'd only have a few more years of life left. And it sounds like you're going to spend a lot of that life in church repenting and so on. Or would you rather stay with us here? Well,\n\nThat's a difficult question 'cause you know, I have a really nice life here too. But for one thing, I don't see the point of trying to live longer and longer. It's the same thing, just more. It depends on how I live the life that might be naive of me. The stress was much less in the Middle Ages. Now we have to deal with a million things. The technology in so many ways has made our life hell. The social media, the emails that you have to reply, electronic banking and taxes that you have to figure out. Also, the fact that you don't have electricity in many ways, you do get a very good rest. You don't keep working at night.\n\nWill you take me with you\n\nIf you're ready? Yes. Do you think you can do it?\n\nI don't know. At the beginning of this conversation, I never would've thought so. But you're fairly persuasive.\n\nYeah. Well, I have to be. I teach this, you know, I'm always looking for words.\n\nWhen we first had the idea for this episode to explore What It would be like to have been middle Aged in the Middle Ages, I thought it might be a ridiculous pursuit. But now that we've made the episode, I don't think it's ridiculous at all. It's something I love about history and historians. They are so good at bringing you into their world that your mind starts racing with comparisons to your own time. The benefits of the modern world are massive, but as Nestle, she Jacque pointed out, there are also significant costs.\n\nThe more people get into your life, the more difficulty your life becomes. And so I, I'd rather try to have a small life.\n\nHow do you think about our time versus that one?",

      "transcript_chunk": "or example. Yes. So like, you know, flash didn't take over the internet, but Moore's law law worked. So yes, we don't know which one AI is, which\n\nOne it is. And this is what I find so fascinating too. I forget who did this presentation, but someone in the web community, this great presentation on the history of the airplane. So you go from the Wright brothers flying in, what is it, 1903 or something like that, and 40 years later you have a jet flight. Just an unbelievable amount of progress in four decades. Then in 56, I think it was the halt design for the Boeing 7 47 century precursor was designed and basically nothing has happened since. Just minor tweaks and improvements on the flying experience since the fifties.\n\nSomehow, if you were to predict where flying was gonna go, and you were sitting in 42 and you'd seen, you'd remember the Wright brothers flying in oh three and you were seeing that jet engines coming, you're like, we're gonna fly to to the stars in another two decades. We're gonna invent super mega hypersonic flights that's gonna traverse the earth in in two hours. And then that didn't happen. It tapped out. This is what's so hard at predicting about predicting the future. We can be so excited in the moment because we're drawing a line through early dots on a chart, and it looks like those early dots are just going up into the right and sometimes it just flatten out. This is also one of those things where we have so much critical infrastructure, for example, that still runs on Cobolt, that about five humans around the world really understand, truly, deeply that there's a lot, it's possible for society to lose a competence.\n\nIt still needs because it's chasing the future. COBOL is still with us. This is one of the things I think about with with programming Ruby on Rails is at such a level now that in 50 years from now, it's exceedingly likely that there's still a ton of ruby and rail systems running around and very hard to predict what that exact world is gonna be like. But yesterday's weather tells us that if there's still cobalt code from the seventies operating social security today, and we haven't figured out a clean way to convert that, let alone understand it, we should certainly be humble about predicting the future. I don't think any of the programmers who wrote that cobalt code back in the seventies had any damn idea that in 2025 checks were still being cut off the business logic that they had encoded back then.\n\nBut that just brings me to the conclusion on the question for what should a young programmer do? You're not gonna be able to predict the future. No one's gonna be able to predict, predict the future. If you like programming, you should learn programming. Now, is that gonna be a career forever? I don't know, but what's gonna be a career forever? Who knows? Like a second ago, we thought that it was the blue collar labor that was gonna be extracted. First, it was the robots that were gonna take over. Then Gen AI comes out, and then all the artists suddenly look like, holy shit, is this gonna do all animation? Now it's gonna do all music. Now they get real scared, and now I see the latest Tesla robot going like, oh, maybe we're back now to blue collar being in trouble. Because if it can dance like that, it can probably fix a toilet.\n\nSo no one knows anything. And you have to then position yourself for the future in such a way that it doesn't matter that you pick a profession or path where if it turns out that you have to retool and re-skill, you're not gonna regret the path you took. That's a general life principle for me, how I look at all endeavors I involved myself in is I want to be content with all outcomes. When we start working on a new product at 37 Signals, I set up my mental model for its success and I go, do you know what? If no one wants this, I will have had another opportunity to write Beautiful Ruby Code, to explore Greenfield domain, to learn something new, to build a system I want, even if no one else wants it.\n\nWhat a blessing, what a privilege. If a bunch of people want it, that's great. We can pay some salaries, we can keep the business running. And if it's a blow weight success, wonderful. I get to impact a bunch of people.\n\nI think one of the big open questions to me is how far you can get with Vibe coding, whether an approach for a young developer to invest most of the time into Vibe coding or into writing code from scratch. So Vibe coding meaning, so I'm leaning into the meme a little bit, but the Vibe coding, meaning you generate code, you have the this idea of a thing you want to create, you generate the code and then you fix it with both natural language to the prompts and manually you learn enough to manually fix it. So that's the learning process. How you fix code that's generated, or you j you write code from scratch and have the LMS kind of tab, tap, tab add extra code.\n\nLike which part do you lean on? I think to be safe, you should find the the beauty and the, the artistry and the skill in both right from scratch. So like there should be some percent of your time just writing from scratch and some percent by coding. There should\n\nBe more of the time writing from scratch. If you are interested in learning how to program, unfortunately you're not gonna get fit by watching fitness videos. You're not gonna learn how to play the guitar by watching YouTube guitar videos. You have to actually play yourself. You have to do the situps programming, understanding learning, almost anything requires you to do. Humans are not built to absorb information in a way that transforms into skills by just watching others from afar. Now ironically, it seems AI is actually quite good at that, but humans are not. If you wanna learn how to become a competent programmer, you have to program. It's really not that difficult to understand.\n\nNow I understand the temptation and the temptation is there because Vibe coding can produce things perhaps in this moment, especially in a new domain you're not familiar with, with tools you don't know perfectly well, that's better than what you could do or that you would take much longer to get at. But you're not gonna learn anything. You're gonna learn in this superficial way that feels like learning, but is completely empty calories. And secondly, if you can just vibe code it, you're not a programmer, then anyone could do it, which may be wonderful. That's essentially what happened with the Access database. That's what happened with Excel. It took the capacity of accountants to become software developers because the tools became so accessible to them that they could build a model for how the business was gonna do next week that required a programmer prior to Excel.\n\nNow it didn't because they could do it themselves. Vibe coding enables non-programmers to explore their ideas in a way that I find absolutely wonderful. But it doesn't make you a programmer,\n\nI agree with you, but I wanna allow for room for both of us to be wrong. For example, there could be Vibe, coding could actually be a skill that if you train it and by Vibe coding, let's include the the the step of correction, the iterative correction, yes, it's possible if you give really good at that, that you're outperforming the people that right from scratch that you can come up with truly innovative things, especially at this moment in history. While the LLMs are a little bit too dumb to create super novel things and a complete product, but they're starting to creep close to that. So if you are investing time now into becoming a really good vibe coder, maybe this is the right thing to do as if, if it's indeed a skill, we kind of meme about Vibe coding, just like sitting back and in the, it's in the name, but if you treat it seriously, a competitive vibe coder and get good at riding the wave of AI and get good at the skill of editing code versus writing code from scratch, it's possible that you can actually get farther in the long term.\n\nMaybe editing is a fundamentally different task than writing from scratch if you take that seriously as a skill that you develop. I see. I don't, to me that's an open question. I just think I'm, I personally, now you're on another level, but just me, just, just personally, I'm not as good at editing the code that I didn't write. That's a different, no one is, no one is of this generation, but, but maybe that's a skill. Maybe if you get on the same page as the ai, 'cause there's a consistency to the ai. It's like it really is a pair programmer with a consistent style and structure and so on.\n\nPlus, with your own prompting, you can control the kind of work code you write. I mean, it could generally be a skill like\n\nThat's the dream of the prompt engineer. I think it's a complete pipe dream. I don't think editors exist that aren't good at writing. I've written a number of books. I've had ANU of professional editors. Not all of them wrote their own great books, but all of them were great writers in some regard. Give someone pointers if difficult for an editor to be able to spot what's wrong with a problem if you that it couldn't make the solution themselves. Editing, in my opinion, is the reward, the capacity to be a good editor is the reward you get from being a good doer.\n\nYou have to be a doer first. Now, that's not the same as saying that Vibe coding, prompt engineering won't be able to produce fully formed amazing systems even shortly. I think that's entirely possible. But then there's no skill left, which maybe is the greatest payoff at all. Wasn't that the whole promise of AI anyway, that it was just all natural language that even my clumsy way of formulating a question could result in a beautiful, succinct answer. That actually to me is a much more appealing vision that there's gonna be these special prompt engineering wizards who know how to tickle the AI just right to produce what they want. The beauty of AI is to think that someone who doesn't know the first thing about how AI actually works is able to formulate their idea and their aspirations for what they want, and the AI could somehow take that messy clump of ideas and produce something that someone wants.\n\nThat's actually what programming has always been. There's very often been people who didn't know how to program, who wanted programs, who then hired programmers, who gave them messy descriptions of what they wanted. And then when the programmers delivered that back said, oh no, actually that's not what I meant. I want something else. AI may be able to provide that cycle if that happens to the fullest extent of it. Yeah, there's not gonna be as many programmers around, right? But hopefully, presumably someone still, at least for the foreseeable future, have to understand whether what the AI is producing actually works or not. As\n\nA interesting case study, maybe a thought experiment. If I wanted to vibe code Basecamp or or Hay and some of the, some of the products you, you you've built, like what would be the bottle legs? What, what, where would I fail? Along the way,\n\nWhat I've seen when I've been trying to do this, trying to use Vibe coding to build something real is you actually failed really early. The Vibe coding is able to build a veneer at the current present moment of something that looks like it works, but it's flawed in all sorts of ways. There are the obvious ways, the meme, ways that it's leaking all your API keys, it's storing your password in plain text. I think that's ultimately solvable. Like it's gonna figure that out or at least it's gonna get better at that, but its capacity to get lost in its own labyrinth is very great right now. You let it code something and then you wanna change something and it becomes a game of whack-a-mole. Real quick, Peter Levels who've been doing this wonderful flight simulator was talking to that where at a certain scale, the thing just keeps biting its own tail.\n\nYou wanna fix something and it breaks five other things, which I think is actually uniquely human because that's how most bad programmers are at the certain level of complexity with the domain. They can't fix one thing without breaking three other things. So in that way I'm actually, in some way it's almost a positive signal for that. The AI's gonna figure this out because it's done an extremely human trajectory right now. The kind of mistakes it's making are the kind of mistakes that junior programmers make all the time. Yeah.\n\nCan we zoom out and look at the vision, the manifesto, the doctrine of Rails? What are some of the things that make a programming language a a framework? Great, especially for web development. So we talked about happiness. Yes. The underlying objective of Ruby. What else?\n\nSo you're looking at the nine points I wrote out in I think 2012 and first, before we dive into 'em, I wanna say the reason I wrote it down is that if you want a community to, you have to record its values and you have to record its practices. If you don't, eventually you're gonna get enough new people come in who have their own ideas of where this thing should go. And if we don't have a a guiding light helping us to make decisions, we're gonna start flailing. We're gonna start actually falling apart. I think this is one of the key reasons that institutions of all kinds start falling apart. We forget why Chesterton's fence is there. We just go like, why is that fence there?\n\nLet's yank it out. Oh, it was to keep the wolves out. Now we're all dead. Oops. So I wanted to write these things down and if we just take them quick one by one, you talked about optimizing for programmer happiness. I put that at number one in homage of mats, and that's a lot about accepting that there is occasionally a trade-off between writing Beautiful code and other things we want outta systems. There could be a runtime trade off, there can be a performance trade-off, but we're gonna do it nonetheless. We're also going to allow ambiguity in a way that many programmers by default are uncomfortable with. I give the example actually here of in the interactive Ruby Shell where you can play with the language or even interact with your domain model.\n\nYou can quit it in two ways, at least that I found. You can write exit, boom, you're outta the program, you can write quit, boom, you're outta the program. They do the same thing. We just wrote both exit or the people who built that wrote both Exit and quit because they knew humans were likely to pick one or the other. Python is the perfect contrast to this. In the Python interactive protocol, if you write exit, it won't exit. It'll give you a fucking lesson. It'll basically tell you to read the fucking manual. It says use exit parentheses or control DIE, end of file to exit. I'm like, one is very human and another is very engineer.\n\nAnd I mean that both of them in the best possible way, Python is pedantic python's. The value from the start stated is that there should be preferably one and only one way to do a certain thing. Ruby goes the complete opposite. No, we want the full expression that fits different human brains such that it seems like the language is guessing just what they want.\n\nAnd part of that is also you described the principle of Lisa Prize, which is a difficult thing to engineer into a language because you have to kind of, it's a subjective thing. What is,\n\nWhich is why you can't do it in one way, which is why I used the example of both Exit and Quit. The principle of Lisa Surprise for some people would be like, oh, exit. That's how I get out of the prompt. For other people it'd be quit. Why don't we just do both?\n\nOkay, so what's the convention over configuration? That's a big one.\n\nThat's a big one. That's a huge one. And it was born out of a frustration I had in the early days with especially Java frameworks, where when you were setting up a web application framework for Java back in the day, it was not uncommon to literally write hundreds if not thousands of lines of XML configuration files.",

      "transcript_chunk": "Have you ever found yourself agitated or confounded or just sick of the current state of affairs and wondered What It might be like to live in another time?\n\nI do not belong to this time period. I know it sounds crazy, but when I wore armor and I'm sitting in front of a castle in Germany or in Poland, I felt like I belonged there. You know, I I I feel at home\n\nFor some people. Home is in the Middle Ages.\n\nIt appears to be a simpler time. People worked hard and played hard. It seems exotic to us. Now\n\nThe exotic place these people are in is New Jersey at the Burlington County Fairgrounds. It's a warm sticky Sunday in June and they are attending the annual New Jersey Renaissance Fair, fair with an E at the end. Despite the heat, they're wearing woolen vests and long sleeved dresses, heavy boots also among the men, a lot of very bushy beards. Matt Schwarz is one of the musical performers. He is a harpist.\n\nI think nowadays you look at a world that doesn't have a lot of our modern problems and you think it was perfect. Of course back then they had their own problems. But I think there's much to be said with a world in which you're in touch with, with the outdoors in nature.\n\nJordan Cavalier is another musical performer.\n\nThis is called the Nickel Harpa. It's a Swedish key fiddle. It's 16 strings of medial Swedish glory. It has three melody strings, one drone string, and 12 sympathetic strings. I started playing six years ago and now I'm here refa playing it. This is like my life. Now,\n\nIn the US alone there are a couple hundred Renaissance fairs. Each year they give you a chance to hear period music, eat a Turkey leg or a giant pickle and pretend that you are not only in a different time, but that you are a different person.\n\nI am so Magan the Night of Fortitude, part of the night of Virtue, soon to fight in the Tournament of Virtue here at one 30 on the field.\n\nOkay, so there's two nights on like different horses on opposing sides and they're, they have like their jousting stick and they're trying to get the rings, so whichever one gets the rings, they get the point.\n\nAnother night Paul Mahaffey emerges from his jousting tournament, sweaty and winded.\n\nIt's almost been a year since I armored up and I love it. There's, it was exhausting, but I could do it again. In 10 minutes, the adrenaline gets going and you just get in there. It's just you and him. That's all you see. 'cause you can't see anything else in the helmet and it's great.\n\nOkay, so that's what they're all doing here. What are we doing here? When we set out to make a three part series about the arc of human life, we knew we would begin with birth and child rearing. That was last week's episode. You can catch up later if you missed it. We also knew that the final episode would be about aging and death, but what about the middle episode? We thought it would be interesting to explore what it's like to be middle Aged, but then you realize that our current concept of middle Aged is very new. At the beginning of the 20th century, average life expectancy was only 31 years old. Now that number on its own is misleading. There were plenty of old people and middle Aged people too, but the average was brought down by the incredibly high rate of child mortality.\n\nSo we got to wondering what was it like to be middle Aged back in the Middle Ages? And we asked the Renaissance fair attendees a simple question. If you could go back, would you go back?\n\nI'd rather be middle Aged in pretty much any century in the Middle Ages. That was rough, rough time.\n\nI would've not survived anything. No, I need like a Marriott, but I need like a JW Marriott. I don't even survive this when it rains.\n\nSo we have this thing today called ibuprofen that is a very, very powerful help to being middle Aged.\n\nSo that's how the Fairgoers feel today on Freakonomics Radio, we get an expert view on What It was like to be middle Aged in the Middle Ages. Ibuprofen not\n\nIncluded.\n\nThis is Freakonomics Radio, the podcast that explores the hidden side of everything with your host Steven Dubner.\n\nThe Middle Ages as agreed upon by most historians, cover the years from roughly 500 to 1500. Most historians also agree that renaissance fairs are not entirely accurate, so we decided to speak with a couple of actual historians.\n\nMy name is Nele Hja and I teach medieval history at Columbia University.\n\nHow would you describe generally your research interests?\n\nMy research interests are mostly in religious history of the Middle Ages, specifically history of Christianity. But because religion is so pervasive in the medieval world, basically every other type of history falls into the religious history that is social history, political history and everything. So I basically study everything.\n\nHow did you come to this particular concentration?\n\nMy story is a little bit unusual really, because I actually graduated from college as an industrial engineer. Oh,\n\nSorry. Yeah, that's a change.\n\nThat is a change. But then in the last year of engineering, I had read Umberto Echo's name of the Rose, and there I met for the first time the Franciscan order. What is special about Franciscan order is that they really wanted to be poor, very, very poor, poorer than everybody else. And I thought, who on earth might like to be poor? That seemed to me so strange, such a great contrast to modern life when everybody wants to be rich. I was very fascinated from the beginning with the monks and friars life now. I see a lot of problems in that kind of life that I didn't see before.\n\nFor instance,\n\nFor instance, no matter how hard they try, their passions and moral issues do not leave them. We think that the monks are calm and peaceful, dedicating their lives to God. But when you read the sources, it's not like that. They are very much acting. They\n\nCould be angry and horny.\n\nExactly. And corrupt and greedy.\n\nOkay, so that's Nestle shek, our first scholar of the Middle Ages. Let's meet the other one.\n\nMy name's Philip Schofield. I am a medieval historian at Abes with,\n\nThat's a university in Wales.\n\nMy main interests are in the broad air of economic history and I work particularly on peasantry.\n\nWhat would you say drew you to the study of peasantry?\n\nAs an undergraduate, I was really intrigued by the broad socioeconomic history that medievals, especially in France were doing, looking at the social structure of medieval villages.\n\nWhen I read about the work of archeologists and others who find physical evidence or ruins, it always seems a bit miraculous that things have survived from so long ago and yet it does happen. When you study economic history, I'm curious what the evidence is like and if it feels as though you're always reaching through a veil of sorts. Never quite getting to the reality.\n\nThat's always the sense. On one level, when I was doing my doctorate, I wrote at one stage something like, he probably thought that, and my supervisor, someone called Barbara Harvey, she said, what are you doing? You don't probably think it. You either know it or you don't know it, and if you don't know it, leave it out. That's sort of old school, but I it, it appeals to me really. I imagine if I walked through a 14th century peasant village on the basis of my understanding from 14th century records, there's undoubtedly a lot of things that would surprise me. But there are local court records, manorial records that are really the records generated by Lords, but include a huge amount of incidental information directed at the peasantry, including, for example, litigation.\n\nThat's something I work on quite a bit, is actually peasants not litigating with their lords, but peasants litigating with each other.\n\nI asked Philip Schofield if he was willing to imagine the daily life of a middle Aged peasant from that era, maybe a composite figure based on bits and pieces of schofield's research. He was actually able to do us one better than that.\n\nI did write something almost 30 years ago now in a journal called Past and Present about two peasants who litigated. So they're both real people and because they were extremely enthusiastic litigants, they tended to be more evident. And because they were relatively wealthy, they were also more evident and they also exist in taxation data. So that's the kind of person I would maybe go to.\n\nExcellent. Of these two peasant litigants, I need you to pick one that you can describe for us. Who would you prefer?\n\nI will pick someone called Robert, the son of Adam.\n\nOkay. Robert, the son of Adam. Where does he live?\n\nHe lived in a place called Hindu Clay in Suffolk.\n\nAnd what year would you like to place Robert, the son of Adam in Hindu clay. That would count as his middle age,\n\nLet's say about 1305. I hope he's not dead by then. He was certainly active around that time and was doing pretty well.\n\nHow old is he?\n\nI would say he was probably in his thirties.\n\nAnd that counts as middle Aged then?\n\nI think so, yeah. I was thinking about this today and what I know about calculations of life expectancy, most of that is really hard to do from the records I've describing, but it's really monastic evidence from the 15th century where you've got a whole range of moments in amongst life in places like Westminster Abbey and Durham, cathedral, priory and so on. And then you can follow them through various administrative tasks and then often they end up in the infirmary and their desks are recorded. The estimates for that tend to suggest that life expectancy is taking people into the late forties. 50.\n\nOkay. We will return later to Robert, son of Adam, a relatively wealthy peasant in hinder Clay, England. I asked Nestle Shaza who grew up in Turkey, what it's like to really immerse yourself in medieval history.\n\nIt gives you perspective, it gives you an alternative. It takes you out of the bubble, which is modern life. When we grow up, we are born into this life. We sometimes think that this is the only way things could be, but it could have been another way.\n\nSo if I asked you to switch places with someone from that period, would you be would willing or interested?\n\nIf I'm going to have my kids with me, yes. If certain conditions are met, I guess I would, yeah. 'cause it's a much simpler life. I'd like to be an artisan in a city, I guess. Mm.\n\nWhat would you make?\n\nStained glass would be nice. I mean, stained glass is so beautiful. People in the Middle Ages had their shops actually inside their homes, so I don't have to even go somewhere else.\n\nWhere exactly would you choose to live?\n\nLet's make it Italy.\n\nIn a city or rural?\n\nIt has to be a city, really. Italian cities were much more advanced in the 13th century. Much better organized. You have free healthcare, free education. If I'm rural than I would have to be peasant.\n\nAnd you want to be an artisan? Yes,\n\nI'd rather be an artisan. I think being a peasant requires far too much energy, which I don't think I have.\n\nLet's start with the city. Where will you live?\n\nWell, I quite like Florence, so it would have to be Florence.\n\nWhat year shall we pick? 12?\n\nFifties would be good\n\nIn real life today. Do you have a spouse or partner?\n\nI do have a spouse, yes. And he's Italian actually.\n\nSo Nestle shek has raised the stakes by including herself in our exercise and she's bringing along her husband and two sons. I asked Philip Scofield what we know about the family of Robert, the son of Adam.\n\nHe's got a brother. Beyond that, it's difficult to be entirely sure. We do know from other contemporaries that if he was fairly typical, he would have a wife and maybe a small number of surviving children, some of whom would survive into adulthood. So it's quite reasonable to suppose that he had three or four children who moved beyond infancy.\n\nWhat do his children do? At what age do they start to perhaps work with him? Well,\n\nThey were still really young, you know, less than 10. So small scale herding, managing crops, keeping birds off things, helping with harvest and so on.\n\nWhat level of education would these kids be getting?\n\nEducation is fairly limited. A lot of education is the education of the village in a sense of learning from doing in some ways. What\n\nDoes Robert eat and drink?\n\nThe bulk of his diet would've been predominantly grain-based, but leavened by fish, both sea fish and fresh water. Fish, maybe a little bit of meat, probably bacon, but also poultry. Quite a lot of ale in his diet.\n\nIs there a relatively low alcohol version of ale that children and others would drink since it was safer than water? I mean\n\nChildren are drinking ale, definitely. Whether it's low alcohol or not, it's difficult to be entirely sure.\n\nObviously in Florence you would have access to very good wine. What\n\nWould a family dinner look like?\n\nIt would definitely have vegetables and fruit. Meat is a little bit more problematic for medieval people 'cause it's expensive. Pork and chicken would be cheaper than beef, so we might have that maybe once a week. People did consume a lot of beans and lentils and things like that. Also because they were durable, they don't go bad. We wouldn't obviously have any fridge or anything, not even a cellar. But also, of course the main staple of any diet is the bread.\n\nSay a bit more about why you are determined to put yourself in a city and not a village or the countryside.\n\nThe big difference is that you are much less exposed to the elements. City life is pretty safe compared to the rural life because the cities are walled. They're very well protected in the countryside. You do get raid, you might have animals coming in, wild animals, which were much more in number in the Middle Ages than they are now. Obviously they've been hunted down over the years. There is food insecurity in the countryside. I wouldn't have food insecurity because generally what the medieval cities like Florence did, they had big granaries. They stored grain just in case there's famine and then they would distribute it to the citizens.\n\nLet's talk about the state of commerce. How does that work? How much do you make and what are you able to buy with it?\n\nI would have to find commissioned jobs. If I'm a stain glass maker, that would mean either a church or a monastery would have to gimme orders. There are lots of churches, many more than now. And if a church can afford having stained glass, which would be expensive, I think I can make decent amount of money to be what corresponds today to middle class.\n\nOkay, so you're a middle class, middle Aged artisan in the Middle Ages. Yes.\n\nThat's a lot of middle.\n\nThat's okay. That's why we're here. What is it like to be a freelance artisan then?\n\nWell, the thing is I would have to enter the guilt of stained glass makers. All the trades were very well organized. Today's trade unions, they really have their origins in the Middle Ages, so I would have to pay dues to my gu. I would have to be registered as a master of state class, and the amount of money I can charge would be regulated by them.\n\nWhen you read economic history, the economists are usually anti guild because they see guilds as monopolistic within their domain. There was actually this famous economic essay about how the Candlemakers guild were trying to have a resolution passed that forbade the sun from shining at certain times because with too much sunlight there was less demand for their products plainly. That was not quite real, but the sentiment I think was legitimate. I'm curious, how would you feel about your guild? Would you feel it's generally a positive for you and for the rest of society, positive for you and a negative for the others, and maybe even negative for you because you have to join this guild and pay dues and have your wages probably set as opposed to being a true freelancer?\n\nWell, I'm not inflicted with the aire ideas of the modern economy, which I consider a good thing. The guild is a very good thing for the people inside it. (1)",

      "transcript_chunk": "Hey there, it's S Steven Dubner. We just republished a three-part series called Everything You Never Knew About Whaling. We spoke with economists, historians, Moby Dick Scholar, and an environmental activist whose mission in life is to stop whale hunting. We also tried to speak with a whale hunter, but public sentiment against whaling is so strong that most modern whalers don't wanna speak with the press. Also, there just aren't that many whalers around anymore. In the 1960s, at the peak of industrial whale hunting, thousands of whalers in more than a dozen countries were killing tens of thousands of whales a year. Today commercial whaling happens in only three countries, Norway, Iceland, and Japan.\n\nAnd collectively they only kill about a thousand whales a year. There just isn't much demand for whale meat, it turns out, and even less for whale oil. Anyway, we couldn't get a modern whaler to go on the record with us, but then right as we were finishing our series, we landed our white whale, Bjorn Anderson, one of the biggest whalers in Norway. The Norwegian government allows for the harvest of 1400 minka whales a year. The minka is plentiful. It's not at all an endangered species. Even so, Anderson and his fellow whalers usually take less than half of the allowed quota each year. Like I said, just not much demand for whale meat these days.\n\nWhen we caught up with Anderson back in 2023, he just finished his whaling season. In the conversation you're about to hear, he tells us why he loves hunting whales and how he does it. Why harvesting whales is important to maintaining the supply of fish and why he thinks that in the future there will be more whale hunting and not less. It's coming up on this bonus episode of Freakonomics Radio starting now.\n\nThis is Freakonomics Radio, the podcast that explores the hidden side of everything with your host Steven Dubner.\n\nOkay, Bjorn, it's Steven. You can hear me okay?\n\nYes, I hear you.\n\nI'm sorry to interrupt your holiday. Yes, you're on holiday in Sweden.\n\nYes, I am outside. So the home in the middle of Sweden, we have to go to my wife's home place.\n\nAnd what do you do when you're there on holiday?\n\nCutting grass.\n\nDo you do any fishing?\n\nNo, it's holiday\n\nNow. Where in Norway do you live\n\nIn Lofo? In the Westly part of Lofo. On the water we live on small islands.\n\nIs that where you grew up?\n\nYes.\n\nDid you grow up in a fishing family?\n\nYes, my father was a fisherman and a whale hunter.\n\nAnd can you tell me about your work now you're mostly a fisherman and then you whale. During the whale season\n\nIn 1st of January we start fishing cold. When it comes to spring April or something like that, we start Mickey whale hunting and that go on to the summer. After summer we go to shipyard to repair and fix the boat, and in the autumn we fish herring.\n\nSo of the three things that you catch mostly cod, whale and herring, which makes you the most money?\n\nIt depends. Cod and herring are this year the best.\n\nHow was your whale season this year? How many whales did you get?\n\n111 whale.\n\nWow. Holy cow. So you alone are responsible for like 25% of all the whales taken in Norway this year? Yeah. Yeah. So 111, how many trips was that?\n\nFour trips.\n\nCan you describe how you sell it then? Who do you sell it to?\n\nWell, it's company I'm co-owner in and then we distribute it to all the Norway to the stores. So they export some whale to Japan.\n\nOne thing that confuses me is I read that the Norwegian quota for minka whale in a year is a thousand, but that all of you collectively, all the whalers only take like five or 600 in a year. So why are you not getting up to the quota? Is it just not worth it? Are there not enough whalers?\n\nIt's a problem to distribute and get it in the store everywhere and people have to buy it.\n\nWhat about the price of whale me over the past few years? It goes up, it goes down. Where is it?\n\nNo, it's going up but not in that speed. We want the price of wame have rise every year almost, but not enough. It's about one third or one fourth of our income.\n\nDoes the government subsidize fishing and whaling?\n\nNo.\n\nNot at all. No. Are there any price guarantees for the fish or the whale that you catch?\n\nYes. All fisheries in Norway have a a guarantee minimum price. It's regulated by law.\n\nIs it usually sold for more than that anyway?\n\nYes. Often it's over there minimum price.\n\nBut the minimum price is useful to you just in case the prices fall? Yeah,\n\nIt's useful for everybody because you don't have those ups and downs. Everybody are jealous on our fishermen today because it has been quite good to be a fisherman in the last 20 years now because we have had quite good quotas and good money.\n\nSo what would happen to you if Norway decided that they don't want to allow anyone to hunt whales anymore?\n\nIf they do, they are crazy. Some years from now there will be no code or no herring to fish because there are so many whales. That's the food for the whale. Mickey whale is a opportunist. We eat even salmon and cold and herring and everything. If you hunt whale, you can fish more fish because you have the balance in the ecosystem.\n\nDo you know how many Mka whales there are in the world?\n\nThe latest number is 150,000\n\nIn the world,\n\nNot in the world. In the North Atlantic.\n\nI saw a number, this was a few years ago that said there were maybe half a million of Antarctic mka stocks. Does anyone talk about the mka whale as endangered at all?\n\nThat must be people who don't know anything about the sea. Because if you are going to the coast of northern and Trumps and Finmark, you can see Minky whale and humpback and fin whale all the spring and summer in the autumn. If you number out how much minke whale eat, if there are 150,000 minky whales, it'll be about 50 to 60,000 ton each day of fish they have study the number of how much the sea animal including birds and everything eats in a year.\n\nIt's 25 million tons of food and the fishermen only take 4 million tons.\n\nWhen you get the whale, you kill the, you bring the whale on board the boat and you open up the stomach.

So do you think the save the whales movement that started in the 1970s, do you think it's gone too far? That there are too many whales that are eating too much of the fish supply that people eat?\n\nYes. It'll come to that soon.\n\nSo when someone says to you, Bjorn, I like whales, I don't want any whales to be killed, what do you say to them?\n\nNo, I don't like to kill them. It's for food. A mke whale is very close related to a cow because the mke whale has four stomach. So I cannot see any difference to kill a cow or killer, a mke whale.\n\nThe the entire commercial whaling industry, Norway, Japan, Iceland, wherever kills only about a thousand whales a year. But hundreds of thousands of whales are dying every year from plastic pollution and noise pollution and boat strikes, and most of all from getting caught up in fishing gear. But it seems that most of the protests by environmental activists is directed at you at the commercial whalers. Why do you think that is?\n\nIt's a human's bad conscious due to environmental stuff.\n\nDo you consider yourself an environmentalist?\n\nYes.\n\nDo you think of yourself as a conservationist?\n\nYes. I think it's common sense. If you harvest nature, you have to make sure that there are growing up things to hunt or to harvest next year.\n\nSo what do you say to someone who thinks that they are being a perfect moral person? Right, and says that no one should ever kill whales.\n\nGet some understanding of the nature. It's simple like that. They don't understand the nature. They believe more on Walt Disney or something like that. I have not so much to say about that because I am just fed up with them. They're also wrong in many, many places. Stop the plastic pollution we have now. They should have work for stopping plastic pollution many, many years ago. And even petrol, the global warming is also a a big issue. We don't know what's happening in the years to come.\n\nThey should have done more work on those. Issue has really become a problem for us. Minky whale or whale hunting is not a problem. It was a problem for the whale some year, so many years ago. Now it's no problem with the whale stock.\n\nDo you think the International Whaling Commission did a good job years ago when they tried to regulate the number of whales that could be killed?\n\nThey didn't do their job.\n\nWhy not?\n\nThey are a organization based on the scientific comte and the scientific Comte said there was enough mke whale. So they should have given out quota on Mke whale, but they didn't.\n\nSo what would happen if everyone in the world were allowed to hunt MCO whale starting next year? Would that be a problem for the MCO whale population?\n\nOf course you have to do a regulation, you have to count them. You have to give out quota and and do it sustainable.\n\nI've read that whalers wanted the fisheries ministry in Norway to promote whaling and wail me, but that it didn't work. That they were worried that trading partners would get upset. Do you know anything about that?\n\nYes, I was one of those who wanted to him to respond on that, but he didn't.\n\nHave you ever been to the US Bjorn?\n\nYes.\n\nWhere did you go?\n\nNew York.\n\nYeah, that's where I am. Did you like New York?\n\nYes, because I study engineering, high power electricity engineering. So we was visit Con Edison in New York.\n\nAnd you were working as an engineer then?\n\nYes.\n\nWho did you work for?\n\nNo, K. It was a power plant. Yes, we produced about 3% of Norwegian electricity.\n\nSo why did you stop working as an engineer and become a full-time fisherman?\n\nIt's a much better way of life. You are free and you are out. You can see the nature, you can see whales, you can see other fish, and you can feel the weather, bad weather or good weather in a much better way than you do in the office.\n\nWhen you came to New York, did you go into the rural areas at all or just the city?\n\nNo, we were just in New York.\n\nOkay. So if you had gone upstate into New York, you would see a lot of deer. And in the US some species of deer are considered a nuisance animal for a lot of reasons. They eat crops, they spread disease, they cause car crashes. And so hunting of deer is encouraged. There's a season and there's a limit. Do you see the mka whale as sort of a nuisance animal like that?\n\nNo. It's a source of food, but you have to try to balance the ecosystem as good as you can because then it'll produce the most. We have to harvest our resources in a sensible way. If you don't shoot well, the ecosystem will collapse sooner or later\n\nAfter the break. How exactly does Bjorn Anderson harvest those resources? You\n\nHave to think like a whale.\n\nI'm Steven Dubner. This is Freakonomics Radio. We'll be right back.\n\nSmartless (16m 49s):\nHey, this is Will Anette, host of Smartless.

How big is the ship? What's it called?\n\nThe boat is called Buen and it's a 32 meter long steel boat.\n\nAnd the name of the boat Buen. What does that mean?\n\nMy father was grown up on Rena. It's a place in Fulton, Rena Boen. It's like a man who lived on that place.\n\nDid you grow up wanting to be a whaler when you were a kid?\n\nYes, I was five years. First time I saw a while was shot. I it was very excited.\n\nWhy did you get talked into becoming an engineer then?\n\nThey both stopped in the whale hunting. So yeah, I didn't know what to do.\n\nThis was in 1986 when the International Whaling Commission put a moratorium on commercial whaling. But in 1992, Norway announced it would resume hunting minko whales In defiance of that ban Anderson, who was by then working as an engineer for a power company, was able to get back to his first love.\n\nI think that was a very good decision because the culture and the know-how starting to disappear and it could be very hard for the coastal people here in Norway.\n\nDo you have kids Bjorn?\n\nNo.\n\nDo you have young crew members that are going to become like you? A whaling boat captain?\n\nYes. They just finished school and they started to onboard a ship and learn to catch whale or fish. Some are good or some are bad. Yeah,\n\nYeah, yeah. You're good.\n\nYes. My father alerted me everything. You have to have a good interest in what you're doing and it's whatever you do. If you don't have the interest, you will be not so good.\n\nWhat about the crew size on your boat?\n\nWe are six people all year.\n\nThey work for you year round the same six?\n\nYeah.\n\nDo they live in your town\n\nNearby?\n\nWhat's the longest you've ever gone from land then?\n\n2, 3, 4 weeks? We have been on the north side of Bergen, almost 81 degrees north.\n\nWhen you're out on the water, can you describe how you locate the minka whale?\n\nWe only use our eyes.\n\nWow. No sonar, nothing like that? (1)",

      "transcript_chunk": "dit is that it applies only to employees who spend at least 80% of their time in a customer facing role. So a restaurant can pool their tips and distribute them among the wait staff, bartenders and hostesses, but not the kitchen crew.\n\nI might think twice if I believe that the legislature was going to create a new law that permitted tips to be shared everywhere. That has not happened. But even if they did do that, it would still lead me to say this is not a professional way to treat people. Tipping in and of itself I don't think fosters the professionalism that we're looking for in our industry. If you think about every industry where tipping happens, it's often not a full-time career. I don't tip my airline pilot or my lawyer or my teacher or the person who's interviewing me on their podcast. That's a profession\n\nPodcasting a profession. Anyway, for all these reasons, Danny Meyer decided to eliminate tipping at all his restaurants.\n\nWe've converted about one every four to six months. We just have one more to go.\n\nOkay, so let's talk about what you've learned.\n\nWell, I think the biggest thing we've learned is that this is really tough and it's tough because it's really a three legged stool that we're trying to balance. How do you create a menu price that doesn't frighten away a prospective customer who's just casually looking up your restaurant online and may not understand that there will be no tipping on top of that? And then did you actually compensate your team to the degree that you hope to? And now the third leg of the stool is, did you actually make enough money to cover all of the costs involved?\n\nWhat can you tell us about your restaurant revenues before and after hospitality included?\n\nWell, I can tell you that our revenues are decidedly higher, but keep in mind we started charging 21% more roughly on all of our prices. So if they were not at least 21% higher, that would be a big fail. What I can also tell you is that the compensation for our staff members, both formerly tipped employees and never tipped employees, has also gone up quite a bit.\n\nSo if one of the goals was to even out the pay between the people cooking the food and the people serving the food, how much have you closed that gap?\n\nHere's what I know, Steven. The earning potential before we started hospitality included was 2.4 times more for tipped employees than for back of the house employees. Today it's 1.9 times more, so that's big. I can also say that the line cook wages, so the people who cook your food have gone up 37%. Front of house compensation formerly tipped employees has gone up 8%. So we've been able to increase both, but we've obviously in order to make some headway in terms of this discrepancy, have have increased back of the house pay by a lot more.\n\nRight, and and what's that mean in actual dollar terms for kitchen versus wait staff? Maybe you could use the modern as your example.\n\nWhen we started hospitality included in the aggregate, the front of the house employees at the modern were making somewhere around $22 an hour. And today that number is about $25 an hour. Believe it or not, a cook in the aggregate in 2015 was making just over $11 an hour. Today they're in 16 and a half dollars an hour. So that's a serious, serious hike.\n\nMeyer didn't share with us any profitability figures, so we don't know the degree to which these higher wages are eating into the restaurant's bottom lines, but at least in terms of wages, the hospitality included model sounds like it's working. Kitchen wages went up a lot, even wait, staff wages went up a little on average, but not everybody likes to be average.\n\nWhenever we've converted a restaurant, we would experience as much as a 30 to 40% turnover in our legacy staff. And I completely understand why that is, because the way that you got a raise in a tipped house was to have stayed at the restaurant longer than anyone else, which meant that you got the lucrative Thursday, Friday, Saturday night shifts, you know, and it may have taken you six or seven or eight years to earn that schedule,\n\nBut the new no tipping model made those shifts relatively less valuable, which for shorter tenured workers was a positive.\n\nOne of the real benefits is that you can make as much money working on a Monday night is on a Friday night because the way we compensate our team is a higher hourly rate, plus a revenue share model that averages out the entire week.\n\nAnd there was another benefit.\n\nI feel great about the fact that I no longer need to worry that the only way to get a great tip is to have a woman subjecting herself to leering men. Or if I'm from a different ethnic group than the table that I'm serving, that I need to worry that they're not gonna give me a good tip.\n\nBut if you think you hear a hint of disappointment in Meyer's voice, well, I'm not sure that's what we're hearing, but when he set out to eliminate tipping, he thought he was starting a revolution.\n\nYeah, well, we did not succeed at inspiring an entire industry to change its tune.\n\nThe no tipping initiative got a ton of media coverage. It was easy to think that a lot of restaurants were following suit.\n\nNot as many restaurants have moved away from tipping as you would get. The impression\n\nThat again is Michael Lin, the Cornell Tipping Scholar in\n\nThe seventies and eighties. There was a comparable tendency for a couple of restaurateurs that got a lot of press for it to eliminate tipping, and some of them survived and continued that policy, but the vast majority ended going back to tipping.\n\nDanny Meyer gets that.\n\nI've been pretty zealous about how I think tipping actually holds people back. But I also understand that movements happen in a big way when the economics work for everybody. And I don't think we're quite there yet. I completely understand it's not working yet for everybody.\n\nIf you were just having the idea today, having gone through what you've gone through the first few years of trying it, would you try it again or would you consider this an experiment in progress that while noble and smart, et cetera, et cetera is maybe too difficult that there's too much status quo overturn?\n\nWell, I think that's a fair question and the honest answer is I'm not sure. I think largely because of some of the notoriety of our making this initiative that has actually brought an awareness to the legislature, which is getting very, very close as I understand, to creating a situation where tips can be shared amongst everybody.\n\nWe conducted this interview in 2019 and New York State law has not changed since then. But even if it does and if back of house workers were to get a share of tips, it probably wouldn't eliminate tipping, might even strengthen the status quo. But Danny Meyer sees another development that might force a big change\n\nEach time. Minimum wage goes up, restaurants that are continuing to have a tipping system have all raised their prices to keep up with the minimum wage increases and then the guest is tipping 20% on top of that. So we're about one minimum wage hike away from a pricing advantage over other restaurants while we're paying our staff more. And I think that's the point when you're gonna start to see many, many restaurants eliminate tipping.\n\nA few months after my conversation with Danny Meyer, the pandemic shut down the entire restaurant industry. When Meyer's Restaurants reopened in July of 2020, the no tipping policy was no longer in effect. We don't know how often people will be eating out. Meyer told the New York Times, we do know that guests want to tip generously right now. Michael Lin at Cornell who once told us he would like to ban tipping, he is not so sure we will ever see the end. Why? Look,\n\nWhen I started doing research on tipping, I thought tips would be strongly related to service quality. But what I found was that about 4% of the variance in tips left by different groups can be explained by their ratings of service quality\n\nThat is in restaurants as in the tipping of Uber drivers. There was a weak correlation between quality of service and tip. But Lynn discovered something interesting in his research. A lot of restaurant servers think there's a strong correlation. About\n\nHalf of the servers in this country will say that they think their tips are moderately to strongly affected by the service they leave. They're wrong when they say that, but they believe it and because they believe it. Tipping in fact does provide an incentive to deliver better service for at least half of the servers in this country. So yes, my opinion about the incentive value of tipping as a system of compensation has changed over time. Although the facts haven't changed, I just learned more about it and begin to think a little bit more sophisticated about it.\n\nOkay. Did you follow that? Waiters and waitresses think their service significantly affects their tip even though the data shows it doesn't. But because waiters and waitresses think it does, they act as if it does. And Michael Lin found a similar dynamic from the customer side.\n\nTipping increases customer satisfaction. Customers expect service to be better under a tipping system and that can bias their perceptions. I've done a couple of studies based upon recent restaurants that have eliminated tipping. So for example, Joe's Crab Shack recently at several of its restaurants eliminated tipping. Most of them went back to tipping. Their online service ratings declined during the period that they had no tipping and went back up when they reinstituted tipping.\n\nDoes that mean the service actually got worse when there was no tipping?\n\nI don't know. I can't nail down precisely why it occurred. I believe it has to do with customers expect service to be better. I know that customers generally like lower prices and Joe's Crab Shack, when it eliminated tipping, it raised its prices.\n\nThis suggests that many restaurant customers are price sensitive and that they're so accustomed to seeing menus carrying a preti price that they'd prefer to see the low price and then tip, even though they'll end up paying the same or even more. The human mind is a funny thing, is it not? I'm\n\nLess likely to want to just ban tipping now because the data I have suggests that customers are happier with tipping. The press mostly focuses on this from the standpoint of servers, but by far the largest group that's impacted by tipping is customers. As much as people might grouse about tipping overall, it seems to increase consumer satisfaction. And since they outnumber employees by a wide margin, likely it's in society's benefit.\n\nSo Michael Lynn's research suggests that Danny Meyer's no tipping revolution will have to wait even longer. But Lynn's research did identify one category of restaurant that's ready for the transition,\n\nAnd that is really upscale restaurants that replace tipping with higher menu prices.\n\nAny examples,\n\nDanny Meyer's restaurants fall in that category. I think that the price sensitivity of his customers is lower. I also think that he's got a strong enough reputation that people won't anticipate lower service quality. It's a Danny Meyers restaurants. People will still expect good service even if there is no tipping.\n\nSo what have we learned other than the fact that tipping is among the most unpredictable economic activities on earth? I went back to John List to ask whether his research on Uber tipping says anything larger about the human condition.\n\nI think a first point that the data really highlight is that very few people will be continuously generous and consistently generous. I think that that just jumps out in the data. I think a broader point number two is the heterogeneity across people. You know, we oftentimes have people talking about, you know, well everyone's different, but we actually have a really good glimpse of an important part of our economy. And it shows you just how important things, like if you are a nice person and you get a nice rating that that spills over to this generosity that you can exhibit privately.\n\nI think that's sort of interesting because in psychology and in economics we found that a lot of behaviors don't spill over to different areas in our lives. So you know, you smoke, but then you wear a seatbelt. You're nice in one setting, but you're mean in the other. This sort of gives you a glimpse that there's some consistency in this generosity or being nice to another person that is much stronger than what I've seen in the past.\n\nJohn, what kind of a tipper are you?\n\nI'm an always tipper. I'm the 1%.\n\nAnd why is that? Is it that you want to give some of your money to those people or is it that you want to be for yourself, the kind of person who does that?\n\nI think it's both. I think that this is an important time to send wealth or income to another person who's doing a job such as this. But I also feel good about doing it. I have a warm glow and it makes me feel good inside that I'm not stiffing the person if\n\nJohn List is telling the truth and I have no reason to think he's not. This is interesting that an economist of all people always tips. Economists famous for knowing, as it said, the price of everything and the value of nothing. Economists who lecture the rest of us about utility and profit maximizing, about putting aside our pesky emotions when it's time to make a decision.\n\nI have a warm glow.\n\nA warm glow. The fact that an economist like John List always tips is I believe the best possible evidence of just how weird tipping truly is.

      "transcript_chunk": "tics as best as I could. The, as the Declaration of Independence says, with a decent respect to the opinions of mankind that like, so I should assume that you don't agree with me and in good faith.\n\nAnd so how in the hell am I gonna fix that? Like, I'm gonna have to make you accept that I'm not lying to you when I put these things together. If, if when you read that you feel like I I'm trying to get away with something, you're gonna put it down. And so I didn't write it for you to put it down. I think I wrote a thousand page book for you to put it down. I want you to get through all the way to the end going, God dang man. I didn't really realize it was as bad as all of that. So to convince the critics that's that's what is for as opposed to enough already, which I really wrote enough already for my people, my fans, to give to their brother-in-law and their dad and whoever. It's a little bit after the fact. As I said, I was in a real rush to get it done.\n\nSo I don't have the citations. I do have the citations in Fool's Air and about Afghanistan and actually we're working on now me and one of my guys at the institute we're working on putting the footnotes back into enough already Nice. And doing like the ultimate scholar edition with the overkill on the citations there. But I actually, I had footnotes on most of it. I turned them off and I just raced to the end 'cause I was outta money and I was out of time and I just had to go. And so friends of mine rationalize it like, well I think Bill O'Reilly has footnotes in his books. You know, get that thing out there man. And so I did. And, but I did try to write it in a way where I either cite my citations in the prose, or at least I wrote it in a way where it's a very specific claim.\n\nOn November the ninth they held a meeting and these five people were there and this is what they decided. So you can go and Google that. You know what I mean? It's not, it's, it should be specific enough that people can double check me. But, but then, yeah. So why I'm like this, I'm just a Ron Paul Guy and I can't stand being lied to and, and I can't stand all this violence and I wanna live in a free society and the empire's ruining it. And then, and then so why do I write, why am I like that meticulous about it all is I don't want to be caught being wrong. I'll tell you one funny story and then we'll stop. One time I lost an argument about Waco. It was these three people in my cab and the one of 'em was this real jerk and the other two were on his side 'cause it was his friends.\n\nAnd I was arguing with him about everything. But the thing was, he was like the son of a federal cop and he knew their side of the story like down pat and he really knew his stuff. And so even though I was right and he was wrong, he won and they got outta the car going, nah ha screw you, branch Chian boy and whatever. And oh man, that never happened to me again. You know why? Yeah. Because I read like six books about Waco. I already knew more than enough about it. And then I decided that, yeah, no, actually no one's gonna ever beat me in an argument about that ever again. Ever. So you can really thoroughly\n\nArticulate the Yeah. The evidence for your claims.\n\nAnd you're just like, me too dude. When when you read a 300 page book, it tasted what, like if you wanna read this thing, it's not like a chore, but like, oh, I wanna read that you're done a day and a half or two. Like it's easy to do. Once you set that precedent a few times, it's pretty easy to read a thing and jot down some notes and learn something from it and then teach it to somebody else and whatever. Well yeah, listen, welcome to adulthood or whatever. That's what we do. So like that's all it is. It's just that's my only job is compiling reasons to resent these liars and, and why to know better than all their false promises.\n\nYeah. But also you'd be able to, to articulate it\n\nAnd see also I'm a talk radio guy man. Yeah. And I grew up in the radio of Rush Limbaugh. I'm driving for a living in the era of Rush Limbaugh and g Gordon Liddy and all the local guys. And I mean the, I'll go ahead and say this on the record too. The local hosts on KLBJ AM and Austin all suck and always have all of them since Raleigh James in 9 96. Love her. Everybody since then, I mean I don't know who listens to KLBJ am at all, how they even stay in business at all. Their hosts suck.\n\nThe, the, the content of their awards are the actual raw skill of how they talk and what they talk and they\n\nAll of it. And mostly how stupid and wrong and horrible they are about everything. But also just how like meaningless their DR is. Right? You'd be in the middle of the world's worst crisis and they're like, the liberals are trying to take God out of the pledge of Allegiance. It's like, dude, I would prefer that you just shoot me in the face to listen to this for the love of God. Please. Yeah. But anyway, but I, I love the potential there. And in that era before the internet was what it is today, this is the real town square where you can have a host who knows something, you can have a guest who knows something and you can have callers who know a lot more than you think they would, dude. And I remember listening to them talk about like the Texas Homesteading Act that said you weren't allowed to take out a second mortgage on your house or whatever.\n\n'cause it was to protect the little old ladies. And they were debating over whether they should have that law or not. And I remember thinking, wow, all these people know so much about this topic that I've never heard of before. And all of these callers are just so deep on their knowledge of what they know and whether on that issue or so many other things. The first real time I heard Real AM Radio in Austin, I was 16, I was, wait, nah, I might've been old, I might've been 18. No, no, I would've, I was 16. It was, it was, yeah, it was the same year that the Davidians were killed. I was driving my first car down 180 3 and I said, you know, I've lived in Austin my whole life and I've never listened to the AM band. I wonder what it is. And the first thing I hit was KLBJ am And it was Johnny Walker, the great Johnny Walker, the FM rock and roll dj Yeah.\n\nWas self-hosting and his whole thing. He is a great guy, by the way, rip Johnny Walker. But he goes, look, I don't know anything. I'm literally just hosting this show. The guest is this guy a surviving branch Davidian, and we're taking your calls and this hit me like what? There's even a Branch Davidian alive and they have a point of view and you can hear it. And he's live right now and he's talking and people can call in and they can what? Because in my world that I lived in, what you know about the branch of ID Indians is what you read in the Austin America Statesman or what you're told by Ted Koppel and Dan Rather. And that's all you get.\n\nWhat do you mean? Yeah, I can interact with one. Yeah. And then the callers are brilliant. The callers know all, they're not kooks. They know exactly what they're talking about. And they'll be like, I'll tell you what happened was on March the 19th, blah, blah, blah. Oh, okay. So this is why I'm like, this is, this is Talk radio to me is, it's like if you believe in the idea of like any kind of like so-called popular government, like if we have to settle for any sort of stateism at all, you want the people to be able to have one big ass conversation with each other. Right. That's why your show is so important because you get hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of thousands of views and listens, maybe millions if you include all the podcasts.\n\nAnd so for a guy like me, it's like, yeah, it's a chance to talk to a whole bunch of people to get a bunch of people having the same conversation together instead of everybody just all spread out having their own little separate arguments and not interacting with each other. So to me that was the brilliance of talk radio and then where Rush Limbaugh and g Gordon Liddy were all polished and had their little programs. The guys on 5:50 AM in San Antonio, especially Carl Wigglesworth was my favorite. But him and all those guys, even Ricky Ware, who was the John Hae lunatic, but he was still such a sweet guy. And their talk radio, their version of talk radio was,\n\nAll right, call Woolsworth show. Everybody we're talking about Bill Clinton selling cocaine down there with Dan Lasseter and mean Arkansas. And we got Terry Reed on the phone. Tell us about your book Compromise Clinton Bush and the CIA Terry.\n\nBut everybody's kicking back. Yeah. Everybody's got this front porch that's all attitude. And they got all the time in the world. We're here every day for three hours a day, no thing. And we're talking about, and and they're just the nicest guys. Come back from commercial and go, it's Carl, we're talking with Terry about the thing. And no bumper music, no fanfare, no last name. You just jumped, jumped in the middle of a conversation, tune in, figure it out. And it's just beautiful. It's perfect. And then I modeled myself and the way I do my show on beginning on Free Radio Austin in 98 and 99, and then on Chaos Radio, Austin from 2002 through 2010. I guess I was on chaos, although it wasn't, yeah, it was 2010 before they seized our last transmitter from chaos, wasn't it?\n\nI think it was. So yeah, it dropped over 10 years. I did chaos for like yeah. A long time. And then, so that was my whole attitude was, look, I am a regular guy. I ain't gotta fake that. I didn't Go to college, I dropped that at a CC and my message ain't for elite policy makers. My message is for my peers. Look at what they're doing. That's it. And, and this is why the, you know, the Roth Bardy style of libertarian populism really always appealed to me is because that's who it's geared toward. The Cato Institute wants an audience with the Senate, the Mees Institute and the Libertarian Institute, an anti-war dot com. We want an audience with the population of this country, right? That's who we're trying to talk to. That's who we are.\n\nThat's where we come from. We're not Washington DC folk. We're from out here and are, we're speaking in the third person about them, you know, rather trying to be part of the regime.\n\nI I just wanna say briefly that the, you said the people that call in are usually brilliant. And that's the experience I've had. I've recorded a few conversations just on the street. Like I went to the West Bank and I interviewed a bunch of people on the street and I really wanna do that a lot more because I didn't meet a single person who's not brilliant in their own way. Yeah. It's like, it's remarkable. It's remarkable to brilliance that comes from people You ever listen\n\nTo sports radio?\n\nNot, not as much as I probably should.\n\nYeah. Well look, you know what, well, I don't know if this counts anymore, but I spent a little bit of time in Denver, listen to sports radio in Denver. Nice. These people are fanatics, man. But the point being that, you know, Jimmy, the air conditioner repairman is smarter than you dude. Yeah. And he knows everything that every baseball team ever achieved and win. And who and everyone on the teams, all their stats. All their everything and why it mattered and it mattered a lot to them. And the level of expertise there is no different than in your highest applied sciences or history or any other thing. Exactly. You know what I mean? It all just depends on what you're interested in and what you want to know that much about.\n\nAnd this is norm Chomsky's thing that he talked about where, look, if you're a primate that's intelligent enough to speak, then you are a genius. Right? Then you are absolute miracle, unbelievable impossible. You know, circumstance, situation of your very existence. And so we all ought to be taken like at that very level, you know what I mean? Like no matter who you're dealing with there's something special in there, you know?\n\nYeah. And usually it comes with humility because people with PhDs and Harvard and so on, they usually have this overinflated ego that comes from authority, but sports, radio, people on the street everyday, folks. Yeah. They don't have that. And so they could just speak their expertise without the ego.\n\nYeah. Well, and, and that's my thing too, is I don't have nothing to sell yet other than, I mean my coffee sponsor and whatever, but like my, my sincerity is like all I got, I don't have any other argument from authority that I can invoke other than people listen to me. They know I'm not lying and they can tell what my biases are. I wear 'em absolutely on my sleeve. You know what I mean? Is every day I only try to quantify whether I hate Bill Clinton or George W. Bush Moore. And it's, and that's where I'm coming from. And everybody understands that and they know that I never deliberately try to make 'em think one thing instead of another. And if I did, they would obviously catch on to that and then I'd be completely ruined and have to just go get a job delivered auto parts or something.\n\nAnd which would be fine. In fact, I like delivering auto parts. I've had that job before. Although I'd rather drive at night if I gotta drive. I'd rather, I guess drive a Uber at night. But\n\nIf you still have energy,\n\nOh, I'm not even halfway done. What about you? All right.\n\nGot all the energy in the world. Let's maybe a quick bathroom break. Yeah.\n\nA good place to pick up our story here would be John Muir Heimer and Stephen Watt's book. We've talked about Muir Heimer and Walt previously. Now their book is called The Israel Lobby and American-Born Policy. It came out in 2007. It started out as a essay that they wrote first for the Atlantic Month late that commission the story and then refused to run it. And they ended up running it in the London review of books. We also ran it anti-war dot com. People can find it there. It's called the Israel Lobby in American Foreign Policy. It's a fantastic article. And then they made it into a book. And now these guys are, again, the co deans, basically of the Realist School of Foreign Policy. One from the University of Chicago, the other from Harvard.\n\nBoth highly respected, neither of them haters or ideologues or any of these things, they were ruthlessly attacked as antisemites for this, which is completely preposterous. And what they did though was say that, look, man, Israel's interests are very different than ours. And that's why they spend so much money and effort lobbying in the United States to try to obfuscate that fact that what's good for them ain't necessarily good for us at all. Well, they have to make sure it's at least good for the people in charge here, if not for the country itself. And that's their object. And as Walton Heimer say in the essay and in the book that you can't blame the whole Iraq War on them.\n\nGeorge W. Bush was the one sitting in the chair behind that desk calling that shot. He could have changed his mind at the very last moment. It was on him and now is the Congress's responsibility. But they passed that responsibility to him with their unconstitutional authorization that they passed in October of 2002. But like ultimately, who pulled that trigger? George W. Bush did. And in conspiracy with his vice president and his Secretary of Defense and the rest of them. So the neocons, yes, they were the Deputy Secretary of Defense and the Deputy Secretary of Defense for policy. And the, you know, staff in the Vice President's office, the staff of the National Security Council, they were there operating really, as I said, as that, as Colin Powell called it, that separate government and operating mostly for Benjamin Netanyahu's goals.\n\nAnd this is part of what we argued about me and Mark Dubowitz on your show last time was he insisted somewhat, partially, correctly here, that Ariel Sharon wanted Bush to hit Iran, not Iraq. And Ariel Sharon, not Netanyahu was the prime minister.",

      "transcript_chunk": "Do you find it strange at all that so many people still love candles? I mean, ever since we got electricity, candles have been non-essential. Let's call them right, an obsolete technology, but they have not disappeared. Every generation seems to rediscover them. Why do you think that is?\n\nYeah, it's a very interesting question. It's interesting to think about how the job that candles do has changed over time. You could go back 5,000 years to the first things that were like candles, and I would describe it as portable fire. It's portable fire that lets you find your way or lets you do work when it's dark.\n\nThis might be a little clay lamp with oil in it and a wick or something.\n\nThe earliest records that we know about would be in ancient Egypt. A pithy reed just dipped in some animal fat.\n\nI\n\nSee. But we see wicked candles maybe 3000 years ago. A lot of records that the Romans were using them. It's WIC and wax and it's essentially what we still have today, especially in the last 50 years. The job is no longer utilitarian. It might be decor or even if it is about light, it's about setting a mood and then the other jobs of home fragrancing or self-care indulgence. I think all those things together with that primal light experience is just something that really speaks to a lot of people. I personally feel sort of drawn to the light like I'm a primitive bug.\n\nThat was Stevec. He's president of the National Candle Association. The candle industry does about $10 billion a year in global sales, and that number has been rising fast. A lot of this increase is driven by scented candles, but there are also tapers pillars, tea lights, votives, and more. I don't know about you, but to me this candle boom is somewhat surprising and slightly weird. The vast majority of the world has access to electricity and one of the many advantages of electricity is that it eliminates the need for a live flame in your house, a flame that can burn down your house, and yet for some reason, we still want that portable fire in our homes.\n\nWhy? One theory involves a word that is spelled H-Y-G-G-E.\n\nIt's pronounced Hoge.\n\nThat's Mike Viking. He's a Danish happiness researcher. You probably know that Denmark is on average a very happy place.\n\nI think the best explanation of what Hoge is is the art of creating a nice atmosphere. It's about togetherness, it's about pleasure, it's about warmth, it's about relaxation, and that is a key cornerstone of Danish culture. Danes HOA is what freedom perhaps is to the Americans,\n\nBut Americans these days also seem to want their cougar. Around half of those 10 billion global candle dollars are spent in the us. So today on Freakonomics Radio, Why Do Candles Still Exist? What other nostalgic technologies do we clinging to? What role does planned obsolescence play in all of this, and why do we stuff our closets full of antiquated things.\n\nIt almost is like a process of psychoanalysis.\n\nThis is Freakonomics Radio, the podcast that explores the hidden side of everything with your host Steven Dubner.\n\nWhat is the most unusual candle scent you've ever encountered?\n\nI've seen a lot of things like bacon and beer. Some of those are just, you know, interesting but not appealing to me.\n\nThat again is Steve Hark of the National Candle Association or NCA.\n\nThe NCA was founded in 1974. We act as the collective voice of the candle industry. Whenever that's needed, we promote candle safety. We are an authority on candle manufacturing and science. We support scientific research into candles.\n\nWhen our daughter was younger, my wife and I forbade her from burning candles in her bedroom. 'cause a couple times she almost burned down the house. Isn't it just a little bit strange that we are all allowed and even encouraged to use open flames in our homes?\n\nYeah, so there is a responsibility of the user to use the candle safely. So if I can, I want to tell you the big three and make sure that all the listeners are aware of 'em. Please. First of all, when you burn a candle, always keep it within sight. Number two, keep it away from anything that can catch fire. That especially means betting, but also things like curtains. And number three, keep them away from children and pets. If you do those three things, then the chances of starting a candle fire in your home are greatly reduced,\n\nBut not everyone is so careful. According to the nonprofit National Fire Protection Agency, candles are responsible for about 6,000 home fires a year in the us, resulting in an average of 74 civilian deaths and a quarter of a billion dollars in property damage. By the way, serving as president of the National Candle Association is not Steve EK's only job. In fact, the reason he has that job is because of his other job.\n\nYeah. My main job is that I'm a research fellow at Procter and Gamble. I work in research and development focused mainly on our aircare business. So brands like Fabric.\n\nSteve, what does it mean to be a research fellow at p and g?\n\nThe full title is Senior Director Research Fellow. What it means is that I am in charge of research programs to improve our products and develop new products unlike an academic where the end goal is just the pursuit of knowledge, our end goal is to make money to make superior products and create superior experiences for people.\n\nEnsc has degrees from Michigan Tech and Georgia Tech in chemical engineering and in pulp and paper science respectively. He has worked at Procter and Gamble for more than 20 years. P and g is one of the biggest consumer goods companies in the world. They make tide laundry detergent, Pampers diapers, Gillette razors, and many other brands. You know, their headquarters are in Cincinnati where the company was founded in the 1830s as a maker of soap and candles. James Gamble was an Irish born soap maker. William Proctor was an English born candle maker. This was a good time to be a candle maker.\n\nYou see the development of automated candle production and molded candles and things like that in 1830 or so, and then you have the discovery of paraffin wax, about 1850 paraffin wax is the solid component of crude oil, and then in 1880 or so, the electric light bulb comes right, and there was a little bit of a decline. Once we get into the 20th century, the materials that make candles became a lot more widely available as they were byproducts of that increased demand for oil and stare in from increased meat packing activity and candles became a little bit more popular again, but they're sold more for ceremonies, for traditions like birthdays, novelty candles for holidays.\n\nThe market stayed pretty steady until the late seventies and early 1980s. That's when you started seeing the shift in the job of candles to more home decor and ambiance in the introduction of scented candles that necessitated some innovation as there really wasn't enough paraffin wax to make up that demand. So you see the invention of vegetable waxes from soy and from palm.\n\nWhen I think about the boom incented candles, I'm wondering if you were involved in the controversy over Yankee candles during COVID. Could you walk us through that?\n\nI am sorry. I really don't know very much about that.\n\nAre you aware of it though? People were writing reviews on Amazon and other places saying that their candles that they were buying from the Yankee candle company were defective because they were unscented when they were supposed to be scented. But what it turns out was a lot of people who had gotten COVID had lost their sense of smell.\n\nNow that you say it, I think I do remember something about that. One of the things that I study and am curious about is just the sense of olfaction in general. It's really one of the least understood senses from a biological standpoint. Like all the mechanisms that are involved in actually smelling, it's in my opinion, been a little bit overlooked in the medical community, but it is a big, big hit on your quality of life.\n\nI have a slightly different take on that because two members of my immediate family have not had a sense of smell. One was born without, which is apparently not, you know, wildly rare and one lost it later. Wow. I mean, yes, my first reaction was like yours, like it's a great loss. On the other hand, you know, we live in New York City and there are a lot of days when I kind of wish I couldn't smell, but that got me to wondering on the flip side, because I know that you as a scientist have done a lot of research on odors. Can you talk about how the world smells on average today compared to the past? I would assume we are in a relatively wonderful smelling era.\n\nWe certainly have a lot of products to keep things smelling better, but overall in terms of how the world smells, I think it actually smells worse. You do, it really has to do with just a lot of crowding. You think about a lot of small apartments and your neighbors cooking and you're in there with your pet in a small space. But yeah, certainly candles and a lot of other air care products are there to help us with that problem.\n\nI'm going to interrupt here to say that while I like and trust Steve Rezac, I'm not sure. I believe that the world smells worse today than it used to. Of course, it depends where you were and when, but think about how many seriously stinky things. There used to be raw sewage dumped into rivers, horse manure piled up on city streets, factories and refineries, spitting smoke and ash into the air. Then there's body odor, bad breath, I could go on, but you get the idea. So I would think that the present on average smells better than the past, but I do appreciate Renzi X's point about our olfactory system being underappreciated and important.\n\nJust as a bad smell can ruin your day, a good one can elevate it. Which gets us back to the candle craze. Yankee candle, one of the biggest candle makers in the US has more than 600 fragrances. Their candles typically sell for 30 to $40, which puts them in the mid price range. You can spend much more than that at Diptic or Joe Malone. Trader Joe's meanwhile sells candles for about $4. Some of their recent fragrances are grapefruit and peach black tea.\n\nOur industry is pretty accessible in that almost anyone can start a candle company without a lot of barriers to entry, a lot of big capital needs. As a result, our industry is pretty vibrant and pretty inclusive. Lots of companies are selling candles. We think that there are about 10,000 different fragrances that you can get in a candle. Can\n\nYou just gimme a few of your favorites over the years or maybe most memorable?\n\nFor me personally, it really depends on what I'm doing. If it's the holidays, then maybe I want to get into a holiday mood. Sometimes it can be pine like trying to say like, you know, I'm out cutting down a Christmas tree. Or you know, maybe it's more of a baking vanilla kind of scent.\n\nHow do you feel about cranberry?\n\nOh, I personally don't really like cranberry scents. How\n\nDo you feel about eucalyptus?\n\nI do like eucalyptus. That is a scent that actually has some cooling properties, sort of like menthol and it gives you that fresh air feel.\n\nSome candle makers enlist social media influencers to promote their products. Here is Sir Candleman who between Instagram and TikTok has more than 400,000 followers.\n\nNest has some gorgeous new candles, but are they good? They sent me one, so let's try it and rate it. It's Sahar, OOD and num. Ooh. So you know what I say. A good candle has three things, scent, style and strength. That smells good y'all.\n\nThat good smelling candle from Nest New York costs $195 plus shipping. If you go to a friend's housewarming party and give them a candle like that, you are making a statement. Here's Steve Herk again.\n\nThey come at all price points. You can find scented candles in the five to $10 range all the way up to a hundred dollars or more.\n\nI have seen those a hundred dollars and more candles and I'm just curious how that market came about. I think a lot of consumers are pretty savvy about how much it costs to manufacture something versus how much it sells for, but I think many consumers are also savvy about, well, once something becomes a kind of object that is beautiful. I understand that that drives prices up. Was that high end of the candle market created by a particular entrepreneur or company? Did it come about more grassroots in that? Tell me what you can.\n\nI would say it mirrors some other industries where you're seeing consumers want more exclusivity, more unique things, and that's part of what drives prices higher. If you think about a candle on the lower end of the market, you're probably talking about something which is more mass produced using modern manufacturing methods with automation maybe uses more common fragrance ingredients. Whereas on the upper end you're talking about more custom made, custom fragrances, fragrances that maybe are in touch with the latest fragrance trends today maybe that are associated with luxury brands or celebrity spokespeople and those kind of things.\n\nThere is one inescapable and slightly uncomfortable fact about a candle. The more you use it, the faster you lose it.\n\nTo understand product lifetimes, you have to understand the reasons why people buy products.\n\nThat is Tim Cooper from Nottingham Trent University in the north of England. He is an emeritus professor of sustainable design and consumption. With a background in economics, Cooper has found that more and more people, producers, and consumers are thinking about the lifespan of products.\n\nA lot of the interest has come from the electronic sector, not least because that's an area where products have been criticized by many consumers for not lasting long enough, but also an area where there's a natural tendency for products to change over time as technology advance is. There's also been interest from the clothing sector because clothing technically is what they call a semi durable product. They can last for a long period of time, but obviously in the fashion sector, clothing doesn't last very long. There's also been interest in other areas as well. Car industry, for example, furniture\n\nAnd how does Tim Cooper think about the candle industry?\n\nWe rarely need a candle for light, but there's a large industry in the use of candles for decorative purposes. And this raises interesting questions. To what extent are products merely functional or in the case of candles functioning as they used to in the past? Or are there other reasons why people buy products? In the case of candles, they don't need them for life. They need them for emotional satisfaction. That explains why we buy so much stuff. It's not just because we have to have it or we won't survive. It's because we want to have it, 'cause it's doing different things for us.\n\nWhat are those different things for that, I think we may need an anthropologist.\n\nWhenever the weather gets cold, I feel like I have to buy more candles.\n\nIt's coming up after the break.

      "transcript_chunk": "Have you ever found yourself agitated or confounded or just sick of the current state of affairs and wondered What It might be like to live in another time?\n\nI do not belong to this time period. I know it sounds crazy, but when I wore armor and I'm sitting in front of a castle in Germany or in Poland, I felt like I belonged there. You know, I I I feel at home\n\nFor some people. Home is in the Middle Ages.\n\nIt appears to be a simpler time. People worked hard and played hard. It seems exotic to us. Now\n\nThe exotic place these people are in is New Jersey at the Burlington County Fairgrounds. It's a warm sticky Sunday in June and they are attending the annual New Jersey Renaissance Fair, fair with an E at the end. Despite the heat, they're wearing woolen vests and long sleeved dresses, heavy boots also among the men, a lot of very bushy beards. Matt Schwarz is one of the musical performers. He is a harpist.\n\nI think nowadays you look at a world that doesn't have a lot of our modern problems and you think it was perfect. Of course back then they had their own problems. But I think there's much to be said with a world in which you're in touch with, with the outdoors in nature.\n\nJordan Cavalier is another musical performer.\n\nThis is called the Nickel Harpa. It's a Swedish key fiddle. It's 16 strings of medial Swedish glory. It has three melody strings, one drone string, and 12 sympathetic strings. I started playing six years ago and now I'm here refa playing it. This is like my life. Now,\n\nIn the US alone there are a couple hundred Renaissance fairs. Each year they give you a chance to hear period music, eat a Turkey leg or a giant pickle and pretend that you are not only in a different time, but that you are a different person.\n\nI am so Magan the Night of Fortitude, part of the night of Virtue, soon to fight in the Tournament of Virtue here at one 30 on the field.\n\nOkay, so there's two nights on like different horses on opposing sides and they're, they have like their jousting stick and they're trying to get the rings, so whichever one gets the rings, they get the point.\n\nAnother night Paul Mahaffey emerges from his jousting tournament, sweaty and winded.\n\nIt's almost been a year since I armored up and I love it. There's, it was exhausting, but I could do it again. In 10 minutes, the adrenaline gets going and you just get in there. It's just you and him. That's all you see. 'cause you can't see anything else in the helmet and it's great.\n\nOkay, so that's what they're all doing here. What are we doing here? When we set out to make a three part series about the arc of human life, we knew we would begin with birth and child rearing. That was last week's episode. You can catch up later if you missed it. We also knew that the final episode would be about aging and death, but what about the middle episode? We thought it would be interesting to explore what it's like to be middle Aged, but then you realize that our current concept of middle Aged is very new. At the beginning of the 20th century, average life expectancy was only 31 years old. Now that number on its own is misleading. There were plenty of old people and middle Aged people too, but the average was brought down by the incredibly high rate of child mortality.\n\nSo we got to wondering what was it like to be middle Aged back in the Middle Ages? And we asked the Renaissance fair attendees a simple question. If you could go back, would you go back?\n\nI'd rather be middle Aged in pretty much any century in the Middle Ages. That was rough, rough time.\n\nI would've not survived anything. No, I need like a Marriott, but I need like a JW Marriott. I don't even survive this when it rains.\n\nSo we have this thing today called ibuprofen that is a very, very powerful help to being middle Aged.\n\nSo that's how the Fairgoers feel today on Freakonomics Radio, we get an expert view on What It was like to be middle Aged in the Middle Ages. Ibuprofen not\n\nIncluded.\n\nThis is Freakonomics Radio, the podcast that explores the hidden side of everything with your host Steven Dubner.\n\nThe Middle Ages as agreed upon by most historians, cover the years from roughly 500 to 1500. Most historians also agree that renaissance fairs are not entirely accurate, so we decided to speak with a couple of actual historians.\n\nMy name is Nele Hja and I teach medieval history at Columbia University.\n\nHow would you describe generally your research interests?\n\nMy research interests are mostly in religious history of the Middle Ages, specifically history of Christianity. But because religion is so pervasive in the medieval world, basically every other type of history falls into the religious history that is social history, political history and everything. So I basically study everything.\n\nHow did you come to this particular concentration?\n\nMy story is a little bit unusual really, because I actually graduated from college as an industrial engineer. Oh,\n\nSorry. Yeah, that's a change.\n\nThat is a change. But then in the last year of engineering, I had read Umberto Echo's name of the Rose, and there I met for the first time the Franciscan order. What is special about Franciscan order is that they really wanted to be poor, very, very poor, poorer than everybody else. And I thought, who on earth might like to be poor? That seemed to me so strange, such a great contrast to modern life when everybody wants to be rich. I was very fascinated from the beginning with the monks and friars life now. I see a lot of problems in that kind of life that I didn't see before.\n\nFor instance,\n\nFor instance, no matter how hard they try, their passions and moral issues do not leave them. We think that the monks are calm and peaceful, dedicating their lives to God. But when you read the sources, it's not like that. They are very much acting. They\n\nCould be angry and horny.\n\nExactly. And corrupt and greedy.\n\nOkay, so that's Nestle shek, our first scholar of the Middle Ages. Let's meet the other one.\n\nMy name's Philip Schofield. I am a medieval historian at Abes with,\n\nThat's a university in Wales.\n\nMy main interests are in the broad air of economic history and I work particularly on peasantry.\n\nWhat would you say drew you to the study of peasantry?\n\nAs an undergraduate, I was really intrigued by the broad socioeconomic history that medievals, especially in France were doing, looking at the social structure of medieval villages.\n\nWhen I read about the work of archeologists and others who find physical evidence or ruins, it always seems a bit miraculous that things have survived from so long ago and yet it does happen. When you study economic history, I'm curious what the evidence is like and if it feels as though you're always reaching through a veil of sorts. Never quite getting to the reality.\n\nThat's always the sense. On one level, when I was doing my doctorate, I wrote at one stage something like, he probably thought that, and my supervisor, someone called Barbara Harvey, she said, what are you doing? You don't probably think it. You either know it or you don't know it, and if you don't know it, leave it out. That's sort of old school, but I it, it appeals to me really. I imagine if I walked through a 14th century peasant village on the basis of my understanding from 14th century records, there's undoubtedly a lot of things that would surprise me. But there are local court records, manorial records that are really the records generated by Lords, but include a huge amount of incidental information directed at the peasantry, including, for example, litigation.\n\nThat's something I work on quite a bit, is actually peasants not litigating with their lords, but peasants litigating with each other.\n\nI asked Philip Schofield if he was willing to imagine the daily life of a middle Aged peasant from that era, maybe a composite figure based on bits and pieces of schofield's research. He was actually able to do us one better than that.\n\nI did write something almost 30 years ago now in a journal called Past and Present about two peasants who litigated. So they're both real people and because they were extremely enthusiastic litigants, they tended to be more evident. And because they were relatively wealthy, they were also more evident and they also exist in taxation data. So that's the kind of person I would maybe go to.\n\nExcellent. Of these two peasant litigants, I need you to pick one that you can describe for us. Who would you prefer?\n\nI will pick someone called Robert, the son of Adam.\n\nOkay. Robert, the son of Adam. Where does he live?\n\nHe lived in a place called Hindu Clay in Suffolk.\n\nAnd what year would you like to place Robert, the son of Adam in Hindu clay. That would count as his middle age,\n\nLet's say about 1305. I hope he's not dead by then. He was certainly active around that time and was doing pretty well.\n\nHow old is he?\n\nI would say he was probably in his thirties.\n\nAnd that counts as middle Aged then?\n\nI think so, yeah. I was thinking about this today and what I know about calculations of life expectancy, most of that is really hard to do from the records I've describing, but it's really monastic evidence from the 15th century where you've got a whole range of moments in amongst life in places like Westminster Abbey and Durham, cathedral, priory and so on. And then you can follow them through various administrative tasks and then often they end up in the infirmary and their desks are recorded. The estimates for that tend to suggest that life expectancy is taking people into the late forties. 50.\n\nOkay. We will return later to Robert, son of Adam, a relatively wealthy peasant in hinder Clay, England. I asked Nestle Shaza who grew up in Turkey, what it's like to really immerse yourself in medieval history.\n\nIt gives you perspective, it gives you an alternative. It takes you out of the bubble, which is modern life. When we grow up, we are born into this life. We sometimes think that this is the only way things could be, but it could have been another way.\n\nSo if I asked you to switch places with someone from that period, would you be would willing or interested?\n\nIf I'm going to have my kids with me, yes. If certain conditions are met, I guess I would, yeah. 'cause it's a much simpler life. I'd like to be an artisan in a city, I guess. Mm.\n\nWhat would you make?\n\nStained glass would be nice. I mean, stained glass is so beautiful. People in the Middle Ages had their shops actually inside their homes, so I don't have to even go somewhere else.\n\nWhere exactly would you choose to live?\n\nLet's make it Italy.\n\nIn a city or rural?\n\nIt has to be a city, really. Italian cities were much more advanced in the 13th century. Much better organized. You have free healthcare, free education. If I'm rural than I would have to be peasant.\n\nAnd you want to be an artisan? Yes,\n\nI'd rather be an artisan. I think being a peasant requires far too much energy, which I don't think I have.\n\nLet's start with the city. Where will you live?\n\nWell, I quite like Florence, so it would have to be Florence.\n\nWhat year shall we pick? 12?\n\nFifties would be good\n\nIn real life today. Do you have a spouse or partner?\n\nI do have a spouse, yes. And he's Italian actually.\n\nSo Nestle shek has raised the stakes by including herself in our exercise and she's bringing along her husband and two sons. I asked Philip Scofield what we know about the family of Robert, the son of Adam.\n\nHe's got a brother. Beyond that, it's difficult to be entirely sure. We do know from other contemporaries that if he was fairly typical, he would have a wife and maybe a small number of surviving children, some of whom would survive into adulthood. So it's quite reasonable to suppose that he had three or four children who moved beyond infancy.\n\nWhat do his children do? At what age do they start to perhaps work with him? Well,\n\nThey were still really young, you know, less than 10. So small scale herding, managing crops, keeping birds off things, helping with harvest and so on.\n\nWhat level of education would these kids be getting?\n\nEducation is fairly limited. A lot of education is the education of the village in a sense of learning from doing in some ways. What\n\nDoes Robert eat and drink?\n\nThe bulk of his diet would've been predominantly grain-based, but leavened by fish, both sea fish and fresh water. Fish, maybe a little bit of meat, probably bacon, but also poultry. Quite a lot of ale in his diet.\n\nIs there a relatively low alcohol version of ale that children and others would drink since it was safer than water? I mean\n\nChildren are drinking ale, definitely. Whether it's low alcohol or not, it's difficult to be entirely sure.\n\nObviously in Florence you would have access to very good wine. What\n\nWould a family dinner look like?\n\nIt would definitely have vegetables and fruit. Meat is a little bit more problematic for medieval people 'cause it's expensive. Pork and chicken would be cheaper than beef, so we might have that maybe once a week. People did consume a lot of beans and lentils and things like that. Also because they were durable, they don't go bad. We wouldn't obviously have any fridge or anything, not even a cellar. But also, of course the main staple of any diet is the bread.\n\nSay a bit more about why you are determined to put yourself in a city and not a village or the countryside.\n\nThe big difference is that you are much less exposed to the elements. City life is pretty safe compared to the rural life because the cities are walled. They're very well protected in the countryside. You do get raid, you might have animals coming in, wild animals, which were much more in number in the Middle Ages than they are now. Obviously they've been hunted down over the years. There is food insecurity in the countryside. I wouldn't have food insecurity because generally what the medieval cities like Florence did, they had big granaries. They stored grain just in case there's famine and then they would distribute it to the citizens.\n\nLet's talk about the state of commerce. How does that work? How much do you make and what are you able to buy with it?\n\nI would have to find commissioned jobs. If I'm a stain glass maker, that would mean either a church or a monastery would have to gimme orders. There are lots of churches, many more than now. And if a church can afford having stained glass, which would be expensive, I think I can make decent amount of money to be what corresponds today to middle class.\n\nOkay, so you're a middle class, middle Aged artisan in the Middle Ages. Yes.\n\nThat's a lot of middle.\n\nThat's okay. That's why we're here. What is it like to be a freelance artisan then?\n\nWell, the thing is I would have to enter the guilt of stained glass makers. All the trades were very well organized. Today's trade unions, they really have their origins in the Middle Ages, so I would have to pay dues to my gu. I would have to be registered as a master of state class, and the amount of money I can charge would be regulated by them.\n\nWhen you read economic history, the economists are usually anti guild because they see guilds as monopolistic within their domain. There was actually this famous economic essay about how the Candlemakers guild were trying to have a resolution passed that forbade the sun from shining at certain times because with too much sunlight there was less demand for their products plainly. That was not quite real, but the sentiment I think was legitimate. I'm curious, how would you feel about your guild? Would you feel it's generally a positive for you and for the rest of society, positive for you and a negative for the others, and maybe even negative for you because you have to join this guild and pay dues and have your wages probably set as opposed to being a true freelancer?\n\nWell, I'm not inflicted with the aire ideas of the modern economy, which I consider a good thing. The guild is a very good thing for the people inside it.",

        "So that's what they're all doing here. What are we doing here? When we set out to make a three part series about the arc of human life, we knew we would begin with birth and child rearing. That was last week's episode. You can catch up later if you missed it. We also knew that the final episode would be about aging and death, but what about the middle episode? We thought it would be interesting to explore what it's like to be middle aged, but then you realize that our current concept of middle aged is very new. At the beginning of the 20th century, average life expectancy was only 31 years old.",
        "There were plenty of old people and middle aged people too, but the average was brought down by the incredibly high rate of child mortality.",
        "So we got to wondering what was it like to be middle aged back in the Middle Ages? And we asked the Renaissance fair attendees a simple question. If you could go back, would you go back?",
        "I'd rather be middle aged in pretty much any century in the Middle Ages. That was rough, rough time.",
        "I would've not survived anything. No, I need like a Marriott, but I need like a JW Marriott. I don't even survive this when it rains.",
        "So we have this thing today called ibuprofen that is a very, very powerful help to being middle aged.",
        "My name is Nele Hja and I teach medieval history at Columbia University.",
        "How would you describe generally your research interests? My research interests are mostly in religious history of the Middle Ages, specifically history of Christianity. But because religion is so pervasive in the medieval world, basically every other type of history falls into the religious history that is social history, political history and everything. So I basically study everything.",
        "How did you come to this particular concentration? My story is a little bit unusual really, because I actually graduated from college as an industrial engineer. Oh, that is a change. But then in the last year of engineering, I had read Umberto Echo's name of the Rose, and there I met for the first time the Franciscan order. What is special about Franciscan order is that they really wanted to be poor, very, very poor, poorer than everybody else. And I thought, who on earth might like to be poor? That seemed to me so strange, such a great contrast to modern life when everybody wants to be rich. I was very fascinated from the beginning with the monks and friars life now. I see a lot of problems in that kind of life that I didn't see before.",
        "For instance, no matter how hard they try, their passions and moral issues do not leave them. We think that the monks are calm and peaceful, dedicating their lives to God. But when you read the sources, it's not like that. They are very much acting. They could be angry and horny. Exactly. And corrupt and greedy.",
        "My name's Philip Schofield. I am a medieval historian at Abes with, that's a university in Wales.",
        "My main interests are in the broad air of economic history and I work particularly on peasantry.",
        "What would you say drew you to the study of peasantry? As an undergraduate, I was really intrigued by the broad socioeconomic history that medievals, especially in France were doing, looking at the social structure of medieval villages.",
        "When I read about the work of archeologists and others who find physical evidence or ruins, it always seems a bit miraculous that things have survived from so long ago and yet it does happen. When you study economic history, I'm curious what the evidence is like and if it feels as though you're always reaching through a veil of sorts. Never quite getting to the reality.",
        "That's always the sense. On one level, when I was doing my doctorate, I wrote at one stage something like, he probably thought that, and my supervisor, someone called Barbara Harvey, she said, what are you doing? You don't probably think it. You either know it or you don't know it, and if you don't know it, leave it out. That's sort of old school, but I it, it appeals to me really. I imagine if I walked through a 14th century peasant village on the basis of my understanding from 14th century records, there's undoubtedly a lot of things that would surprise me. But there are local court records, manorial records that are really the records generated by Lords, but include a huge amount of incidental information directed at the peasantry, including, for example, litigation.",
        "That's something I work on quite a bit, is actually peasants not litigating with their lords, but peasants litigating with each other.",
        "I asked Philip Schofield if he was willing to imagine the daily life of a middle aged peasant from that era, maybe a composite figure based on bits and pieces of Schofield's research. He was actually able to do us one better than that.",
        "I did write something almost 30 years ago now in a journal called Past and Present about two peasants who litigated. So they're both real people and because they were extremely enthusiastic litigants, they tended to be more evident. And because they were relatively wealthy, they were also more evident and they also exist in taxation data. So that's the kind of person I would maybe go to.",
        "Excellent. Of these two peasant litigants, I need you to pick one that you can describe for us. Who would you prefer? I will pick someone called Robert, the son of Adam.",
        "Okay. Robert, the son of Adam. Where does he live? He lived in a place called Hindu Clay in Suffolk.",
        "And what year would you like to place Robert, the son of Adam in Hindu Clay. That would count as his middle age? Let's say about 1305. I hope he's not dead by then. He was certainly active around that time and was doing pretty well.",
        "How old is he? I would say he was probably in his thirties."

      "transcript_chunk": "out, go out and read diversion of nuclear material IAEA reports dating back at least 20 years and you'll see the IA meticulously, methodically dispassionately outlining all of the violations that Iran has embarked on of the NPT. Virtually\n\nAll those are resolved later. They won't answer this, and then later they do, they won't answer that. And then later they do.\n\nAnd many open files are still a still there. I mean, just again, like I just, I just want your viewers to walk away from this conversation thing. Okay. That's interesting. I I I didn't know that and that I'm gonna go fact check mark and fact check Scott and just kind of see what this is all about, right? Because otherwise it's just he says, she says, or he says, he says, the fact of the matter is, is that Iran has been in violations of its obligations under the NPT under the additional protocol. It never, it never, it never ratified under its safeguards, obligations under the NPT. It suggests a pattern of nuclear mendacity. They\n\nAbided by the additional protocol without having ratified it. They abide by it for three years and did not proceed with any enrichment at all as long as they were dealing in good faith with the EU until W Bush ruined those negotiations and closed them down, only then did they begin to install the centrifuges at Naans. It's\n\nAlways the Americans you complained screw things up, you\n\nComplained. They didn't ratify the thing, but they abided by it for years. So,\n\nSo that's an interesting\n\nDisagreement. They were violation of it. But\n\nI, I think a more pragmatic and important disagreement that we already spoke to is how do we decrease the incentive for Iran to build nuclear programs, not just the next couple years, but the next 10, 20 years that's you're mocking that. There's a lot of people that will, there's neocons that say basically invade everything, let's make money off of war. But there's people that will say that, you know, Operation Midnight Hammer is actually a focused hard demonstration of strength, a piece of strength that is an effective way to do geopolitics. I mean, there's cases to be made for all of it if\n\nWe're really lucky.\n\nYeah. So it's a big risk is your case. So\n\nHere's some practical recommendations that I think the United States should follow. I think the first is, you know, get the Iranians back to Oman, negotiate with them and do a deal. Again, the deal has to be no enrichment full dismantlement. I I, I think for the reasons we talked about today, Scott and I passionately disagreed. But that's fine. We, this is, this is a reasonable debate. Neither of us is crazy, neither of us is rational. It is, what would it take to get a deal with Iran? I say, I say this is the deal. This has to be our red line. Scott disagrees, that's fine, but we gotta get a deal in that deal. We gotta provide them financial incentives, right? We're gonna have to lift a certain number of sanctions because they, they're gonna have to get something in return, right? We can argue about exactly how much, but I think our opening negotiating position is no sanctions relief.\n\nAnd then we'll get negotiated down from that, right? I mean, like, I think a lot of this is about how do you position yourself for a negotiation? How do you, how do you come in with leverage and then how do you find areas of compromise where you, you satisfy your objectives? One is Oman, two is the credible threat of military force needs to remain, right? Hamnet needs to understand that the United States of America and Israel will use military force to stop him from developing Nuclear Weapons if he didn't believe that before 12 days ago. He now believes that. And I think that's the credibility of that military force has to be maintained in order to ensure that he does not break out or sneak out to a Nuclear weapons.\n\nI, I think that's absolutely critical. Third is, I think we have to reach agreements with all the other countries in the Middle East to say, Hey listen, we're demanding zero enrichment and full dismantlement from the Iranians. You don't get enrichment and you don't get a nuclear program that is capable of developing Nuclear Weapons. Our gold standard is the American standard civilian nuclear energy, like 23 countries, no enrichment and ROCs. We should be consistent. We should be consistent not just with American allies, but also very clear with American enemies. I think that's the third important thing we do. Fourth is I think we, it's really important that we find some kind of accommodation between the Israelis and the Palestinians. We can go down many rabbit holes on that, but I think that lays the predicate for a Saudi Israeli normalization deal that then brings in multiple Arab countries and Muslim countries.\n\nAnd finally is, we talked about the Abraham Accords. I, I think we need to start thinking about what did the Cyrus Accords look like, right? Cyrus was the great Persian king, right? Who by the way brought the, you know, the Jews back from, from the diaspora to Jerusalem and Cyrus Accords would be, let's find an agreement between the United States and Israel and Iran, right? That would be a remarkable transformation in the region if we could actually do that. So imagine the Middle East, and again, I know this sounds fanciful, but I think this is what Trump has in mind when he starts to talk about the things you're seeing in these truth posts is actually the Middle East that can be fundamentally transformed where we actually do bring peace between Israel, Iran, Saudi Arabia, and the rest of these countries.\n\nI by the way, completely agree with you on Syria, the idea that we are trusting a former Al-Qaeda ISIS jihadist to rule Syria, I think is a big bet President Trump has made, he's made it on the advice of MBS. We'll see how that transforms or transpires and see if Syria has transformed. But the notion that somehow we should just be rolling the dice, lifting all the sanctions and taking this former Al-Qaeda jihadist at his word is a big bet if we get the bet right? That is actually a remarkable occurrence because now all of a sudden Syria and Lebanon are brought into this Abraham Accords, Cyrus Accords structure.\n\nAnd then we actually have, what I think all three of us want is peace in the Middle East, stability in the Middle East. I don't think we need democracy in the Middle East. I think if the Middle East looked like the UAE, that'd be a pretty good Middle East. I think we'd all be pretty comfortable with that if that kind of stability and prosperity. And ultimately you could put these countries on a pathway to greater democracy the way that we did during the Cold War where countries like Taiwan and South Korea that were military dictatorships ended up becoming pro-Western democracy. So that's kind of stepping back maybe a little bit Pollyannish, but I think we should also always keep in mind what a potential vision for peace could look like.\n\nSo Scott, as many people know here in Austin, Texas, you're the director of The Libertarian Institute. Let's zoom out a bit. What are the key pillars of Libertarianism and how that informs how you see the world?\n\nWell, very basis of Libertarianism is the non-aggression principle, but which essentially is the same thing as our, our social rules for dealing with each other in private life. No force, no theft, no fraud, and keep your hands to yourself. And we apply that same moral law to government. And so, you know, some libertarians are in our non-capitalist, some are so-called monarchists, meaning we want the absolute minimum amount of government a night watchman type state in, in other words, just enough to enforce contracts and protect property rights and allow freedom and a free market to work. There's also, of course a natural rights theory, Austrian school economics and a lot of revisionist history.\n\nAnd, and it, something very key to libertarian theory was, is expressed by Marianne Rothbard was that war is the key to the whole libertarian business because especially in the United States of America, as long as we maintain a world empire makes it impossible for us to have a limited and decentralized government here at home as our constitution describes. And so it's gonna crack a joke, but neither of you have called me an isolationist yet. But I was gonna joke, yes, as, as Thomas Jefferson wrote in the Declaration of Isolation, the, the same guy, a principal author of the Declaration of Isolation, he said in his first inaugural address, we seek peace, commerce and honest friendship with all nations and entangling alliances with none.\n\nAnd that's the true libertarian philosophy. Thank Dr Ron Paul, the great congressman for many years up there, he was supposed to all sanctions, all economic war on the rest of the world and the entire state of the United States as world empire. And what's strange now is that anyone who wants just peace as the standard is considered an isolationist. And people who are for world empire and a permanent state of conflict with the rest of the world, economic war coups and regime changes and even invasions, those are considered normal people. It's almost like people who want peace should be called cis foreign policy. 'cause now we gotta, we have to come up with a funny word to describe a normal state of being when no one calls Mexico an isolationist state.\n\nJust 'cause they mind their own business. And is there any faction anywhere in America that calls themself isolationist? Even the paleo conservatives who favor much more like trade protectionism and that kind of thing than libertarians. They don't call themselves isolationists, they still want to have an open relationship with the world to some degree when isolation means like the hermit kingdom of North Korea or some crazy thing like that. No one wants that for the United States of America. What we want is independence, non interventionism and peace.\n\nSo to you, isolationism is a kind of dirty word\n\nTo describe that's a smear term. It's a mir term invented by interventionists and internationalists to attack anyone who didn't want to go along with their agenda. The term itself is used essentially as a smear against anyone who doesn't want to Go to war.\n\nSo can you actually just deeper describe what non interventionism means? So how much sort of display of military strength should be there, do you think?\n\nDr. Paul said we could defend this country with a couple of good submarines, which by the way, for people who don't know, one American trident sub could essentially kill every city and military base in Russia, just one. So he's absolutely right about that. A couple of good submarines are enough to defend our coasts and deter anyone from messing with the United States of America. And then I admit, I'm a little bit idealistic about this, that I think of that old William Jennings, Bryan Speech Beholder Republic, where unlike the empires of Europe burdened under the weight of militarism, here we have a free country and where you know what we could do?\n\nWe could be the host of peace conferences everywhere. There are frozen conflicts in the conflicts in the donbas, in Leningrad, in Transtria, in Taiwan, in Korea, virtually all the borders of Africa and Eurasia were drawn by European powers to either divide and conquer their enemies or artificially group their enemies together in order to keep them internally divided and conquered in those ways. So there are great many borders in the world that are in contention and that people might even want to fight about. And I think that America could play a wonderful role in helping to negotiate and resolve those types of conflicts without resorting to force or, or even making any promises on the part of the US government.\n\nLike we'll pay Egypt to pretend to be nice to Israel or anything like that, but just find ways to host conferences and, and find resolutions to these problems. And I think quite sincerely that Donald Trump right now could get on a plane to Tehran. He could then Go to Moscow, to Beijing and Pyongyang and he could come home and be Trump the great, we in fact don't have to have the, especially the American hyper power as the French called it, the world empire. We have everything to give and nothing to lose to go ahead. And Donald Trump even talked like this. You might remember when he first was sworn in this time, he said, you know what, instead of pivoting from terrorism to great power competition with Russia and China, I don't wanna do that.\n\nI just want to get along with both of them. Let's just move on and have the rest of the century be peace and prosperity and not fighting at all. Why should we have to pivot to China? Let's just pivot to capitalism and trade and freedom. And peace. That's America first. Yeah, I,\n\nI've of criticize Trump a lot, but I think maybe he's just rhetoric, but I think he talks about peace a lot. Even just recently, the, the number of times the word peace is mentioned and with seriousness, not you get like a genuine desire for peace from him. And that's just beautiful to see for the leader of, of this country. And\n\nLook man, there used to be a time when a third of the planet was dominated by the communists, right? So like I'm not gonna sit here and argue the first cold war with you. My book's about the second one and I'm not as good on the first. But since the end of the first Cold War, we have let the neoconservative policy of the defense planning guidance of 92 and rebuilding America's defenses and the rest of this American dominance centered policy control our entire direction in the world. It's led to the war on terrorism in the Middle East, seven countries we've attacked. It's led to the disaster in Eastern Europe and its leading toward disaster in Eastern Asia when there's just no reason in the world that it has to be this way with the comms dead and gone.\n\nAnd again, I to stipulate here, the Chinese flag is still red, it's still a one party dictatorship, but they have abandoned Marxism. I mean people were starving to death by the tens of millions there. It's a huge, it's probably the greatest improvement in the condition of mankind anywhere ever in the shortest amount of time when Deng Xiaoping in the right wing of the communist party took over in that country. Just\n\nOne more thing, you mentioned the two submarines. What's the role of Nuclear Weapons?\n\nWell, I would like for America to have an extremely minimal nuclear deterrent and work toward a world free of Nuclear Weapons. And I know that that sounds utopian. However, I would remind your audience that Ronald Reagan and Mikal Gorbachev came within a hair of achieving a deal just like that at Kovic Iceland in 1986. And they were both of them dead serious about it, complete and total nuclear disarmament. And then Reagan was essentially bullied by Richard Pearl and others on his staff saying, you promised the American people that you would build them a defensive anti missile system, the Star Wars system, which was total pie in the sky technological fantasy of the 1980s.\n\nAnd if you're getting rid of all the ICBMs, then why the hell do you a need a missile shield anyway? Is the world's probably greatest tragedy that ever took place that Ronald Reagan walked away from those negotiations. They literally were within a hair and it wasn't magic and there was no trust in evil, bad guys. This is, by the way, two years before the wall came down, this is when everybody still thought the USSR was gonna last. And Reagan had the plan was that America and the Soviet Union would dismantle our Nuclear Weapons until we were right around with parody with the other Nuclear Weapons states who all have right around two or 300 nukes France, Britain at that time, Israel and China, Indian Pakistan came later.\n\nSouth Africa only had a few of them, but gave up whatever they had. And the idea was we would get down to two or 300 and then America and the Soviet Union both together would lean hard on Britain, France, and China.",
