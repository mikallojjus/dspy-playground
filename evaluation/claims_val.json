      "transcript_chunk": "th, you know, horrific expert as the joke used to be. Even Hitler, you know, he used to love dogs. So that's the joke. Right. You know, and, and that, but there's some real truth in understanding the human process in that, that somebody who makes the absolute worst decision in the world can still be a loving father.\n\nMm.\n\nYou know, can still have a group of friends, but on, you know, a particular, in a particular moment that is the same person who's made this horrific decision that will have terrible effect on a, a generation of people.\n\nYeah. I mean it's, it's really the same kind of thing we were talking about with Tony Soprano.\n\nRight.\n\nLike that this, this person is a terrible person, but yet loves his kids. Right. Loves his friends. Yeah.\n\nWell, charm is one of the greatest weapons of evil. Yeah. You know, it's, it's a really, you know, it's a, it's a fun thing for us. We see somebody, you know, who can tell a story, tell a joke, hold a tension in a room. Yeah. You go, it's cool. But when that process of charm goes to this other place, which becomes about life and death or the're taking away of people's rights, the dehumanizing of people as we were discussing earlier, you know, and there's, you know, I, I don't want to get into politics 'cause I have this, my, my boys have this rule. If you're gonna talk to Joe, you're not allowed to discuss politics.\n\nBecause they know once I start your boys, my, my two sons\n\nYeah's. Because my youngest boy, I think I told you, he, he became obsessed with you and, and listening to your st stuff for a while. And you became one of his sort of points of education and, you know, so that's why I started listening to you. 'cause I wanted to know what he was hearing, you know? And I go and I, I, after listening a few times, I was like, you know what man, it's cool. You know, the 'cause again, we'll use that, that word you do actually have the allowance for nuance. And that's the greatest thing about this situation. We sit down to talk, we're gonna be talking for a couple of hours. Yeah. So I don't have to reduce everything. I wanna talk to you about to make it pop in three minutes.\n\nRight. And worry about things being taken outta context in a soundbite. Right? Yeah. That this is the issue with discussing any positive attribute to a Nazi. You know what I mean? Like, you, you open up that door. Oh my God. Russell Crowe's a Nazi sympathizer.\n\nBut the people that\n\nDon't like you are just gonna take that.\n\nYeah. Yeah. And here's what Joe Rogan's discussing. Yeah,\n\nYeah, yeah. But it's, I think what you're saying is absolutely true. That it is stupid to think that way because it, because that's a human being and a very fucked up evil human being that did horrific things. But know that that is a path that people can go down even if they think they're doing the right thing. So we\n\nAre taught, for example, to regard Gaddafi in a certain way. Okay. But if you look into what happened in his country while he was the leader, you look into the fact that every person is given a house at a certain age. You look at the fact that everybody's education and healthcare is free. You look at, if somebody showed a particular talent for something that required further education overseas, all of the costs of that were paid for by the government. Now these are all things put in place by the same country's leader that we are told is evil and corrupt.\n\nYeah.\n\nSo it doesn't quite balance.\n\nWell, there's also us government interference. That's a, that's a, that is one that we definitely monkeyed with. I mean, he ran afoul of the United States government, you know,\n\nWell, what he was trying to do, as far as I understand the situation is he was trying to unite Africa and a United Africa is gonna be, it's a problem. Well, either it's gonna be fantastic. Right. It's gonna be amazing.\n\nA problem for the people that wanna run things. Yeah. Yeah. If all of a sudden there's a new Subaru\n\nPower, you've got a whole bunch of countries that, that, you know, have a connection with a certain African nation or whatever that suck their, you know, minerals out of the ground or whatever, don't pay them properly for it. Yep. You know, and and greatly benefit financially. And that's pretty much every European country's got some kind of African connection in that regard. And\n\nIncluding China.\n\nWell, China's now coming in. Yeah. Because it's able to offer a slightly better deal than they've been used to, you know? But people have to understand you. The population of Africa is enormous. Yeah. Enormous. You've got multiple countries with hundreds of millions of people.\n\nWell, when you see the continent of Africa and you see all these other countries, how many would fit inside of it? You're like, oh boy. Yeah. 'cause that's the weird thing about maps and globes is you get a distortion of the actual true\n\nSize. Well there is a distortion, right? Yeah. Whatever that's called, which shows America at the center and being physically a larger landmass than it actually is in relative terms. Oh, it's\n\nA little bit, it is the size of Australia.\n\nA hundred thousand square miles. Continental USA is a hundred thousand square miles larger than the island of Australia.\n\nThat's not much. Not\n\nMuch.\n\nThat's not much. It's not much, man. Especially when you think that you guys have 20 what? 25? 25. And we have probably 325 plus. Right. I don't think we know really how many people we have, but we have at least 320 million. Yeah, that's a lot of folks.\n\nA lot of people man. Yeah. It's a hell of a lot of people.\n\nSo we'd like to think we're a lot bigger than we are, but then you look at where we fit in Africa, you're like, oh, it's like, it's a little tiny little tiny thing.\n\nI think there's someone like 55 countries or something in Africa.\n\nI don't know. It's probably, yeah. I mean it's also Egypt. That's the other thing, you know, it's also like the most advanced civilization possibly that ever existed before today. And they were there too. It's like, it's a wild place. Like from top to bottom. It's a very, and it's the origin possibly of humankind\n\nAnd a lot more desert, I think, than, than people realize. You know, you have the Sahara and stuff, we all know that. But then there's these other gigantic areas like that. But would that be the West coast? Have you seen those roads in like Namibia or whatever where it's just, it's like a sand dune. It's 40, 50 meters high, drops down to the ocean and there's one little flat bit that there's a road. And that's possible, you know, at certain times or whatever, if the tides are not doing this and that, but that's the road. Jeez. It's like a mountain of sand and an ocean and a one little ribbon.\n\nGeez. It's, you know, United States is one of the weird things about us is that we're, we're a country that thinks mostly of ourselves and hardly ever leaves. You know, some people leave, but yeah, I bet there's a solid percentage of people that never leave the United States and maybe never even leave their city. Right. And your version of the world, you're relying on other people to give you the story of what the world is. Until you go somewhere, until you go to Thailand, until you go somewhere and you're like, wow, there's a totally different way of living out here.\n\nYeah. I've even had people, you know, come down to help me with movies or whatever, like guys that are coming down to train me and some weapon or other or whatever, and they do a lot of traveling, but it's all within the continental USA.\n\nYeah.\n\nAnd they come to Australia and they didn't realize that other people have opinions. You're not gonna find a heck of a lot of agreement to, you know, some very basic tenants. If you sit in an Australian bar, you'll find a whole bunch of people go, that's fucking stupid, mate.\n\nYeah.\n\nYou know? But look, it's still, to me it's the, the greatest country in the world is the United States of America. Absolutely greatest potentials are all here. But how it's founded on balance and fairness and opportunity, that's how it remains. Great. Not because you start taking opportunity away from people. Right. Because you are affording them opportunity. And, you know, just, it's,\n\nJust\n\nKeep that in mind, ladies and Gentlemen. Yes.\n\nBecause\n\nIt, nothing's finished, nothing's done. We're just in the process and it can all get better. For sure.\n\nYeah. And it's the rare country that is almost entirely founded by people moving here over time. Yeah.\n\nIt's all immigration.\n\nYeah. Yeah. Which is the strength. And also, you know, the, the problem with the last four years was that they were just letting anybody in and they weren't vetting people. Right. And they were inviting people in. And the problem now is they're grabbing people that are productive citizens and they're grabbing 'em and taking 'em out. 'cause they don't have the right paperwork. Yeah. So neither one is a good solution and both of them cause huge problems. Yeah. And one of the scary things. But\n\nYou do have to be aware too, though, a lot of the information that we know about that is coming to us from a motivation that we don't necessarily read. Right. They want us to think of things in negative terms. Sure.\n\nBoth sides. On both sides of the issue. Yeah. A hundred percent. Yeah. We're, we're constantly being manipulated. I had Representative Luna on the podcast and one of the things that she said that that, that I kind of knew was probably true, but I didn't wanna believe it. She was like, there's a lot of problems they never solve on purpose, so that they could campaign against them. And that's why they, they keep these things in play. That resolutions could have been reached, problems could have been solved. But these politicians are so self-serving that they don't ever want that to take place. Yeah. These people that run, these two individual parties want to keep that, that banter back and forth. They wanna keep the argument going. And\n\nYou see how absolute they are. If you know somebody with that color hat is trying to promote something, you know, the person with the other color hat. So that's absolutely ridiculous. Then it changes. An election happens. Now the person with a different colored hat, they're in charge and they're gonna put in place exactly what they said the other person was doing that was wrong. Yeah. Is now part of their policy platform.\n\nWhat is wrong with the way Australia's run? Well,\n\nWe're a little bit lucky at the moment. We have a prime minister who's very much motivated by trying to help everybody, you know, which should be the job of a politician, right? Sure. To improve the lives of the people that they represent. And he's kind of inherited, You know, a conga line of stupidity that was going on, you know, and he's trying to fix things. But of course, just the way things are reported, whatever, you know, there's, there's haters on every corner. But he's a good man and he's doing his very best and he's, you know, working extremely hard. But, you know, like he arrives off a plane the other day. He's just come back home from some very successful international meetings where he is established various trade things and, and opportunities and situations for Australia. Gets off the plane wearing a Joy Division T-shirt. Right. Big band from his youth. And he's just a relaxed character. You know, he's been wearing a suit and tie for weeks on the road. He's just walking off Australia's version of Air Force One in the Joy Division t-shirt. So the member of the opposition wanted to point out and did so in parliament that joy division is a Nazi term and comes from a section of a particular camp where the women were prostituted. And that's why it was called the Joy Division. And it's like, okay, what's the point of that? Right. We all know it's a band name. We know it's, it's a band name. Right. And just 'cause you like the Rolling Stones doesn't mean that you want rocks to be falling on people. What are you fucking talking about? You know, this whole stupidity and that's what you're facing all the time. Picking up some pointless piece of minutia and, you know, lighting it on fire and making a smokescreen to cover up the reality of the fact that that Prime Minister just worked his ass off on behalf of the country and successfully achieved a bunch of things and should be patted on the back, you know, not pushed down the stairs.\n\nYeah. Well we have a lot of that here too. That's,\n\nBut there is a timidity to a timidity I think is probably the thing in terms of how Australia is run. Things like the, the gambling ads and stuff like that. Common sense would tell you this is not a good thing to allow, you know, put the timing of these ads back so kids are asleep or whatever. Don't let them read out the odds on the news that you could fix that pretty quick. But that gambling section of the community is worth a lot of money and people in positions of power. 'cause it's not necessarily, you know, it's, it's not the guy that's gonna spend his whole wages gambling through an app that, that gets to have a say in this. You know, it's the guy whose family money allows him to run a string of 18, you know, race horses and he enjoys going to the races on the weekend. And, you know, gambling for him is not such a big deal because he's got, you know, an income from other things, blah, blah, blah. You know, so it's the wrong perspective on a problem sometimes is the actual problem.\n\nMm. And the fact that this is a fairly new thing and that young people growing up with this, there's not a history of people abusing gambling apps. Right. It's not, it's not something their parents had to deal with. It's\n\nRight. Generationally. It's not something that I can, oh, I, you know, from my experience, I can tell you this, so I had to have a, you know, when I had that conversation with my boys, it was a broader conversation about gambling and about, you know, what it takes to earn a dollar.\n\nYeah. The, I think the accessibility issue is something that people have problem with. The fact that it's on a phone versus going to a place, right. You choose to, you're gonna get your buddies together. You are gonna go play poker in a casino. Right. That's a different decision, right. Yeah.\n\nThan just sitting at home. Yeah. You know, and just constantly frittering away your money. Well\n\nThis is the thing, it's just we are, there's always some sort of point of attack. There's always an attack vector for people getting your attention or getting your money and trying to, and then we have to decide as a society, like do we, is this good to just allow, like we want freedom, but do we want to, like you can't advertise cigarettes on TV anymore. Right. They decided at one point in time, this is crazy. Cigarettes are bad for, you can advertise\n\nAlcohol,\n\nYou still can. Yeah. Yeah. Which\n\nIs weird. That's a certain time of day. Yeah.\n\nIt's weird. Yeah, it's weird. 'cause alcohol probably kills more people than cigarettes.\n\nThat funny thing that we have that was fed to us that, you know, cigarettes are this incredible burden on our health healthcare system. In reality, if you look at it, it's a burden. But, you know, there's a lot of people dying of lung cancer who've never had a cigarette. So we haven't really solved that. We don't really know where that's coming from. But in reality, the burden on our healthcare system is obesity and all the problems that come from obesity. That's the biggest. Yeah. We allow food production systems that we know to be extremely unhealthy and very bad. We just allow them to continue on. You know, we've got items of quote unquote food that have been tested and turns out there's no actual food in this. It's just, you know, a manufactured product. I think the, the famous one here was the, the Twine thing. Right? When they actually got around to looking at what was in a twine, they realized that every single part of it was completely unhealthy. Yeah.",

      "transcript_chunk": "Joe Rogan podcast. Check out\n\nThe Joe Rogan experience\n\nTrain by Day. Joe Rogan podcast by night all day,\n\nGentlemen. How are you, sir? Good to\n\nSee you. Joe Rogan. Yeah.\n\nGood to see you.\n\nNice to see you, man. Your\n\nMovie's great.\n\nThank you very much.\n\nWhen does it come out\n\nIn the United States? It comes out November 7th. Okay. And then various dates over the next month and a half or so around the rest of the world.\n\nIt's a fucking heavy movie, man. Yeah. It's a heavy movie. Yeah. The, the trial, that footage, was that all real footage? The Holocaust footage? Yeah. Real footage of the, the\n\nPlow. That was one of the, one of the reasons that that inspired Jamie to go ahead. That he was given access to that footage, some of which has never been seen since 1946. Oh. You know, it's a very interesting way that he makes the subject matter accessible because it's such a dry topic from the outside. Right. Here's a court case. Right. You know, he's yet another courtroom drama. Right. Procedural or whatever. So I can imagine that people would see that and go, well, that's, you know, might not be an exciting watch or something, but he sort of puts the audience in this position where he allows them to start to be amused by some of the things that are going on and the interpersonal relationships. And, you know, when the commandant of the prison has to call up his two top mental health experts and dress them down for getting into a fist fire, you know, things like that kind of, it, it's, there's a charm to it. And then he gets you into the courtroom and he locks the door. Mm. And he goes, now you're gonna see what we're talking about. So I think it's a very interesting film device to disarm people before he starts giving them the, the real juice, you know?\n\nYeah. It's, it's also a fascinating psychological tape from the psychiatrist, from Kelly's perspective, you know, because the way he's describing all human beings, that all human beings are capable of these horrific acts. Yeah.\n\nAnd that's the thing that was a very unpopular take at the time, actually led to his removal from the process, because he wasn't fulfilling what the war department wanted him to say. Yeah. Which is, you know, all Nazis are crazy, you know, ruled by a mad man, and this is a unique experience, but that's not what he found. In sitting down talking to the 22 major Nazi sort of names that, that he was assigned to post-war, he realized that every single one of these people was, you know, as normal. Well, there was a couple that were pretty out there, but, you know, for the most part, he was dealing with rational men.\n\nYeah. That's what's scary. And\n\nHow the hell did they end up making this series of decisions if they're rational men? Well,\n\nIt just seems like things just get pushed slowly but surely into this unbelievably horrific place. Right. Like, it starts off, there's just, it's just a war. It starts off Hitler's in power, and then slowly but surely things get pushed incrementally. Yes.\n\nAnd that's the thing that's, you know, difficult because gigantic jumps we can all read. Right. But little incremental changes. Right.\n\nThe boiling of the frog,\n\nJust how, you know, you take away this person's rights, that person's personal power, you know, and slowly, you know, you get to a point where the average person then turns around and goes, how did we get to here? Right. You know, I thought it was, I thought it was about something else. You know, there's a smoke screen going up and I thought we were doing that, and as it turns out, it's very different.\n\nYeah. That's the one of the scariest aspects of human beings is our ability to dehumanize others, to turn others into something less than us non-human and other humans with families, with mothers and fathers and children. It's\n\nOne of the most dangerous things. I, I see it going on everywhere at the moment that we're trying to say that you're either, you know, and for one or of a better teen name that you're either red or that you're blue. Right. And humans are far more nuanced than that. They're not, we're not that extreme, you know? And that the idea that you can split all of us into two camps, it's kind of nuts.\n\nIt's nuts, you know? Yeah. It's\n\nNuts. And it takes out all the room for subtlety in a discussion, and therefore it makes communicating with each other less and less available. Well,\n\nIt's just, in this country in particular, I don't know about Australian politics, but we only have two parties, and they're both essentially financed by enormous corporations. So it's a, it's a ruse. The whole thing's a ruse. Right. And you have different social issues on each side that come up and, and then it becomes this year with us or against us. Right. Versus left. But it's, there's,\n\nIt's going nowhere good.\n\nNowhere good. Yeah.\n\nYeah. We have the same sort of, you know, two principle party system in Australia as well. But we have a slight advantage in that we are kind of on the edge of the world in a lot of ways, you know, so what I've always said is, when you're growing up in Australia and New Zealand, you're growing, you grow up looking out. Yes. You understand your own culture and all that, but you grow up looking out what else is happening in the rest of the world. What, what's happening in Europe, what's happening in America, you know, but by and large Americans grow up looking in,\n\nRight.\n\nThe principal sports are only played by American teams, American football, baseball in some instances, baseball. But they're not the types of sports that we play. Where the pinnacle of that sport is international competition. Right. Rugby union. Right. Rugby league, cricket. Right. Football, soccer, you know, so we, we grow at, with that as being the pinnacle of any particular sport if you get to represent your country. And that's only really relevant in an American sense for in an Olympic period, you know? Right.\n\nThat's it. Yeah. We never think about other sports. We mock them. We think about, you know, like, what are you doing playing cricket? You know?\n\nAnd it's a fascinating game. It's any, anybody who loves baseball generally, I've found baseball lovers are all about the minutiae. They're all about the stats and what those stats mean. You know, there might be a certain score on the board, but, you know, their, and their team might be getting beaten, but they see in the stats that there's, you know, a certain dominance in an area. And so they, you know, they still have a hope that the outcome of the game is, is may come their way. And cricket fans are, are the same as that. So the, the fact that the two never seem to meet is odd to me. It is odd. 'cause it's the same type of game.\n\nThis is, cricket is larger worldwide. Right? Much larger.\n\nYeah. Well you have the India. India and Pakistan. Yeah. And Sri Lanka and you know, countries like that with huge populations playing the game.\n\nDid you, do you guys have home runs in cricket, like where someone really cracks the ball and smashes outta the park? It's,\n\nIt's called a six. If you hit the ball over the fence without a bouncing, you get six runs. Oh, okay. And so that's, that's the run. Does that happen often in, see there's different forms of the game. You have T 20, then you have one day. So this is gonna be, this is gonna be difficult. T 20 means that each team gets to bowl 20 overs. An over is six balls. So you have 26 ball overs that you're bowling to the batting team. And they've gotta get, try and get as many runs as they can. Okay. And then you'll have a go at batting, right? So you have that version of the game, which is very short. It can be, it can happen in an evening. Then you have a one day game, which maybe, you know, starts in the afternoon, finishes by eight or nine at night. But then you have the test match. And this is what I grew up with it. It's sort of been dialed down a little bit now 'cause they brought in shorter forms of the game. But the test match is between two countries and it's played over five days. And the idea is that both teams have to bat and bowl twice. And the result will be whatever it is at the end of five days.\n\nThis episode is brought to you by, called Dara lab.

My cousin Martin was a great cricket player. He was the captain of New Zealand. My other cousin Jeffrey was also a captain of New Zealand. So I kind of grew up in a cricketing family. And it was one of the pathways for me. There was, you know, potentially play cricket, you know. But when you've got two of your cousins who are as good as they were, it's a very crowded room. You know, s like, well how am I gonna make any kind of statement here? When one of the Martin, at his peak, he was called by Sports Illustrated, I believe the Michael Jordan of world Cricket. Wow. He was a very dominant player in his day. And he used to call, we used to discuss test matches as the gentleman's war. 'cause you have a defined space, you have X amount of players and you've gotta stop that little ball in this gigantic 180 meter by 120 meter oval. You've gotta stop that little red ball from going between the players and therefore, you know, preventing the batsman from scoring runs. But that five day game, the way that it ebbs and flows, once you're into it, it's the only way you wanna watch cricket. 'cause it's like, you know, at one moment your team can be just so far ahead. You're like, Ugh. Just, you know, and then it'll turn on a dime and day two things get really dark for your team. You know, day three, you got an edge back again, day four. It's fantastic, man. And as a kid I used to go and attend every day of a five day game. Wow. Yeah. It was crazy.\n\nYeah, there's nothing like that here.\n\nNo, no. I mean, I mean, it really requires, I mean, just like, look at the, you know, five, five day game, it's like five news cycles, right? Yeah. We're not really set up for that sort of patience. And\n\nHow is it broadcast? Is it stream television? Television? Yeah, yeah,\n\nYeah. Yeah. I mean, you know, there's cables and companies and stuff have got involved now, but it used to be national network. And when cricket season was on, I mean, you know, back in the day people would come from overseas and into Australia and the summer and, and ask the question, is there anything else on television except sport.\n\nIs it, so when, when you're, do they take commercial breaks? Yep. Okay. They do. So that's the problem with soccer, right? Soccer in America, the reason why it's very hard to sell is not just that a lot of people don't play it right, but it's says there's no commercial breaks. Right.\n\nThey just keep going. You have a huge number of people who play association football, soccer in this country. Oh,\n\nFor sure. Listen, they have a, a professional team here. I've been to the game, but it's nowhere near the involvement that football has\n\nAmerican football, American football in this country. Yeah, for\n\nSure. Not even close. Yeah.\n\nWell see, all of our sports that we like in Australia, apart from cricket, tend to be quite compact. You know, 80 minute game, 90 minute game, 10 minute halftime, and it's part of your day. It's not your whole day. Right. It's like, we'll go to a football game and then we'll go and, you know, have dinner or go and do something else. So we have that same thing where the action is so continuous that the idea of stopping for a commercial break quite gets quite tricky.\n\nYeah, that makes sense. It's always been fascinating to me that rugby never took off in America. Yeah. Because it seems like kind of a more savage version of football. Yeah.\n\nWell the, the way I think it sort of plays out is you've got rugby union, right? Which is 15 men aside. Every time a player is tackled, you re-compete for the ball. You have rocks, mos, you have line outs. It's a very different game. But there's another version of rugby called Rugby League, which was played in the north of England. And that has a defined period of offense and defense. And I think that's where American football comes from. I actually own a team in Australia in the NRL, the National Rugby League, the South Sydney rabbits, the oldest team in the game, 1908, we were formed, bought the team in 2006. And it's very easy to explain to Americans, have American friends come down. I spend maybe 20 minutes talking to them and they get the game and they start to dig it. My girlfriend at the moment, actually Brittany, was one of the reasons why I really started being attracted to her because she understood the game straight away, you know? And then I find out that when she was younger, she was a cheerleader for the New Orleans Saints.\n\nOh,\n\nWow. While she was studying electrical engineering. So it, yeah, it, it's a very similar, rugby league is a very easy game for Americans to follow. Now, how it's refereed becomes frustrating where an American audience, because it's, there's so much room for interpretation, referee to referee game to game situation to situation. So it can get frustrating. I think one of the greatest things about American football from the outside, or from an objective point of view, it seems that every single thing that the, the NFL try to do is based on and across the board fairness for everyone. Mm. You know, so those, you know, the conversations were between the referees and what have you seemed to be, everybody's on the same page. And sometimes when you're watching rugby league, something that you saw somebody else get sent from the field for the week before, and now nothing happens this week, but it's the same kind of hit or whatever. I was like, what? You know, so I, I've had a few Americans get corrupt, very frustrated. Is that corruption? No, I think that's, yeah. I think it, the game moves very fast. Right. And, you know, referees don't have eyes on all sides of their head, you know?",

      "transcript_chunk": "I won't even guess, but I think Clapton was living in New York or London or somewhere. And he had a, he had a, a party at his house and it, 'cause he just had that record come out and it would gone number one. And he had it stuck on his fridge with a magnet. You know, like the charts with a circle around it, you know, I shot the sheriff number one, Eric Clapton and Bob Marley was at the party and apparently he found a pen and he wrote onto Clapton's fridge. No, Eric, I shot the sheriff Bob,\n\nI shot him first Bitch.\n\nThat's\n\nHilarious. But that uncut gems film is it, is it, it it, it is a perfect movie in regards to like the way it treats a degenerate gambler. He's a jewelry broker, jewelry salesman. And he's just out of his fucking mind. It's always sports, it's always this, it's, there's, there's always a game that's going on and he's betting this and it, you get so much anxiety watching the movie like, oh God, don't do that. Right. Don't do that. Don't. Oh Jesus, what are you doing? It's like the whole movie. My palms are sweating. I'm moving around in my chair because I as a kid grew up in pool halls, like from the time not grew up in pool halls, but I spent so much time between age 23 and you know, into my thirties. I was in pool halls all the time. Right. And I played a lot of pool and I was around a lot of addicted campers. And I never got it, it never hit me. But I was always just fascinated by the grip that it had on people. It was like they would, their eyes would be going back and forth. Their fucking skin would be pale. It gripped them like a drug. It gripped them like crystal meth.\n\nI, I really dislike the way in Australia we have normalized it. You know, they're doing a sports report on the news, the national news. And they'll tell you the odds. The odds.\n\nWell we do that with the UFC. The UFC. We give the odds they, they even, I don't know if they announce round by round odds, but the, I think they do, but the, I don't, I try to pay attention to it 'cause I don't vote. I, excuse me, I don't gamble on the UFC but I used to, so I used to gamble on the UFC when I first started working for them. And then I was like, I don't think I should do this anymore. No, probably not. This is a long time ago though. So what I started doing is giving my friend Aubrey, who's my business partner at on it. I started giving him tips and he was like 84%. Right? 'cause I know the sport. And a lot of these guys would be coming from Japan or coming from Russia. And I'd be like, oh, this guy on from Brazil, Anderson Silva bet the fucking house. Right? I go bet the fucking house. 'cause people do\n\nNot my house though, your\n\nHouse, not my house. But there's people that were coming across from other organizations that I was a giant fan of and the bookmakers were woefully uneducated about, especially foreign fighters. Right. And there's a thing like if you are gambling on MMA and you don't know how to fight, you're just guessing. You don't really, we're all just guessing when two guys get into the cage together. But you're really guessing. Like you really don't, you can't recognize like how fast a person is. You can't recognize how good they're at countering. You just know stats. Right. You know, but you don't know how to do it. And if you don't know how to do it, you can't really see it. You don't really know. So at A certain point in time I stopped just on my own gambling 'cause I like, I don't, 'cause I was, people were accusing me of being biased one way or the other anyway. Right. Which maybe I was, you know, I got better at that. But I wanted to make sure that no one thought that. So I was like, I'm only gambling. I'm a couple hundred bucks or something like that. I wasn't doing anything crazy. Right. But the, the fucking people that I have friends, like good friends that are just hooked and when they start talking about like fights that they're gambling on or they put so much money on this and money on that, I'm like, oh my god guy. I know guys that put millions of dollars on a fight. I'm like, oh my god. Yeah. You're freaking me out. You're fucking freaking me out man. I don't care how wealthy you are. If you put a $3 million bet on a fight and you lose, like you're not gonna sleep for a week,\n\nMan. I just wouldn't be able to wake up with myself the next day.\n\nAnd then if win, I would\n\nFeel so foolish.\n\nIf you win, it might be even worse. 'cause now you're gonna keep doing it.\n\nNow you get that, you get the sting. Yeah. The thing is with, with what we do in Australia, like the newspapers, like you know, network news services, we allow betting ads. It is so all prevailing. You know, I had an experience probably a year or two ago and I see my two boys are talking to a mate of theirs and they've all got their phones out And I realized they were checking up on their bets. You know, so I had to have a big conversation with my boys and say, look, every single dollar that you have comes outta my pocket. If I give you a dollar, that's not a dollar to gamble with. I had to have very serious conversation with 'em about, it's like, I don't care if you think it's fun, you know, I don't care. You've gotta actually see it for what it is. Yeah. Because what's five or $10 now is easily gonna turn into four or $500 in a minute. A thousand dollars. You know, sooner or later you will allow yourself to think that this thing is, you know, beyond fun and it's a way for you to earn back your losses or whatever. Right. So I just had a, had to have a, a chat with 'em and they were probably looking at me going, how old is our father that he doesn't understand that everybody does this? You know? But I just had to let 'em know from my point of view, I didn't appreciate them taking my hard earned dollars and wasting them.\n\nI get it. But I also like that it exists because I want the ability, like if I wasn't working for the UFC and I could go to the fights and gamble on the fights, I would definitely do it because it a knowledge, it wasn't to\n\nMe. Right.\n\nThis episode is brought to you by Uber Eats every football season, the same thing happens. The game somehow makes everyone really hungry. Quarterback scrambles, clearly assigned it's time for breakfast burritos, turnovers suddenly dessert at 2:00 PM doesn't sound so crazy. And wing formations. Well those can only mean buffalo wings as if they're ever not in play. Even the goalposts start looking suspiciously like french fries. It's almost like football is sending the message to eat more food. The good news Uber Eats makes those cravings easy to satisfy with game day deals all season long from wings and pizza to chips and drinks. Even last minute grocery runs, you'll find savings on all your favorites delivered straight to your door. Order Now on Uber Eats,\n\nI don't need it. If I'm into the sport. Yeah. I want to see the game, you know, I, I care about Oh yeah. What happens in the game. I\n\nGet it.\n\nPossibly because from the owner point of view, I don't, I wouldn't want any extra pressure. Of course. So I, I don't understand why here's, here's this game. It's like two teams of pristine athletes who have busted their nuts to get in this situation. And the competition, the physical competition between these two teams isn't enough. You gotta put something else on the line, you know? Well it just adds,\n\nIt adds for some people,\n\nFor some people. Yeah. Yeah.\n\nThey get that extra juice out of the knowing that, the thing is also as a commentator, I am as unbiased as humanly possible. And it's a hard thing when friends fight. 'cause there's some guys that fight that are my good friends and I'm, I'm like, I just hope they don't get hurt and I want 'em to win. But I have to be excited about the other guy winning, which is kind of crazy. The other guy's beating up your friend. Right, right. And you have to be excited about it. So it's good that I don't have any money riding on fights 'cause I don't have, I'm not happy if one person wins or loses. Right. My my idea is we're gonna see who's the better athlete, who's the better fighter. And I can handle gambling. I've never had a gambling problem because I'm, I'm not a risk averse person. Obviously I like risks, but I'm also, I'm, I'm safe. Like I know what I'm doing even though I do dangerous things.\n\nYou've had a look at it first. Yeah. You've examined, but\n\nYou do\n\nHave, you have that ability and inclination for examination. So\n\nYou have to have that. And I feel like that's the case with alcohol. That's the case with cigarettes. I'm in favor of all those things being legal. But I know so many people that have a problem with alcohol, like cannot live without alcohol. I know so many people that can't quit smoking cigarettes. I feel like you should be able to do whatever you want to do. And I want, I want freedom. And that comes with gambling. And I, I think gambling freedom, like the ability to decide that you want to take a risk of something that should be available, but we should educate people as to like, what is actually going on in your mind that's allowing you to get captured by this thing. And now you're chasing bad money and you're in a downward spiral management. Like understanding, okay, this is a thrill, but this thrill could take over your whole life. Right. If you are maybe genetically susceptible, psychologically susceptible, like understand what it is. But I don't think we should take away cars that can go over 60 miles an hour because some people crash their cars and die. You know what I mean? Yeah. It's, I, I feel like I like that gambling exists and I always wish that it existed back in the day. I was like, it'd be fun that a hundred bucks on this or a hundred bucks on that, but I don't have the problem. Like I could see if I came from a family that was torn apart by gambling and you'd go, you know, you don't understand my dad lost our house. Like, okay, but that was a bad decision. Your, you know, your dad could have died drinking and driving and smashed into a tree. These are bad decisions. You don't have to make bad decisions just because something is tempting you. It's an interesting, it's an interesting debate because do you nanny state the whole world? Do you think gambling should be illegal? Do you think you should have to go to Vegas for it? That seems kind of crazy. I mean it's certainly not a black or white issue to me. There's a lot of gray area involved in it and I know there's a lot of people that push back on the idea of, of whether these gambling apps and all these different things should be legal and like\n\nIt's the normalization process that bothers me the most. Mm. That it's part of the new service with the apps that, that it's, but it's just put in front of you whether you're interested in it or not. You know, this team is playing that team and here's the odds. Right. And I just don't, I don't think it's healthy to have that as much of, you know, tho those stats as much a part of the actual news report as who's playing and what's on the line.\n\nThe thing about it though is it does lead you to have debate about like, here's a perfect example. Canelo Alvarez versus Terence Crawford. Terence Terence Crawford was going up two weight classes. In my mind though, he's so skillful. I gave him a chance. Right. I was like, I favor him to win. But I believe he was the underdog who was the, find out what the odds were for the Canelo Alvarez. Terence Crawford fight. I believe he was the underdog even though he was an undefeated multi division world champion. Like one of the greatest of all time for sure. But he was jumping up from the 154 pound weight class where he just won the belt. He was the 147 pound weight class all the way up to 1 68. That's a big leap. 14 pounds. And everybody thought canal's gonna have too much power. He is gonna be too big. I'm like, I don't think so. I don't think that's correct. It was odds. Is it same? Yeah. Crawford was underdog. Yeah, Crawford was the underdog. So not a huge underdog. Plus 1 35 versus plus one 40 somewhere around there. So it's not huge. Not even two to one. Not even one and a half to one. But enough where I was like, I think they're wrong. You know? So it's like, it, it fosters debate, you know, even if you're not gambling. And I didn't gamble on that fight, but I did. I was telling my friends, I got a long discussion with a good buddy of mine who's a, a real boxing connoisseur. He is like, Canelo's too big, he hits too hard. I'm like, that guy doesn't get hit. Much like, I don't think that's as big of a factor as we're thinking. I think it's a skill thing. They're not that different in size. I'm like, I don't think so. And so that odds thing is to me exciting. Like, it, it fosters debate. Like you get, you start talking about, you know, and if it's a game, you start talking about players. Like he chokes in the outfield, he does this, he does that. This guy's, he's always stealing bases. I'm factoring that in and you know, the odds become a part of the discussion. But yeah, it is ultimately the problem is, first of all, kids are addicted to apps as it is. They use them, they're always on their damn phone. And they'll go from TikTok to Instagram to to x to, you know, they're check this and then they'll check that and they'll check that and they'll check their Snapchat and then they'll check the gambling app. And then it's like, you're just addicted to this goddamn phone. So something on your phone that's also addicting. It's like addiction on top of addiction. 'cause you're already getting your little dopamine rush just by looking at your phone. And then if you're also getting a gambling rush on top of that. Yeah. We gotta educate people. Yeah. But I think we gotta educate people on social media addiction, which I think a, a giant percentage of our population is completely addicted to\n\nSocial media, probably including me. I spend large amount of every day scrolling through TikTok for some reason. And\n\nWhat do you, what's your algorithm like? What kind of stuff are you getting?\n\nI'm getting a lot of dating apps at the moment, which is really embarrassing because I'm, I'm not looking on any, I'm not on any dating apps, so I'm not sure that the algorithm is fully truthful. I think there's certain amount of things you just get fed. Right. You know, for\n\nEspecially like a dating app because that's a promotion, you know? Right. They're\n\nPromoting that. Yeah. There's a lot. Seems to be a lot coming up. But that's the problem, isn't it? Because the way the algorithm shapes it, you know, pretty much everything that comes up on your phone you have some form of interest in. Right. So that keeps you looking at, at what you're looking at. Yeah. I've got to probably gotta dial it down a little bit, but I'll be in the bush in a minute. This has been such a crazy year, man. You know, so, you know, we finished Nuremberg last year and then I went on that big tour, which is when I was here, when I came to see you the first time. But this year since between December and August I made five movies. Wow. And I was on the set of the sixth and so weary and I had no juice. I, I still feel it a little bit actually, man, you know, I've had a little bit of time off, but I've still had so many responsibilities. I kind of feel like I broke my brain or something in August. Mm. And I'm still trying to recover and I won't really recover till I get home the next time. As I was saying to you before, is when I land at home now I won't know when I'm flying out again. And that is such a relief because when you do know, when you're flying out again every day is just counting down, counting down. You might have three weeks, but it doesn't feel like three weeks. Hmm. Because you 100% know when you're leaving again. But this time I'll get home and I'll have three months and I'll be in the bush and I'll be waking up with the birds and you know, hopefully all of those things that I emptied out through the, the earlier part of the year will, will fill up again.",

Excuse me. I'm going next door.\n\nYeah. So anyway, nicotine vapes not, I don't think they're good for you folks. Sorry. 'cause people thought they were healthier for you than cigarettes. But it turns out like no, not only are they not. Yeah. Here's this look that, oh God, look he's testing all of 'em. All those cute little pink ones. He's gotta make sure they all work. By the way, how hooked is that guy? That guy must\n\nBe, that's awful.\n\nFucking hooked. Where is this taking place? I have no idea. Does it say in the, that guy has to test all of 'em.

Test his lungs. 'cause there's a thing called popcorn lung that kids are\n\nGetting. Yeah, I've heard of that.\n\nThe thing about these things is that they're, they're very, very addictive. They're more addictive than I think any other delivery method. Yeah. Like you just, and the thing about nicotine vapes is the first vape of the day is the only one you really want. The first vape of the day. I would take a vape and be like, this is wonderful. Like, this feeling is wonderful. It's wonderful. And then you chase that dragon and you never get it back until the next day. Yeah. The rest of the day you're sucking on this thing going,\n\nYeah,\n\nNope, nothing. And then I'm not getting it. I'm not getting that wonderful feeling. Yeah. You have to have no nicotine in your system. And then you have that one hint. It's like welcoming into your life.\n\nDo you get like, do these people get like that feeling from those patches?\n\nI don't think so. I think the patches just make you\n\nLike a little Adderall.\n\nYeah. It's like pe I'm sure people have Adderall patches, don't they? Do they have an Adderall patch? I don't think so. No. Adderall's a sketchy one. I had some in here the other day that was telling me they were doing Adderall right before I want, I did an Adderall just so I'm ready.\n\nLike it's like it's a writing. It's very helpful for writing. Oh I'm sure. It's like you don't want to have, I don't want to need it. So that's why I was, was like, what brain thing's gonna take? Yeah. What are loosies?\n\nWhat does it say? Jamie? Oh, amphetamine patch. There it is. Oh sure. Are a DHD treatment that lets you control your time your way. They always say that. Like, look, this is a, a woman who's in control. Look at her with her jean jacket on her arms crossed. I am in control. She's got a control posture. Look at her posture. I'm on a meth patch. I'm in control.\n\nA meth patch. Please Lord. No,\n\nYou are literally on a drug that will kill your superpower. You got a superpower and you're killing it with a drug. So you could\n\nFocus on I definitely don't want a patch of that.\n\nYeah, no thanks. I'm scared. No thanks. I don't need it. Hard pass. Maybe. Maybe somebody needs it. I don't wanna judge. But the reality is that stuff, the, the amphetamines in any shape or form are highly addictive. Yeah. And they're passing 'em out like candy. Yeah. My daughter's in high school and a bunch of kids in high school have air quotes. A DHD. And because of a DHD they get Adderall. And then also they get more time on tests because they got a DH, adhd. They can't focus. So they're fucking on speed\n\nTricks of the train and they get\n\nMore. Yeah. And so because it's very competitive. Yeah. Parents want to get their kids into colleges. They're, they're, you know, getting their kids diagnosed so they can get their kid hooked on whatever. They're probably already hooked on too. 'cause a lot of people that are adults are hooked on it. Yeah. And you can tell those folks 'cause they come to the, the parent teacher meetings and they can't shut the fuck up and they just wanna talk to you about everything. Oh my God. They wanna corner me and ask me about some episode. I did. Oh my god. I love that episode that you did with the kind about climate\n\nYour eyes.\n\nThey're so cracked out. They're so obviously cracked out and there's a lot of people out there just running around cracked out be, but they feel like they got it from the doctor. The doctor gave me this, I'll tell you that. 30 milligrams and I'm just a better person. I think it's better about all tasks. I I'm\n\nActually my, I like talk to that person daily. Like I feel like I, those people are everywhere. They're\n\nEverywhere. Yeah. Well we looked it up. Use perplexity, which is one of our sponsors, and find out how many prescriptions for Adderall they wrote in let's say 2024. Let's take a guess. How many\n\nDo you think? Ooh. I mean, I could not even ballpark that.\n\nI wanna say 40 million. I bet it's 40 million prescriptions at least. It's probably a lot more. But I'm going conservative and I'm saying 40 million prescriptions for Adderall in 2024. What do you want? You wanna guess? Yeah, take\n\nA guess. 40. I say 51.\n\n51. You're probably closer. I bet it's like 90. I bet it's nuts. I hope it's not. I bet it's because it's like individual people refilling prescriptions. You know, I don't think it's like 90 million patients. I be It's a lot. I bet it's all journalists. I feel like most people that are writing things this Yeah, I bet that in. What is it? Okay. How many Adderall prescriptions were written in 2024? According to Perplex? 45 million Adderall prescriptions written in the United States. Well we were both in the middle. Yeah. You what'd you go? 51. Yeah. I said 40 commonly prescribed stimulants for conditions such as a DHD and narcolepsy. This number falls several years of notable growth. Huh? It's weird. Are more people need it?\n\nIt's up since 2019.\n\nLook at that. Yeah. Notable growth data suggests the prescription rates begin to decline slightly after a, a sharp surge during the COVID-19 pandemic and shortages affected, I'll stop. Hold on. 2019 it was only 35. Interesting. So it's up 10 million. Who? That's crazy. 41.4 million in 2021 and 45 million by 2023. I bet there's a lot of people getting it illegally too. Like what's that number? Okay. Let's, that's 'cause you, there was that shortage and Right. Know if they've covered, recovered from it. Well also, once the shortage started, people got dealers. Sure.\n\nBut people are using mushrooms and stuff for that now too.\n\nThat's a very different thing though.\n\nI've heard, I've heard a lot about that.\n\nYeah. Microdosing mushrooms is a, that's a very different thing than Adderall. Yeah. That's like the opposite of Adderall.\n\nYeah. Even if it's for focus. Mm. Right. Like\n\nWell I'm sure it'll help. Your focus\n\nIs on something.\n\nYeah. But you gotta be, you gotta mine your P's and Qs when it comes to your dosages also. Like where are you getting that?\n\nThat's just scary for me. Like, I'm like, where is it from? Like, did you just go to the cow pasture? 'cause that's like what teenagers did when I heard they were doing mushrooms. Like they were like cow tipping and going, you know, from East Texas. So Yeah.\n\nWell they definitely found him growing on poop. I mean that's how all humans originally probably discovered psilocybin. They found him on cow poop. Yeah. But the thing about that though is like, you gotta get 'em from somebody who knows what they're doing. Yeah. Because there's, they're all different and you can get some that are crazy strong. Like there's some out there that'll knock you into another universe. So what are you doing? Are you just eating a cap? Are you paying attention to the, are you getting them in pill form? Who are you getting them from? Like I have a friend who,\n\nThey're all my questions too\n\nGets them from a friend. And I was like, who you who?\n\nIt's a good friend\n\nGuy. Who's the guy that you, you not seen these things get packaged, get the fuck outta here.\n\nIt's a little, little shady. Super\n\nSketch. Yep. Super sketch. Yep. And they're, they all, it's like marijuana edibles before the, the legality in California when it was medical they'd be, it was crazy because now they, they, because of the regulations in California, I think the most they could make 'em is 10 milligrams. Which is normal. Yeah. It's a normal dose. But before that, when it was medical, like it became medical in the nineties, they would make 500 milligram Chiba. These, these things that like they're 500 milligrams, which is insane. It puts you in another dimension\n\nThat's, I never even heard of that.\n\nThey're so strong. And my friend Joey, who's a real demon, Joey used to take the wrapper off of 25 milligram ones and give people a 500 milligram one instead.\n\nOh. He throw a, a real demon\n\nAnd he would just laugh because he can, he could tolerate insane doses. So he would give people like preposterous amounts.\n\nI have a songwriter friend and I love her dearly, but whatever she says, do this. I'm like, do a quarter of that, whatever that is to the public. Do yourself a surface. Do a quarter of that.\n\nSome people have ridiculous tolerances\n\nFor marijuana. Yeah. I mean it's crazy. Yeah.\n\nFor anything.\n\nI'm just over here taking a Lucy from a random dude.\n\nWell it's only four milligrams. I'm kidding. It's minor. It wasn't that bad. Right. I would never like the nine. I would've told you like, spit that quick.\n\nThat's\n\nA lot. Real quick. It's a lot. Yeah, it's a lot. I have twelves.\n\nWhat do you do? You use those for real busy days?\n\nI don't like 'em. They, they jolt me too much. But I have them. This is just 'cause Lucy sent them to me, but I think the right dose is three or four. That's right. You guys just a little pick me up just a little.\n\nNot the cracked out. Not the cracked out. Cracked soccer\n\nMom crack. Yeah. Not the cracked out. Not add. I've never tried Adderall. I've, I'm scared of it. I want to try it one day because I'm scared of it. 'cause I'm like, I need to know what everybody's fussing about because everybody I know that's tried it is like, don't try it. You'll love it.\n\nYou'll love it. You'll fucking love it. It is focus. Yeah. I mean it is, it really hones hones in. I have a\n\nBuddy of mine and his wife told him to stop 'cause he was snorting it 'cause he was writing. That's\n\nInsane.\n\nHe is like, that's the best way to get it real quick. He, and he was like, to his wife, he was like, why do you care how I do it? She's like, you are snorting drugs while the kids are asleep. He's like, okay.\n\nYeah, it's a little far, dude. Slow your roll.\n\nHe's not an addict though. He just, he just felt like he's\n\nNot an addict though. He's not an addict.\n\nHe felt like he had to snort to really get the most outta it, it quickly.\n\nWell everybody, like you said, everybody's trying to find something like,\n\nBecause I think if you take it as a pill, it probably takes like an hour before it kicks in and he didn't have an hour. So he is like,\n\nI have a deadline. Yeah. Does your friend that disappears, does he like, have he doesn't have phone, no digital. Nothing. No. Nothing.\n\nNo.\n\nI wonder if that digital detox is like one of the hardest ones. I feel like\n\nIt's gotta be the hardest. Yeah. I've done social media detoxes for multiple days and you genuinely feel better. Yeah. And then you go, why am I doing this to myself? Or I don't do this.\n\nI know all the time. Something that's annoying. If I can just say it is that like, when people do take a break from social media, that's like all they tell you about the whole time. Well, I'm on a break from social media. I'm like, yes. Can you be on a break with broke without telling anybody that you're on a break from social media. Right.\n\nThey have to tell you how virtuous they are. God, I am actually gonna break of social media unlike you. I'm\n\nLike, cool bro.\n\nYou you little addict scrolling through cat videos.\n\nDoom scrolling.\n\nYeah. There's a lot of doom scrolling. Yeah. It's like people who do yoga, they can't shut the fuck up about it.\n\nYeah. It's like a lot of things. Or people with like a special, a special like a special diet. Like oh yeah, carnivore. Oh, you're hearing about it. Carnivore. You're hearing about it.\n\nVegans are the worst.\n\nYou're gonna hear about it. They're the absolute worst. Like,\n\nLike no one has ever met a vegan that didn't tell them they're vegan. It doesn't happen. They\n\nAlways tell you never. Not like that. They working\n\nInto a conversation eventually.
