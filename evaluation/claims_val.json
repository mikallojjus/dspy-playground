      "transcript_chunk": "e changed his mind at the very last moment. It was on him and now is the Congress's responsibility. But they passed that responsibility to him with their unconstitutional authorization that they passed in October of 2002. But like ultimately, who pulled that trigger? George W. Bush did. And in conspiracy with his vice president and his Secretary of Defense and the rest of them. So the neocons, yes, they were the Deputy Secretary of Defense and the Deputy Secretary of Defense for policy. And the, you know, staff in the Vice President's office, the staff of the National Security Council, they were there operating really, as I said, as that, as Colin Powell called it, that separate government and operating mostly for Benjamin Netanyahu's goals.\n\nAnd this is part of what we argued about me and Mark Dubowitz on your show last time was he insisted somewhat, partially, correctly here, that Ariel Sharon wanted Bush to hit Iran, not Iraq. And Ariel Sharon, not Netanyahu was the prime minister. And that was the occasion of him accusing JJ Goldberg of being an antisemite because he had written in the Jewish Daily Forward about how Netanyahu wants to hit Iraq. Sharon would rather hit Iran and JJ Goldberg, as long as I'm citing him, let me tell you, he says in there very clearly that he is not saying that the neocons bear, even the lion's share of the responsibility for the war.\n\nOf course, he blames George W. Bush for launching the war. And of course he's not pedaling in some anti-Semitic conspiracy theory and the pages of the fore for God's sake. Right? He's, he's extremely conservative in his statements and in his accusations. But what he's saying is that the Likud Nixons in America are closer to Netanyahu than Sharon. And of course, George W. Bush wants to Go to Iraq, he wants to Go to Baghdad, not Tavon. And so it, and and Wolfowitz of course, always especially was an Iraq hawk. And so the confluence of interest here was to Go to Iraq. Now Sharon was smart enough to see that Iran, you know, the clean break wasn't him.\n\nThat was Netanyahu. And his buddies, Sharon, I think was skeptical about what's gonna happen when we, we overthrow Saddam Hussein and the Shiites takeover. And this is where he tried to insist and John Bolton did echo him in this and promise him that, yes. And then we'll Go to Iran and Syria and Lebanon and everywhere else next because we can't just get rid of Saddam. And that's gonna change the balance of power in a way that's gonna benefit Iran in a way that Sharon did not prefer. However, Sharon absolutely did go along with the program and help lie us into war. And he had his own office of special plans that he created in the, the Prime Minister's office in Israel where they manufactured fake intelligence in English to stove pipe into the intelligence stream to help lie us into war.\n\nAnd here's three authoritative sources on that. Julian Borger in the Guardian, the spies who pushed for war. And it's not the spies, it's the neo-conservatives, it's who he's talking about. Not CIA officers, the spies who pushed for war by Julian Borger. Then there's more missing intelligence by Robert Dreyfuss in the nation then is a pretext for War nine 11 Iraq and the abuse of America's intelligence agencies by James Bamford, the great book by the great James Bamford, the guy that wrote the puzzle, palace and Body of Secrets and the Shadow Factory about the National Security Agency. Best author on the NSA Pretext for War focuses on the neocons and the CIA and how the neocons led us into war for Netanyahu and, and Israel.\n\nI don't remember. Oh, and the whole first part is about nine 11 and how nine 11 happened and how the government failed to stop it. And then the shadow factor is really insightful on those lines because we often hear about the infighting between the FBI and the CIA. But the NSA also hoarded all their information and would not share with the FBI or CIA and the CIA at one point. And, and Michael Scheuer also tells the story. CI had to create their own listening station on Madagascar to try to spy on Al-Qaeda hiding out in Yemen, the switchboard house in Yemen because the NSA would not give them the intercepts. They had to get their own, but they could only get half the conversation and not the other half talking to the terrorists in Afghanistan. And as Sawyer put it to me on my show, I don't know, 15 years ago or something, he said, yeah, 'cause George Tenet didn't have the moral courage to just walk down there and demand the damn intercept.\n\n'cause at that time, the head of the CIA was also the director of Central Intelligence, which meant the boss like the DNI is supposed to be over all the other intelligence agencies. So George Tenet had the authority to command NSA to do what he said. He didn't have to ask nicely, but according to Sawyer, he didn't have the courage to just go down there and say, gimme the damn intercept. Why not scumbag? You know, he came from staff in the Senate, I think, just wanted to please the real spies, you know, like he was kind of the new kind didn't really fit in and was trying to like be cool or whatever. And I don't know who knows these people, but so importantly, you know, the aerial Shaone government did help to push this thing, even though Dubowitz is right, that Shaone said, no Bush, you should Go to Tehran first because that was his problem.\n\nIt was, I guess, I don't know if I'd have to go back and and see if anybody ever wrote about this, but I never saw like Sharon's opinion of the clean break. But it's easy to see how anyone could see through how stupid the plan was. We're gonna weaken the Shiites by getting rid of the most powerful Sunnis standing in their way. That's pretty dumb, right? And especially if you really know about, for example, the history of the Iran Iraq War, the history of the post Iraq War one Shiite uprising, you might have real reason to worry. Justin Raimondo at anti-war dot com wrote in 2002. He said, Hey, look, everybody, the Supreme Council for Islamic Revolution in Iraq, the CIA, tried to give them money. And they said, piss off, we don't need you. We got Iran.\n\nAnd Justin said, better watch out. Here's who's coming to power when we invaded Iraq a year from now. And then that's exactly what happened, is the, the again, the bo a brigade was the militia of the Supreme Council for Islamic Revolution in Iraq. And that was exactly who George W. Bush took all the way to power in Baghdad. So for the guys who fought in that war who are listening to this, who still don't know why they fought in that war, ultimately they fought on the Shiite side of a massive civil war against the minority Sunni ruling regime. And to replace them with a new, essentially Islamist theocracy sort of pseudo republic like in Iran. And that that's what it was for.\n\nIt's not for freedom, it was for one faction over the other. And in this case it was the Shiites. And then of course, the most powerful fact, it's worth explaining, not of course, that the most powerful Shia groups that came together to form the new Iraqi government was the Supreme Council for Islamic Revolution in Iraq, skii, which is now called Isky, because we won their revolution for them. So now it's just the Islamic Supreme Council of Iraq, the Dawa Party, and Ada Al Solder and his Maori army. Now Dawa and Skii had been living in Iran and they were kind of more higher class types, whereas Tda Al Solder is like the son of important guys.\n\nIt was much more like a street Rian type. And the ghetto, the Shiite ghetto in Eastern Baghdad was called Saddam City. As soon as America invaded, they renamed it solder city after his father. But he inherited a lot of that street credibility as like the, the most legitimate of the Shiite leaders on the ground there. So these three groups under the guidance of the Ayatollah Ali Alani, who lived down in Naja under his leadership or guidance or whatever, they formed what was called the United Iraqi Alliance. That was the group that wrote the Constitution in the fall of 2004. That was the group that won the elections, the big purple fingered elections of 2005.\n\nAnd that's what kicked off the Real Civil War started after that. Now, there was already a predominantly SUNY based insurgency at that time. It was not exclusively suny, it started out much more nationalist and mixed. But very quickly it was the Sunni tribal leaders and former bist and and military leaders realizing that they have everything to lose now, and that they have the super majority of the country backed by the United States is now taking power. And then, so this pushed the Sunnis into the arms, the SUNY insurgency into the arms of the Bin Laden knights who were coming from all over the place, just like it was Afghanistan, War Bosnia, or Cheney again, or Kosovo coming to all chip in to fight the Holy Jihad this time against us instead of with our help, although still backed by our friends, the Saudis.\n\nAnd they came in there and America and the Shiites pushed the SUNY insurgency into the arms of the Bin Laden knights. And in fact, I'll tell you an anecdote about how that happened. And so much of this is tied up and what's happening in Israel at this time as well. In January of 2004, Sheik Yasin, who was the founder of Hamas, which was a break off of the Muslim Brotherhood, it was originally like a charitable type organization that ended up growing into this militia with the aid and comfort of the Israelis. And there's some really great articles that you might like to peruse about this, including by Richard Sale in UPI.\n\nIf you just type in Richard Sale, UPI, Hamas, I'm sure it'll just come straight up there. Israel gave major aid to Hamas. This is an in-depth study. It's based on CIA as well as Shin Bet and Mossad Sources Richard Sale. If people aren't familiar, UPI is the news agency most closely tied to the Washington Times, which would be the Reaganite conservative newspaper in Washington. It's funny 'cause it's the Washington Post and the New York Times are the liberal papers and the New York Post and the Washington Times are the conservative papers, if you got that right. So, so\n\nBasically this, this article details how Tel Aviv Israel gave direct and indirect financial aid to Hamas over a period of many years,\n\nMany years. And the purpose was to build them up to divide and conquer the Palestinians, to create a religious right wing alternative to the secular nationalist sort of pseudo PLO. Under Yaser Arafat, they wanted to divide and conquer the Palestinians. And so what they would do is they would finance directly finance Hamas, while at the same time arresting all of their competitors and holding them in prison, disarming them, weakening them while bolstering the Hamas government. So they did not create Hamas, but they did very deliberately bolster its rise. Now Hezbollah is a different story where Hezbollah just really grew up in reaction to their invasion of Lebanon in 82 without any direct support from them in that sense, although maybe I don't know enough about that, but certainly in this case with Demas, that's true.\n\nAnd you can also read Andrew Higgins in the Wall Street Journal wrote a great piece along the same lines. Wanna pull that up for his name. How is Joe help to spawn Hamas, Andrew Higgins 2009? So I can also recommend Robert Dreyfuss book Devil's Game, how the United States helped to unleash Fundamentalist Islam Masterpiece. Also, again, treat a Parsi treacherous alliance. Cannot recommend that book highly enough. That thing might go into its third printing Just 'cause of Me. I'm telling you, everybody's gotta read that book. And then Obstacle to Peace by Libertarian Institute, fellow Jeremy R. Hammond wrote a masterpiece about Israel and Palestine and the fight over the occupied territories in America's role in making it all worse than the rest.\n\nFantastic book goes in deep study about this. Now, back tomorrow, our anecdote in January of 2004, oik with his big Santa Claus beard and his wheelchair says, I give up, I give in. We need to go ahead and negotiate with the Israelis and settle for our measly stinking 22% of historic Palestine. Just as Arafat had done in 19 88, 2 months later, the Israelis killed him in a missile strike, just so they could lie to you Lex, and say, we have no partner for peace. Somehow a missile blew up his car and they're the ones who killed him. And when they killed him in March of 2004, that's what touched off the riot in Fallujah, where the four black water guards were murdered and burned and their bodies hanged from the bridge outside of town.\n\nAnd they had a giant parade. Dar Jamil, the Great war journalist, was there and saw they had pictures of Yasin in their windshields. They called themselves the Yasin brigades. And it was this impromptu protest against Israel's murder of the leader of Hamas. And that's what caused that riot that killed those black water guards. And then George W. Bush sent General James Madison there with his marines, including now a couple of friends of mine who had to go in there and bite that thing and declared the thing a free fire zone like Vietnam and killed hundreds if not thousands of innocent civilians in the first battle of Fallujah, which they claim that z the Bin Laden night, who wasn't even really Bin Laden night. Yet he didn't declare his loyalty to Bin Laden until the end of 2004, a year and a half into the war.\n\nBut they pretended so six months later, but they pretended that he was already tied to Bin Laden. He was one of the lies in, in Colin Powell's un speech that there's this guy named Au and he's tied to Bin Laden and he's tied to Saddam. Well, he wasn't tied to Bin Laden, he had told Bin Laden, no, I don't wanna join your group. And he wasn't tied to Saddam, unlike the lies of Ahmed Chalabi and the exiles. He was not operated on by Saddam Hussein and given a peg leg in the Baghdad hospital, that was a hoax perpetrated by the weekly standard in the neoconservative set to tie those two together. In fact, he wasn't tied to either. And then only after the war, an America made him famous and claimed that he was Bin Laden. Did Sar raised in stature.\n\nSarka was like more apocalyptic and revolutionary and, and even nihilistic and destructive than bin Laden's doctrines ever were. And he was notoriously sectarian against the Shiites where Bin Laden, you know, I don't think, and, and I have not read everything the guy ever wrote, but I have read a lot of his stuff and I never saw where he really seems to focus on problems against the Shiites. Again, Muhammad Atta and Ramsey Binal, they were mad because of Shimon Perez and Naftali Bennett killing Shiite Palestinians in Lebanon. The fact that they were Shiites didn't make them less valuable as far as wanting to avenge their deaths as far as that goes.\n\nSar on the other hand thought, no, the only good Shiite is a dead Shiite. God says so. And this kind of like cra bring on the apocalypse kind of deal and went for, you know, madness, suicide bombing Shiite pilgrims and doing like just absolute atrocities against civilians. Which of course, like the guy may be good at making bomb vests, but he's not good at math because there's just way too many Shiites. And so by boycotting the election, refusing to participate in the new order, which they got the American superpower occupying the country with 300,000 troops, or at that point maybe 200,000, but still, and in alliance with the super majority, those Sunni chiefs should have figured out a way to deal saying, no way, let's Fight was a huge mistake from them.\n\nAnd then entering into alliance with the Bin Laden knights only made it worse because, and this is, it is directly because of Israel killing Yasin. And then the Battle of Fallujah that helped drive a bunch of refugees out of Fallujah who then went to Baghdad, who drove people outta their areas. And then you had a lot of tit tit for tat back and forth is refugees from the different cities are being cleansed out.",

      "transcript_chunk": "es the complete opposite. No, we want the full expression that fits different human brains such that it seems like the language is guessing just what they want.\n\nAnd part of that is also you described the principle of Lisa Prize, which is a difficult thing to engineer into a language because you have to kind of, it's a subjective thing. What is,\n\nWhich is why you can't do it in one way, which is why I used the example of both Exit and Quit. The principle of Lisa Surprise for some people would be like, oh, exit. That's how I get out of the prompt. For other people it'd be quit. Why don't we just do both?\n\nOkay, so what's the convention over configuration? That's a big one.\n\nThat's a big one. That's a huge one. And it was born out of a frustration I had in the early days with especially Java frameworks, where when you were setting up a web application framework for Java back in the day, it was not uncommon to literally write hundreds if not thousands of lines of XML configuration files. Oh, I need this, I want the database to use the foreign keys as Post id. No, no, no. I wanted As post capital ID, oh, no, no, no, you have to do it. Capital PID. There are all these ways where you can configure how foreign relation keys should work in a database and none of them matter. We just need to pick one and then that's fine.\n\nAnd if we pick one and we can depend on it, it becomes a convention. And if it's a convention, we don't have to configure it. And if we don't have to configure it, you can get started with you actually care about much quicker. So convention of Configuration is essentially to take that idea that the system should come preassembled. I'm not just handing you a box of fucking Legos and asking you to build the Millennium Falcon. I'm giving you a finished toy. You can edit, you can change it, it's still build out a Legos. You can still take some pieces off and put in some other pieces, but I'm giving you the final product. And this cuts against the grain of what most programmers love. They love a box of Legos. They love to put everything together from scratch. They love to make all these detailed little decisions that just don't matter at all.\n\nAnd I want to elevate that up such that, hey, I'm not trying to take the decisions away from you, I just want you to focus on decisions that actually matter that you truly care about. No one cares about whether it's post under ID or Post ID or Pit.\n\nYeah, great. Defaults,\n\nYes.\n\nIt's just a wonderful thing. You have all these aspirations, they're gonna do some kind of custom, most beautiful Legos castle that nobody's ever built from these pieces. But in reality, to be productive in most situations, you just need to build the basic thing and and then on top of that is where your creativity comes.\n\nAbsolutely. And I think this is one of those, part of the doctrine that a lot of programmers who get to use Ruby on Rails, begrudgingly will acknowledge it's a nice thing, even if they don't really like it, like it's hard to beat the sort of attraction to building with Legos from scratch out of programmers. That's just what we like. This is why we're programmers in the first place because we'd like to put these little pieces together, but we can direct that instinct towards a more productive end of the stack. Okay.\n\nWhat are some of the other ones?\n\nThe menu is on casa. It actually comes out of the same principle that great defaults really matter. If you look at everything that's wrong with the JavaScript ecosystem right now, for example, it is that no one is in charge of the menu. There are a billion different dishes and you can configure just your tailored specific configuration of it, but no one done the work to make sure it all fits together. So you have all these unique problems in the JavaScript ecosystem, for example, there's probably 25 major ways of just doing the controller layer and then as many of how to talk to the database. So you get this permutation of end times, end times n of no one is using the same thing.\n\nAnd if they are using the same thing, they're only using the same thing for about five minutes. So we have no retained wisdom. We build up no durable skills. Rails goes the complete opposite way of saying, do you know what Rails is not just a framework, it is a complete attempt at solving the web problem. It's complete attempt at solving everything you need to build a great web application. And every piece of that puzzle should ideally be in the box pre-configured, preassembled. If you wanna change some of those pieces later, that's wonderful, but on day one you'll get a full menu designed by a chef who really cared about every piece of the ingredient and you're gonna enjoy it.\n\nAnd that's again, one of those things where many programmers think like I know better, and they do in some hyper local sense of it. Every programmer knows better. This is what Ruby is built on, that every programmer knows better in their specific situation. Maybe they can do something dangerous, maybe they think they know better and then they blow their foot off and then they truly will know better because they've blown their foot off once and won't do it again. But the the menu is a macas. Is that so\n\nYou in general see the value in the In the monolith?\n\nYes. The integrated system. Integrated system that someone thought of the whole problem. This is one of the reasons why I've been on a crusade against microservices since the term was coined. Microservices was born out of essentially a good idea. What do you do at Netflix scale when you have thousands of engineers working on millions of lines of code? No one can keep that entire system in their head at one time. You have to break it down. Microservices can be a reasonable way to do that when you're at Netflix scale, when you apply that pattern to a team of 20 programmers working on a code base of half a million lines of code, you're an idiot. You just don't need turn invocation into network calls it the first rule of distributed programming, do not distribute your programming.\n\nIt is makes everything harder. All the failure conditions you have to consider as a programmer just becomes infinitely harder when there's a network cable involved. So I hate the idea of premature decomposition and microservices is exactly that. The monolith says, let's try to focus on building a whole system that a single human can actually understand and push that paradigm as far as possible by compressing all the concepts. Just that more of it will fit into memory of a single operating human. And then we can have a system where I can actually understand all of base camp. I can actually understand all of hay. Both of those systems are just over a hundred thousand lines of code. I've seen people do this that maybe twice, maybe three times that scale and then it starts breaking down once you get north of certainly half a million lines of code.\n\nNo individual human can do it, and that's when you get into maybe some degree of microservices can make sense.\n\nBasecamp and Hay are both a hundred\n\nThousand, a hundred thousand lines of code thereabouts.\n\nWow, that's small.\n\nIt's considering the fact that Basecamp, I think has something like 420 screens, different ways and configurations even.\n\nDo you include the front end in that?\n\nNo, that's the Ruby code. Well, it's front end in the sense that some of that Ruby Codes, it's beneficial to the to the front, but it's not JavaScript for example. Now the other thing we might talk about later is we write very little JavaScript actually for all of our applications. Hey, which is a Gmail competitor. Gmail ships, I think 28 megabytes of uncompressed JavaScript. If you compress it, I think think it's about six megabytes, 28 megabytes. Think about how many lines of code that is. When Hay launched, we shipped 40 kilobytes.\n\nYeah,\n\nIt's trying to solve the same problem. You can solve the email client problem with either 28 megabytes of uncompressed JavaScript or with 40 kilobytes if you do things differently. Yeah, but that comes through the same problem essentially. This is why I have fiercely fought splitting front end and back end. Apart that, in my opinion, this was one of the great crimes against web development. Yeah. That we are still atoning for that we separated and divided what was and should be a unified problem solving mechanism. When you are working both on front end and backend, you understand the whole system and you're not going to get into these camps that decompose and eventually you end up with shit like GraphQL.\n\nOkay, let's fly through the rest of the doctrine. No one paradigm,\n\nNo one paradigm goes to the fact that Ruby is a fiercely object-oriented programming language at its core, but it's also a functional program language. This five times I told you about, you can essentially do these anonymous function calls and you can chain 'em together very much in the spirit of how true functional programming languages work. Ruby has even moved closer towards the functional programming and of the scale by making strings immutable. There are ideas from all different disciplines of, and all different paradigms of software development that can fit together. Small talk, for example, was only object oriented and that was just it. Ruby tries to be mainly object oriented, but borrow a little bit of functional programming, a little bit of imperative programming, be able to do all of that.\n\nRails tries to do the same thing. We're not just gonna pick one paradigm and run it through everything. Object orientation is at the center of it, but it's okay to invite all these other disciplines and it's okay to be inspired. It's okay to remix it. I actually think one of the main benefits of Rails is that it's a remix. I didn't invent all these ideas. I didn't come up with active record. I didn't come up with the NBC way of dividing an application. I took all the great ideas that I had learned and picked up from every different camp and I put it together not because there was gonna be just one single overarching theory of everything, but I was gonna have a cohesive unit that incorporated the best from everywhere.\n\nIs that idea a bit a tension with the beauty of the monolith system?\n\nI think the monolith can be thought of as quite roomy, quite as a big tent that the monolith needs actually to borrow a little bit of functional programming for the kinds of problems that that excels, that discipline excels at solving and that paradigm excels at solving. If you also want object orientation at its core, I actually think when I've looked at functional programming languages, there's a lot to love. And then I see some of the crazy contortions they have to go through when part of the problem they're solving calls for mutating something and you go like, holy shit, this is a great paradigm from 90% of the problem.\n\nAnd then you're twisting yourself completely outta shape when you try to solve the last 10. Ooh,\n\nExalt Beautiful code is the next one.\n\nWe've talked about that at length and here's a great example that really summarizes the domain specific language quality of Ruby on Rails that you can make code actually pleasant to write and read. Which is really funny to me because as we talked about when I started learning programming, it wasn't even a consideration. I didn't even know that that could be part of the premise, that that could be part of the solution. That writing code could feel as good as writing a poem\n\nClass project, application record belongs to account has many participants. Class name person validates presence of name.\n\nSee, you could read it out. You didn't even change\n\nAnything. It's like a haiku or something, right?\n\nIsn't that beautiful? Yeah,\n\nIt's nice. It's really, it's really, it's really nice. There's a, there's an intuitive nature to it. Okay, so I have specific questions there. I mean active record, just to take that tangent, that has to be your favorite feature.\n\nIt's the crown jewel of rails. It really is. It's the defining characteristic of how to work with Ruby on Rails. Yeah, and it's born in an interesting level of controversy because it actually uses a pattern that had been described by Martin Fowler in the patterns of enterprise application architecture. One of the greatest books for anyone working on business systems. And if you had not read it, you must pick it up immediately. Patterns of enterprise application architecture, I think it was published in 2001. It is one of the very few programming books that I have read many times over. It's incredible in it. Martin describes a bunch of different patterns of how to build business systems essentially.\n\nAnd active record is a little bit of a footnote in there. The pattern is literally called active record. You can look it up in this Nice, it's called Active. Very good. I wasn't even creative enough to come up with a name of my own. But it allows the creation, the marriage of database and object orientation in a way that a lot of programmers find a little off-putting. They don't actually want to pollute the beautiful object-oriented nature of that kind of programming with sql. There was a rant by Uncle Bob the other day about how SQL is the worst thing ever, blah blah. Ah, okay, fine, whatever. I don't care. This is practical. We are making CRUD applications.\n\nYou're taking things out of an HCML form and you're sticking 'em into a damn database. It's not more complicated than that. The more abstractions you put in between those two ends of the spectrum, the more you're just fooling yourself. This is what we're doing. We're talking to SQL databases. By the way, quick aside, SQL was one of those things that have endured the onslaught of no SQL databases structured list data for a better part of a decade and still reign Supreme SQL was a good thing to invest your time in learning. Every program I'm working with the web should know SQL to a fair degree. Even if they're working with an ORM, an object relational map or as active record, you still need to understand sql.\n\nWhat Active Record does is not so much try to abstract the SQL away behind a different kind of paradigm. It's just making it less cumbersome to write, making it more amenable to build domain models on top of other domain models in ways that you don't have to write every damn sequel statement by hand. We'll just\n\nSay the active record is an ORM. Yes. Which is a layer that makes it intuitive and human interpretable to communicate with a database\n\nEven simpler than that. It turns tables into classes and rows into objects. I actually think SQL is very easy to understand Most of it. You can write some SQL golf too. That's very hard to understand. But SQL at its base, and much of the criticism against SQL was it was written for human consumption. It's actually quite verbose, especially if you're doing things like inserts over and over again. It's quite ose insert into table parentheses, enumerate every column you want to insert values, parentheses, every value that fits with that column. It gets tedious to write sequel by hand, but it's actually very humanly readable. Active record just takes that tediousness away.\n\nIt makes it possible to combine things in a way that a humanly describable language just doesn't. It composes things into methods and you can combine these methods and you can build structures around them. So I don't dislike sql, I dislike a lot of things in programming. I try to get rid of them. SQL wasn't really one of them, it was just a sense of I don't wanna write the same thing over and over again. It was a, can we be a little more succinct? Can we match it just slightly better to the object orientation without trying to hide away the fact that we're persisting these objects into a database. That's where I think a lot of ORMs went wrong. They tried to live in the pure world of objects, never to consider that.\n\nThose objects had to be consistent into a SQL database.",

      "transcript_chunk": "l, is that it's a very humane place in a lot of ways. The funding is not what it was. Let's get that straight right now in England, anywhere the arts are underfunded. It's bad it everywhere.\n\nAlthough here there's much more from the state,\n\nMuch, much more. And I'm sure that's going to be more pronounced once we lose, you know, our National Endowment of the arts, which will probably happen very soon in America. So that's absolutely true. I think there's a theater culture here that does not exist in America in general. There's a certain kind of value placed on the arts in England. And that is the thing about this tradition, right? We're part of a history. This is part of how we do things. It's very codified and there's constricting elements of that and then there's very wonderful elements to it. So you really do feel that that theater going is part of our culture. And that's why like, you know, in the royal court, they have seats in the bleachers for like 10 pence so everyone can come. 'cause it's part of the democracy that is part of the democracy.\n\nThat's how the Greeks thought of it as well.\n\nI thought of you and this play the other day we were up in Chester, England. It's an old Roman city. They've still got intact Roman walls and there's a thousand year old cathedral. And while we were there, we went to the races. The oldest horse racing track in the world is there. It's almost 500 years old. It's fun. And it's also weirdly identical to what it must have been almost 500 years ago. You've got animals, you've got people on them. And other than like the hats that the ladies wear, they call fascinators them being made of things that I'm sure materials that didn't exist 500 years ago. Otherwise it's pretty much the same. I was thinking that that's a tradition that carries on.\n\nMaybe it's because it's a form of entertainment where you can also bet, but it's social. Right? People get together in the sunshine you drink. And I was thinking about, well theater, you know, the same time that Chester was happening, like Shakespeare probably went to the Chester race course at some point, right? And I'm just thinking about the trajectories of these two things in some ways are very similar. They're analog things that are events. But the theater, sadly to me, and I gather to you as what would seem to be a different trajectory going forward, what do you think is lost for humankind?\n\nOh my God, listen, I'm a playwright, so clearly I like it. I think there are a lot of bad plays. I think it's a very hard medium. I think some of the curators are a little bit boring. But I think in terms of people getting together in a shared space and having a collective experience, it can be breathtakingly beautiful and important. And you know, again, I go back to the earliest democracies. I mean, it was a democratic requirement to go to the theater in ancient Greece, not for women. 'cause they weren't considered people or slaves, but still, okay. There was this idea that theater and democracy, they go together\n\nAnd the theater was often about the ideas of the day. It wasn't pure entertainment, we should say. Yes. Yeah,\n\nThere were ideas of the day, but then it was also, who knows? People were stabbing each other and killing the sheep and going crazy. I guess those are the ideas of the day. We're all going mad. But you know, there was a kind of psychic penetration that those plays engaged. There was a shadow side of human behavior and what it meant to be part of a social contract and also to be a leader of some kind or to be disenfranchised. Those are the plays that really move and interest me. Sometimes we go into phases of history where boulevard plays, I guess they're called, that are just lovely and entertaining and kind of throwaway, but fine in the moment, become more the order of the day.\n\nAnd then I think there are moments in history where the work can get more difficult.\n\nSpeaking of work that can be difficult. The street that we're on today, old Compton in soho, central London. Do you happen to know anything about who lived on the street in the past?\n\nGay people?\n\nI'm guessing that.\n\nThat's all I know. It's like a gay\n\nArea. Yeah, I'm guessing that's true.\n\nWho lived here?\n\nWell, many people. But the most noteworthy when I looked up was Wagner Ricard Wagner lived here.\n\nOh my God.\n\nI asked my favorite AI search engine what Wagner and David Ame have in common. Oh\n\nNo, we're both control freaks.\n\nDidn't gimme that. It may not know you well enough yet. It says David Ame and Rahar Wagner shares several notable commonalities rooted in their contributions to the performing arts. You like it so far? This is crazy. Particularly in how they both innovated within their respective mediums. Okay, so this is legit. Ready? There are four pioneering theatrical storytelling required. Wagner as a composer and Libre assist to revolutionize opera with this concept of that word. I can never say Guam. Yeah, yeah, I love that. And David Ame as a contemporary playwright known for pushing the boundaries of dramatic form and content. I don't know what you call the face you just made. It's all\n\nRight. It's like a Jewish fa. It's like by Larry David.\n\nOkay, if you say so. Number two, focus on music as central to their work. Okay, not a bad point. I mean, he was a musician, but okay. Number three, exploration of artistic process and creative tension. Wagner's works often depict artists, gods and mortals struggling with creation, ambition, and interpersonal conflict. While ame stereophonics similarly dramatizes the intense, often fraught dynamics. And number four, influence and controversy. Both have attracted controversy, Wagner fors, personal views, and the revolutionary nature of his art admi for legal disputes over the sources and inspirations for plays including Stereophonic and its alleged parallels to Fleetwood Macs history.\n\nSo, all\n\nRight.\n\nThat's what the AI machine has to say about you and Wagner. What do you think?\n\nNo comment.\n\nCan you gimme some kind of response to this? The lawsuit that the AI brings up? This was a Fleetwood Mac adjacent lawsuit. There was a settlement. I understand. Say what you can or will.\n\nI can't say anything. You know, I'm not a lamp. We settled it. I'm so glad we settled it.\n\nThe play did not have to change as a result of the lawsuit, I assume, or am I wrong? No. Was there a serious concern at some point that you might have to either shut down the show or rewrite\n\nParts? Well, we couldn't do anything with the lawsuit hanging over us. We wouldn't have been able to go to London or do a tour or anything like that. It was too\n\nFraught. I know the settlement amount is not made public as it never is in these cases, but I would assume that might have been a contribution to why it took a little while to recoup. Yeah, a chunk must have gone there.\n\nI mean, I don't think I'm allowed to say, but no,\n\nThe case had been brought by Ken Klay, a producer and engineer who worked on Fleetwood Max record rumors and who wrote a memoir called Making Rumors. There are, as I mentioned earlier, a lot of Fleetwood Mac parallels in Stereophonic from the makeup of the band itself to the way that the Peter character like Lindsay Buckingham in real life winds up taking over the project. There's also the fact that both Peter and Lindsay have a brother who's an Olympic swimmer. But now that the lawsuit has been cleared, Stereophonic is playing in London with sold out houses and rave reviews, and there will be a US tour later this year. I'm Steven Dubner.

Edward Jones, member, SIPC.\n\nSo what's different about the London production of Stereophonic from the New York production? The\n\nCast is, three of them came from New York and they all had the option to come, but the rest of 'em said, no, we don't wanna come. Okay. So we recast it.\n\nOh, they all did have the option.\n\nThey all had the option. Listen, it's a very, very draining play to do. They were just like, we've done it. We came out in January and we recast the farther roles and it was very, very hard because it's not just about getting people to play instruments and who are good actors. They have to feel a certain way. I mean, I really cast for the quality first and then it's like, okay, how can you act and can you play instruments?\n\nWhat do you mean cast for quality? First\n\nI wanted people who felt like artists and that they were a little bit weird. I didn't want people that felt like actors. A lot of actors are really good actors, but they feel like actors acting. I didn't want that for this show, and I really wanted to give the audience a very easy ramp into the kind of naturalism that we're asking in the play. And we found these actors, but there were like one or two like, okay, you could play that role. You're the only one. You could do it\n\nIn all of England,\n\nKind of. But that's what happened in in America too.\n\nSeveral cast members of Stereophonic in New York weren't really musicians. Tom Ppaca, who played the Peter character, had told me that before he started training for rehearsals, he only played what he called garbage guitar. But some of the London cast members are experienced musicians\n\nAt Playwright's Horizons. It was like, you know, what's that movie where they were getting the ship up the Hill\n\nFitzcarraldo?\n\nThat's what that was. It was a little bit like, oh my God, this is gonna kill me. Whereas, you know, three days in, they were playing all the songs and then it sounded great. They're musicians. They can do this\n\nWith zero disparagement toward American cast. Would it have been a different experience had you cast actors who were also musicians for the American version? I'm\n\nSure it would've been different. Would it have been better? Not necessarily because so much of the charm and the deliciousness of that experience was the meta story of can we make ourselves a band? Can we do this? Can we play instruments? It was wild seeing them step up to that plate for Will Brill, to learn how to play bass, and for Tom to learn the riff for Masquerade.\n\nThey\n\nWere so petrified, but inside of that fear was a kind of laser focus, like a minute to win it, and it brought out something very primal and thrilling that made its way into the performance. So I actually think it helps us in a certain way.\n\nI understand there's a new song for the London production. Yeah.\n\nIt's not in the production, in the play. Diana speaks about this song, which is from the first album, and it's the song that starts creeping back up the charts and then propels their album into success. So Will said, I'm gonna write that song, and then he said, I'm gonna give the cast something to do that's their own, to let the British cast shine for themselves and they kill it.\n\nI read that Brad Pitt's film production company is acquired rights to Stereo phonic. True.\n\nI don't know if they acquired the Rights. They're just my producers for the film, which I'm writing right now.\n\nOh, so you're writing\n\nThe film? I'm writing the film. I just decided not to sell it to a studio quite yet because I'd like to take my time and get it right and not have to take notes. Part of the problem is like, okay, you like the play now. What do you imagine the Hollywood version of it to be? I don't even know what it is yet. I have to redo the whole thing in my mind. Is\n\nThis gonna take another 10 years roughly?\n\nI hope to God not. I mean, I am working on it right now and I can't rush it, but I don't wanna do a bad movie and I really want it to have the integrity that the play had, but it can't be a play.\n\nCan you give a couple ideas just of how the film would be different from the play?\n\nI can't talk too much about the film 'cause I don't wanna jinx it. There are talkie speeches that will never be in this film. I love them and they're central to the play and they can't have anything to do with it. There's a character who is alluded to this receptionist who is an aspiring singer model person who sort of works her way through the band, who becomes a character in the film. I love writing her. It's a big thing in the play. This demarcation between public and private, those spaces are quite collapsed in the play. Everything becomes public 'cause they're just in the studio and there's no escape.\n\nIt's inspiring to me that you're so confident about this because it's a different kind of writing.\n\nIt's totally different and you have to embrace it, but I don't have an ego about it all, so I think that's where playwrights get in trouble, like, oh, my wonderful play. It's like, no, no, I've gotta kill. It's like Oedipus, kill the play. Marry the movie. You know what I mean? That's how I'm approaching it. I can't deify this play. This play is its own thing and there's things that I'm gonna keep because they're gonna work in the movie, but I have to figure out the proportions and stuff. It's just different. What\n\nAbout other plays? What are you working on?\n\nI'm doing a play for the public theater that I can't really talk about. It's a two part play.\n\nIs it contemporary? It\n\nIs, but it also spans something like 50 years. It's very different from Stereophonic. It couldn't be more different and I can't talk about it. I can't. I'm gonna get in trouble.\n\nDoes it engage more with the outside world than Stereophonic does, whether that's political engagement or whatnot? Yeah,\n\nIt does, but not because I felt an obligation to. I think that's where artists get into trouble when they're being pointed. Oh, let me write about the issue of the day because it's very important and I need to speak to it. I never do that. I don't like those kind of plays, and yet I've written one. Despite the fact that I dislike it. It came from a place of obsession and not understanding what I was examining. That's when I trust myself. When I'm coming from a place of rational inquiry, that's when I know I'm on the wrong track.\n\nI've heard you talk about this notion of an event, a thing that happens in a given place in time and that there's less and less appreciation of that, and I will say as a human, that worries me a little bit because we've lived the entirety of our civilization with that notion, so I don't know.",

      "transcript_chunk": "and became a real historical cultural part of America. It was said that you were not allowed to talk about the Essex on Nantucket because it was an event in their history they were not particularly proud of. This is not something for the Chamber of Commerce brochure.\n\nBy the time Moby Dick was published in 1851,\n\nNantucket was no longer the world's leading whaling port. That baton had been passed to New Bedford.\n\nNew Bedford lies on the Massachusetts mainland. It had been founded by Nantucket's by the 1850s, it was the wealthiest city per capita in the United States. How did Nantucket lose its lead?\n\nNantucket in the early 1840s was extraordinarily prosperous, but it had a problem. The harbor was too shallow for these large ships that had developed. And so a lot of the whaling trade was going to the mainland, specifically New Bedford. And then in 1846, the island suffered a great fire, which destroyed a third of downtown, all of the waterfront, and then the discovery of gold in 1848. Many Nantucket said, whoa, with wailing on the decline here, that is the future.\n\nSome of the most ambitious Nantucket sailed their ships to California all the way around Cape Horn at the southern tip of South America in the hopes of finding gold.\n\nAnd those ships were abandoned at the Golden Gate. To this day, when a new office building goes up in San Francisco, they often find the bones of an old whale ship.\n\nSo Nantucket was in steep decline as New Bedford rose. But within just a few decades, new Bedford also lost its grip and the US whaling industry essentially collapsed. Why? There were several reasons, some of which won't surprise you, but others will. That's coming up in a minute. I'm Steven Dubner. This is Freakonomics Radio and we are talking Whales.\n\nToyota (35m 54s):\nFreakonomics Radio is sponsored by Toyota.

McDonald's valid once a day must opt into rewards.\n\nSo how did you get into Whaling scholarship in the first place? Was it a case of needing a dissertation topic when you were getting your PhD?\n\nI wasn't needing a dissertation topic, but I fell in love with whaling. I visited the New Bedford Whaling Museum, which is a wonderful place to visit and learned the stories of the industry, all the records that survive and the fascinating challenges that people in the business faced and just thought it's an amazing context in which to try to think about how businesses are organized, how compensation works, how risk is allocated, and so on.\n\nEric Hilt, you'll remember, is an economic historian at Wellesley College, which is about an hour's drive from the New Bedford Whaling Museum. HILT is also a top editor at the Journal of Economic History, the flagship journal in the field.\n\nIt's a small subfield academically, but it's growing. It's an important part of the field of economics actually. So I\n\nLove economic history, but it doesn't seem like there's enough of it, or at least not enough good of it. Do you agree?\n\nYes. And I think as new technologies make historical research easier, there's greater interest in it. So there's two goals usually. One is to illuminate deep questions. In economic theory, history is like a separate world in which to test economic theories. Another part of it though is just to understand how the economy evolved. What are the forces responsible for the growth of, in this case, the American economy, what worked and what didn't? What are the deep institutional factors? How did technology play a role?\n\nOkay. What would you say were the key differences between investing in maybe a factory that's going to manufacture textiles versus being one of the investment groups you told us about earlier that are funding these whaling expeditions?\n\nThe most important difference is that the investments in the whaling ship are much more concentrated. So lots of textile businesses would incorporate and sell shares to investors and maybe have hundreds of owners. Whaling vessels were typically owned by a small handful of investors, often investors who knew personally the agent who was running things, the agent himself. And it was always a, he would typically own about a third of the vessel. So you have very, very concentrated ownership. And that was important for the success of the voice because it created powerful incentives for the agent to make really good decisions and do his job really well. Right? That gives him an incentive to work very hard to hire the best captains and do things as well as possible.\n\nSo as an economist, you probably like that set up, it gets rid of the principle agent problem, right?\n\nThat's right. It's a way to handle those very extreme principle agent problems that you see everywhere in the business world.\n\nThe principle agent problem is economists talk for what happens when two people in a business relationship seem to have the same incentives, but in fact may not. It might help to think of the principle as the boss and the agent as an employee. My Freakonomics friend and co-author Steve Levitt, has a favorite example of the principal agent problem. When the city of Chicago was trying to land the summer Olympics some years ago, the city was leaning on the police to crack down on prostitution. So the police bosses, the principles had a strong incentive to make that happen. But as Levitt discovered, while doing a study on the economics of street prostitution in Chicago, some police on the street had a different incentive because they had an arrangement whereby in exchange for protecting prostitutes from violence or arrest, the cops would get freebies from the prostitutes.\n\nAnd that is an example of the principle agent problem. The city of Chicago didn't get the Olympics, by the way, but what does all this have to do with wailing? Well, as Eric Hilt learned in his research, as the whaling industry grew, more investors wanted in and ownership became less concentrated. Some states even granted corporate charters, which shifted the management of whaling ventures from small investor groups to corporate boards and executive officers. This also introduced, at least theoretically, the principle agent problem.\n\nThat's right. So in an environment where the person handling all important managerial decisions is not a major owner, they just have less skin in the game, there's less at stake for them. In some cases, they were not even owners at all. They were just paid a salary. And in a case like that, you know, they'll check off the boxes, do what's needed, and that's it. They have very little writing on the success of the voyage. And indeed, on average, those voyages were not super successful.\n\nWas there equity or participation by the high ranking employees, captain and the mates and so on?\n\nIt was pretty typical for captains to own a small share of the voyages to give them higher power incentives. So that's another unique thing about whaling. The crews, including the captain, were paid in shares of the produce of the voyage. They weren't paid ordinary wages. So that gave them strong incentives in the same sense that the agent himself had strong incentives, but it also meant that, you know, the crew members were bearing a lot of risk. And if the voyage didn't turn out very well, they wouldn't be paid very much. Can\n\nYou think of a modern parallel in which there's one industry or one pursuit wailing, right? Going on a ship and getting whales that it's done in these two different managerial ways. One is sort of a corporate model, the other more of a partnership model. Is there a modern version of that?\n\nOkay, investment banking.\n\nAh, yeah, yeah.\n\nSo investment banks we're typically organized as partnerships. But you know, starting in the 1950s, they began to make the transition from the partnership model to the corporate form. So you have incorporated investment banks and then the real change happened in the seventies when some of them became not only corporations, but public companies.\n\nAnd when you're an economic historian doing empirical research like that from an industry, you know, 120, 150 years ago, what are you, I mean, I don't mean to be disparaging at all, but what are you hoping will be the best outcome? Are you hoping that some federal regulator might read this and say, oh, look how much more sensible this setup of the industry was then compared to now, for instance, where private equity players can come and go as they please, and no one really has any idea where the money's going, et cetera, et cetera. What are you hoping for?\n\nWell, so not that there's, there's no chance of that, but it does contribute to a deeper understanding of how our economy works today. If you think about it,\n\nThe American whaling industry had been a dynamo from pre-revolutionary days up through the mid 19th century. But now it began to crumble. Did the new corporate structure of whaling firms hasten the end? Perhaps a bit, but mainly it was done in by the same thing that destroys nearly every industry over time competition.\n\nSo it becomes possible to make cheap substitutes for whale oil products. Coal, gas became a substitute for the use of sperm oil in illumination in cities for streetlights, especially kerosene becomes very widely available, especially after petroleum is mined in Pennsylvania.\n\nThat's right. It turned out there were energy sources to be found right here on dry land. You only had to dig up some rocks or sink a drill into the ground. No need for the whole ship, voyage, the danger, all that moby dick stuff that can happen at sea. Some of these new jobs were also dangerous, but they were plentiful and they paid well.\n\nAs the country develops and becomes more prosperous, wages are increasing and the opportunities available to ordinary workers start to become more attractive relative to wailing. And then also I think part of the appeal of wailing both to investors and to workers is the prospect of a lucky bonanza, super lucrative voyage. When the industry's in decline, the prospect of that diminishes. And also the prospect of having a career in whaling where you might rise from an ordinary semen as the rank was called to an officer or maybe even a captain of a whaling voy that's also fading into memory.\n\nInvestment dollars also stopped flowing to the whaling industry. Nathaniel Filbrick, while researching the history of Nantucket, came across a variety of whaling industry veterans who found other places to invest their money, time, and ideas.\n\nSome of the Nantucket who went west, one of them would be a kid named Jimmy Folger, who would realize that the way to make it rich isn't mining for gold, it's selling roasted coffee beans to the miners. And that would become Folger coffee. There would be a Macy who went wailing, got a tattoo of a red star, and realized whaling wasn't his future. He was going to be a merchant and he would ultimately open Macy's in New York.\n\nThe decline of American Whaling was also significant for the whales themselves, especially Baline and right whales whose populations had been severely diminished. Even today, there are thought to be fewer than 1000 right whales in the world. Overall. There are an estimated one and a half million whales of all types across the world's oceans. Before the industrialization of whaling, it's estimated there were between four and 5 million.\n\nAnd on Nantucket there is a lot of residual guilt about the fact that here we have all these knickknacks with whales on them, which you know, we all treasure in one way or another. But back in the day, they were what every Nantucket boy long to throw a harpoon at when he became of age.\n\nI think the damage to whale populations has contributed to growing environmental consciousness,\n\nAnd that again is Eric hilt.\n\nBut the greatest damage was not actually done by the 19th century American whaling industry.\n\nWait, what? The greatest damage wasn't done by the massive American whaling industry we've been talking about.\n\nThe damage was done by the modern whaling industry. So the modern whaling industry killed probably four or five times as many whales as the 19th century Americans. You know, they're using much more efficient methods and they hunted whale populations close to extinction. That's\n\nRight. When the Americans got out of whaling, in large part because there were better job opportunities, there was another country just starting to up its whale game.\n\nIt begins in the late 19th century. It's dominated by Norwegians\n\nComing up next time on the show, how Modern whalers used new technologies to take on new species of prey, including the big ones,\n\nThe blue whale's, the largest animal ever to live on Earth can be like a hundred feet long. When\n\nThe whales were killed, they pumped them full of air so that they could float.\n\nAnd how after World War ii, the US encouraged the Japanese to expand their whaling industry.\n\nWhale Hunt will help alleviate Japan's food shortage and ultimately save over $20 billion for American taxpayers.\n\nThat's next time on the show.

      "transcript_chunk": "s.\n\nIt just strikes me that the two of you have exposed a pretty large and foundational layer of the global economy that many people either don't wanna know about or don't have the resources to find out about. But when it comes to the government, it still just surprises me that there's so little appreciation for the depth and wealth of this industry. So do you see that changing in the US and UK at least?\n\nI think there's been a vast amount of complacency from governments in the West about commodities thinking that's the past, that's the old economy. The market will sort it out. We don't need to worry about that. We don't need to have lots of policy to do with that. Leave it to some technical specialists and probably don't fund that technical specialist very well. There's not an awful lot of consideration to commodity markets 'cause they maybe don't affect ordinary voters quite so directly as other things of the economy. But I think it's a mistake the last few years has borne that out. Suddenly, you know, we've woken up in Europe to how being complacent about commodity supplies and commodity security has suddenly left Europe extremely vulnerable and is essentially in the process of killing a lot of the heavy industry of Europe through high energy prices.\n\nGovernments need to pay much more attention to this and need to think much more strategically and more long term about that. I don't necessarily think that everything that the current US administration is doing is a good idea, but commodities have risen up the list of political priorities and I think that's probably a good thing.\n\nDo you feel your book has changed the way commodities are traded or will be traded in the future?\n\nI think that the book has helped to bring a bit of transparency to the industry. We find more policy makers that are aware of who these companies are. It really concerns me that from time to time a government may invite Jack or me to speak to them as if we were the source of expertise in the industry. While it's very flattering, I'm thinking, geez, if the governments are calling us as the experts, they really have no clue what's going on. That is really the level of understanding of the industry where basically The World for Sale has become the defacto.\n\nIf you are interested into commodity trading, you need to read the book. Are the traders changing the behavior because of our book? I don't know. But we know that an oil trader from beet O, which is the worst, largest oil trader, was recorded by the FBI on a secret word type. And he was talking about us. He was talking about our questions and the fact that we were writing stories about commodity trading. And he said that the company that employed him was a bit nervous, so they needed to keep a bit of a low profile. So in so many ways, when we saw our names on the FBI wire top, and then, you know, he did call us an idiot, but it was quite good because we thought, well, maybe we do have a bit of an impact.\n\nJavier Bloss and Jack Farci have certainly had an impact on me. I hope you as well. Their book is called The World for Sale. Let us know what you think. Our email is radio@freakonomics.com. Coming up next time, the economist Austin Goolsby, a repeat guest on this show is now President and CEO of the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago, which puts him at the center of some important debates.\n\nFrom the beginning. They started asking, are you a dove? Are you a hawk? I don't even know if I like birds. I just want to be a data dog.\n\nAnd what does it take to be a data dog?\n\nThere's two main rules. There's a time for walking and there's a time for sniffing. And the first rule is know the difference. The second rule is you never throw anything away. The diet of the Datadog is eat anything that hits the floor.\n\nWe ask Gouldsby to walk us through the Fed's data and tell us what it means for the US economy. That's next time on the show.

      "transcript_chunk": "say we are gonna be the most pro-family nation.\n\nAgain,\n\nWhat you just said about family leave being an issue in the pro-life camp makes me think about all the issues that have been historically associated with Democrats, many of which seem to have been quite successfully co-opted by Republicans over the past few years. There's lowering prescription drug prices, paid family leave and other pro-family policies as you mentioned, expanding the child tax credit, even addressing the affordability crisis. Can you talk to me for just a moment about this notion of Republicans co-opting these democratic planks? And I know that there have been plenty of times where Republican planks become Democrat and vice versa, but I want you to speak to that, especially if you don't mind carrying it into the question about what the heck has happened to the Democratic party.\n\nIn other words, if you had all these positions that so many people, including a lot of Republicans are now in favor of what happened?\n\nYeah, well look, if you look at the data, every poll I looked at when you took the names away, Republican, Democrat, Trump, Harris, get all those names and just poll the policies of the candidates. You saw that the policies of the Democratic Party were winning in a much more significant way than the general policies of the Republicans. People ask me all the time, well what's the Democratic party gonna do to save the Democratic party? I say the Democratic Party is more concerned about saving the Democratic party than serving the American people. Then the Democratic party doesn't deserve to be around. This is a moment that we are about to see a generation of leaders step off the stage. The last baby boomer president, the last baby boomer head of the Senate for us Democrats, and this is a time I believe that we need to redeem the American dream.\n\nThis idea that anybody born in any circumstances can make it in America. The very idea of America, we need to make real again.\n\nThere is another democratic position, yours actually promoting what you call baby bonds that is included in Trump's bill but with a new name now it's called Trump accounts. What do you think of that?\n\nYes, God bless the idea behind it that that, that I have been trumpeting for about 10 years. The idea that every kid in America could have an individual investment account that they could watch on their phone. The power of that is transformative. The way they have written it right now benefits the wealthy and hurts the poor.\n\nHow so?\n\nThere are asset limits to qualify for food stamps. There are asset limits to qualify for Medicaid. A poor family who has a thousand dollars or more in the individual investment account can make them ineligible for those important benefits.\n\nYou're saying the money from the baby bond or whatever you wanna call it, would make them ineligible for certain benefits that they'd otherwise receive?\n\nYes. And then another part of it that they don't correct for 'cause our bill was written in a way that was progressive, that the lowest income kids would see some of the greatest benefits. The way they've written it actually is the reverse of that right now. It says that a family could put up to $5,000 into those accounts and enjoy the tax benefits while working families, low income families are not gonna be able to do that. And I'm fine with that, but maybe we should be doing some things to address that. The benefit could be going upwards and I think there's some design elements that could get something like this back on track. If only Donald Trump and others would listen to me in their design, we could correct for some of these failings.\n\nI know you've talked a lot about housing affordability or the lack thereof, which is you know, a big and complicated problem that involves government in many ways. I know there's something in this bill about, I think Mike Lee is most involved in this from Utah has to do with selling off public lands, some of which might be for oil and gas drilling, but some of which might be for development including housing. Now, I don't think Utah has any scarcity of land for housing. I don't know. I'm a New Yorker. Everything seems wide open to me by comparison, but is that a viable way to make more land available for housing and will that actually trigger more housing by selling off more public land?\n\nNo. God no. It's disastrous. I mean this is one of the most outrageously unpopular parts. Taking our most precious shared resource public lands across America and selling them to the highest bidder so that very wealthy people can find ways to exploit that land for greater wealth, not for the country, but greater wealth for themselves. If you want to deal with housing as a guy who doubled the production of affordable housing in his city during the great housing bubble burst, use the bill that I already passed with Tim Scott and we can make it more att tuned to housing called Opportunity Zones. There is so much capital sitting on the sidelines right now that we can incentivize into the investment of affordable housing.\n\nIf you create the right kind of tax incentives, I'm more than happy to give people bigger margins on their profits by creating a tax treatment for people that are investing in affordable housing.\n\nIf you had to bet, do you think that the selling of private lands will get through in the reconciliation or no?\n\nThere are so many people speaking about how bad this bill is. The more the word gets out, the more the backlash is gonna be and the more likely Republicans are gonna say, Nope, get rid of this section. We're already hearing it. Josh Hawley is now screaming about what this could do to rural hospitals. I'm hearing others talk about Medicaid and the selling off of Americans. Public lands is wildly unpopular.\n\nThat plan to sell federal lands did indeed get killed off last week during the reconciliation process. And there were many other changes. But as of this recording, Trump's mega bill is set to become law with zero Democratic votes in either the House or the Senate before the final house vote. Democratic leader Hakeem Jeffries, spoke in protest for nearly nine hours. He called the bill unconscionable, unacceptable and un-American coming up after the break.

It was a filibuster against the Civil Rights Act. Corey Booker, by the way, is black. Here is a portion of his speech from near the end.\n\nThere's a room here in the Senate named after Strom Thurmond. To hate him is wrong. And maybe my ego got too caught up that if I stood here maybe, maybe just, maybe I could break this record. The man who tried to stop the rights upon which I stand. I'm not here though because of his speech. I'm here despite his speech. I'm here because as powerful as he was, the people were more powerful\n\nAlong the way. He read some correspondence he'd received from his constituents in New Jersey.\n\nThis is a small postcard handwritten from somebody from Hamilton Square, New Jersey. Dear Senator Booker, I'm writing to ask you if my social security is now in danger, please let\n\nMe know. He cited reports from government agencies and from think tanks including conservative think tanks.\n\nMichael Strain, an economist at the Conservative American Enterprise Institute. I know a EI. Well said. Trump's policies on trade and immigration and his slash and burn approach to federal job cuts would have a damaging effect. This is a conservative think tank. What President Trump has proposed will not cause a recession. He continued, but it will slow economic growth. It will take money out of people's pockets. It will increase the unemployment rate. It will cost people jobs. It will make American businesses less competitive. That's a EI folks.\n\nBooker gave the speech as a sort of tribute to his late friend and mentor, John Lewis, a civil rights activist and congressman who liked to talk about the need to make good trouble.\n\nThis is a moral moment. It's not left or right, it's right or wrong. Let's get in good trouble my friend. Madam President, I yield the floor\n\nSo I want to come clean. I did not watch all 25 hours of your speech on the Senate floor. I watched a lot. It was a moment that kind of stopped the country at least for a lot of people. Can you just gimme a little bit behind the scenes? I'm really curious to know how much planning and preparation went into it.\n\nEverywhere I was going, people were saying to me, you're not doing enough. I remember being in the supermarket in Newark and these are folks that have known me since the nineties and these are people who still roll up to me in their car when I'm jogging and say things like, you're gaining weight mayor. And I'm like, I am not your mayor. I am your senator,\n\nBut are you gaining weight?\n\nYes I am. But Jerry of my best friends, I was in the supermarket and somebody was saying to me, why don't you Democrats do this? And I was like, we only have 47 votes. Well why don't you do this? I said, you need the majority. And they're like, Corey, we voted for you because you were that guy that did a hunger strike in the project for 10 days. Why are you telling us what you can't do when you used to find a way outta No way. And it was like the straw that broke the back for me because I was like, I have no response other than you're right. I began pulling my team together to throw around ideas about how we could cause good trouble. And this was one of the ideas we came up with. We've got more in our pocket to try to do what we wanted to do. The goals were really to draw attention to the people who were going to be suffering because of what Donald Trump was doing.\n\nAnd the prep was a lot. I mean over a thousand pages. We didn't wanna read Green eggs and ham. I challenged my team, get me conservative think tanks. We quoted the Cato Institute in a EI get me Republicans voices from business leaders to political leaders. Let's just do this in a way that if you were a moderate in America, this would be compelling to you. And then I had to physically prepare to be honest with you, like I was terrified about how would I get through all these hours without having to go to the bathroom. So I I just figured out how to hack that.\n\nYou went astronaut diaper?\n\nNo, I decided to do what my emergency room doctor cousin thought was really reckless as a middle aged African American man. I thoroughly dehydrated myself and didn't drink liquid for a long time and didn't eat for a few days and that's why she parked herself in the gallery for the entire 25 hours. 'cause she thought I was a stroke\n\nRisk. You probably lost a few pounds though. I\n\nLost a lot of weight and tore up the carpet beneath me because my feet started getting numb in the third hour. 'cause your blood doesn't circulate that well.\n\nI'd like to know what you heard, especially from Republican colleagues afterwards. You've spoken about the quote, appalling silence and inaction of the good people on that side of the aisle and elsewhere. So do you think your performance move the needle in any significant way?\n\nWe did in the sense that the stories we centered elevated the voices of Americans and broke through in a way that we never imagined. Just on TikTok alone, 340 million likes. It ignited a lot of people to fight harder. We were all part of something. What you do, no matter how small you think it is, when you stand up for what's righteous, you send out ripples.\n\nSo you and I have spoken a few times before, I believe the first was in 2016, several months before Trump was elected, the first time you'd been in the Senate a few years, you were still relatively junior. I went back and I listened to that interview and it's a bit of a time capsule. It's just remarkable how the tone of politics has changed. You talked about how much bipartisanship there was. You talked about the quote, incredible allies across the aisle that you're working closely with the Koch brothers team with Newt Gingrich, even Grover Norquist. Considering where partisanship is now, considering what's coming up the next couple months and years of this Trump two administration, which is probably just gonna produce more partisanship.\n\nCan you talk about anything actionable to roll that back to some degree?\n\nLook, I think Donald Trump is a colossal threat. His leadership is a colossal threat. And I'm not saying that myself. I could quote Republican leader after Republican leader, Republican senators who have even said that publicly and still say that to me privately. This is a corrupt president with corruption like we've never seen before. He is a president of sheer chaos and unfortunately he's a president of real cruelty.\n\nLet me just take that statement, which is powerful and respond to it by saying even so, you know, half the country voted for him and if he were to run again in a few years, which would not be allowed, but he might. It's not hard to imagine half the people in vote for him again. How can you explain that level of corruption, chaos and cruelties you just said, how can you explain that despite all that he gets the votes and he has an iron grip on the party?\n\nWell, I'm gonna say two things. One is I fundamentally disagree that he's got the ability to be reelected again. In fact, if the Constitution allowed it, I would love for him to be the candidate because he is again, back at spiraling down polling numbers. Independents are leaving him in droves and even within his own party, he's been taking a knock. So this idea that people haven't woken up and re understood why we rejected him resoundingly in 2020, they're seeing that again in the Hindu faith. Shiva is the God of destruction and also the God of renewal and new possibilities.",

      "transcript_chunk": "ly on fixed incomes. So the Social Security Administration starts arguing for something like Medicare. What a lot of people wanted was simply universal healthcare. What we did instead was we linked health insurance mainly with our employers. It makes a smidgen of sense in this moment in the late 1940s. Does it make sense in 2024, of course not one of the externalities of linking healthcare with employers is that what about people who are unemployed?\n\nSo people who are middle aged and unemployed in general in American history, no one cares about them. What about all these millions of older people who worked good jobs? They did their best. They're on social security. They are left out of this new system of health insurance, and so Medicare emerges to fill this gap. It has passed in 1965. It's part of Johnson's great society legislation.\n\nSo here's something you wrote between 1935 and 1975, old age security was arguably next to military might the central preoccupation of American policy. You write about the passage of the Social Security Act, Medicare and Medicaid Act, but additionally you write that every year legislation streamed from Washington that addressed problems in housing, nutrition and care for older people. It just astonishes me that so much effort was put into a policy framework that was forward looking in a way that we don't think of policymaking often these days. Can you explain why that happened?\n\nIt's a little hard to explain to be honest. I would say first coming out of World War ii, America is gearing up to fight the Cold War and they have to show that the American system has something to offer that the Soviets are wrong. This is not simply a dog eat dog world where the poor go to die and the rich tycoons drive over their bones. We have to offer something. One thing that makes old age an interesting bipartisan area of concern is that it's not really very socialist. Most reforms you can imagine and that people were proposing have some kind of link with a socialist tradition or with trade unions or the working class or economic inequality to pursue them is to criticize the system of American capitalism.\n\nOld age isn't like that. You can be in favor of serious old age benefits without making any claims at all about the justice or injustice of American capitalism. It's also not a special interest group really because it is of all the categories of need. One that barring catastrophe, all of us one day inhabit American policymakers knew they had to be doing something and this seemed like the safest area to pour really tremendous levels of resources. I think we need another period of innovation in this space because social security and Medicare have not really been touched and they are old. I mean, Medicare is 60 years old now.\n\nThink how much the healthcare space has changed.\n\nWhat sort of innovations would you like to see?\n\nWell, I like most people like Pulse show, like 80 or 90% of people would like to see modest reforms to at the very least save social security. It's one of the astonishing parts of the American political system that a very popular program is about to hit financial trouble in 12 or 13 years and the political will to address this is just non-existent. The bills are in Congress, they're relatively easy. Increase taxes on higher earners, move around the social security earnings limit and this problem can be resolved. This is the biggest poverty reduction program in the country. It's eminently fixable and it gets harder to fix. Every year we settle into what is now the very familiar dynamic where Democrats, all they wanna do is quote unquote defend social security and Medicare.\n\nAnd the right either doesn't talk about it at all or has these fantastical dreams of privatization that creates a dynamic where the right is trying to attack. The left is trying to defend and no one is trying to improve these systems, which is what is actually required.\n\nWell, some people do say that older voters have too much leverage and that it's often exercised at the expense of children and others.\n\nThat's a pretty common argument that people trot out. I think that there's been a lot of unfortunate discourse about Gerontocracy and the power of older voters 'cause I really do not think that that's true. Social security and Medicare were not passed by older voters. The A RP was not pushing for these things. The congress that passes Medicare is one of the youngest congresses in American history. It had less Republican than democratic support, but it did have significant Republican support and I would say support by people in numerous age brackets. In fact, political scientists have shown that it's really middle aged people who are pushing for these things and the young Congress members. The reason is that these were understood at the time not as SOPs to the special interest old age lobby, but as a way to secure and stabilize the families of middle aged people.\n\nBecause who's actually in danger if you know, if Grandma falls, it's unfortunate for grandma, but it's really unfortunate for grandma's four kids who have to leave their jobs and things like that.\n\nSo keeping in mind the advances of social security and Medicare and other policy that aim to help older people talk about how modern retirement came to be a thing, it's easy to take for granted that this is the way it's always been, but it was shocking to me reading your book, how recent the phenomenon that we now see as normal wasn't at all normal for most people,\n\nThe fact that we have an expectation that I like my job, but at some point I'm gonna stop doing it and I would like to hang out with my kids and do some hobbies and service work for 10 or 15 years before I die. This is a very recent expectation for most of human history. There is no such thing as a formal exit from the labor force into retirement, let alone one where you could rely on some kind of payments either from your employer or from the state. The basic timeline is that in the fifties about 60 65% of older men are working. By the eighties, it's more like 2020 5%. Wow. It more or less has stayed stable since then. And it's not just that you stop working and hang out in your house.\n\nThere is a huge infrastructure of retirement desk created senior centers and senior citizens discounts and a RP cruises. All that stuff emerges really quickly over this period. One thing that's very interesting about the emergence of retirement after World War II is that a lot of workers did not want it. It was not really a demand of labor unions or the working class. Many workers, even in jobs that seemed to us exploitative or dangerous workers wanna stay in those jobs. And so there's a lot of resistance in the fifties and sixties to the creation of retirement, especially in this country to mandatory retirement. Mandatory retirement was actually a pretty big part of the American economy in the sixties and seventies.\n\nLots of workers in lots of fields were forced to retire when they turned 65. Americans hated that. That was one of the AARP's first big causes. It becomes illegal in the eighties in most fields.\n\nSo your main argument is that we had this massive boom in life expectancy mostly over the 20th century, which resulted in a lot more older people and that the boom is not just continuing but accelerating now. And you argue that we've adapted generally pretty well with policies including social security and Medicare and so on. In other words, if you just wanna look at the 20th century in Toto, you could say, wow, those were some really significant positive solutions to this growing issue. That brings us to now though 21st century. Where do you think we stand?\n\nWhat are the headwinds? Has progress stalled and what do you see as proposed solutions?\n\nThe issue of the booming population of 80 plus older people who need care has been persistently viewed as a kind of afterthought, like something that can be solved with very precarious sectors to the economy and by squeezing as much labor out of middle-aged women as possible. And I think there's a possible world where we say, actually no. This is going to be a major and dignified part of our economy. It's going to be well regulated. It does seem to me that progress in this area has stalled. What I would say more specifically is that progress has shifted to the private sector. So to take for example, assisted living facilities, these are in innovation in America in the 1980s, likes so much of what America does with old age policy.\n\nIt's something that European socialists came up with that was meant to be government funded and then Americans copied it and made it private. Insofar as there has been serious government action in the last few decades, it's often been to empower private industry even further. Something like Medicare Part C and the introduction that Medicare advantage plans, it's basically about giving private insurers a bigger role to play in healthcare for older people.\n\nIt's looking at the older population essentially as a market that can be divided up among private players. Yes,\n\nThat's right. And not as a category of need that we all share and that therefore the government should be involved in. One of the great promises that the American state makes to its citizens in the 20th century is you'll be cared for in your old age. This is a capitalist country. You are gonna work hard in middle age, but once you hit 65 or 67, you can relax a little bit. You've earned it. I think in the 21st century, our business should not be to roll back promises that were made a century ago. We should be thinking about how to secure them for the future.\n\nJames Chapel brings a historian's toolkit to the elder swell coming up after the break. How does an economist think about it? I'm Steven Dubner. This is Freakonomics Radio will be right back Before the break. We heard about the economic scaffolding that was erected decades ago for older Americans, but there are a lot more older Americans today than there used to be. So it's natural to wonder just how sturdy that scaffolding is. Here's one indicator. In 1965, there were four workers for every beneficiary of social security.\n\nThat number is now less than three and it continues to shrink. Meanwhile, the Trump administration has made major staffing cuts at the Social Security Administration even as more people than ever are filing for benefits. And with Trump's big, beautiful bill taking aim at Medicare and Medicaid, it's fair to say that the St sturdiness of the scaffolding going forward is at best uncertain. And it's not just here. Many countries around the world are dealing with the same problem. So it's time to bring on an economist to help us sort this out. His name is Andrew Scott.\n\nI'm an economics professor at London Business School and these days I'm somewhat obsessed with the topic of longevity.\n\nScott began his career in various advisory roles for the UK government, including in the House of Commons, the Bank of England and the Treasury.\n\nI do all the things you think a macro economist should focus on the monetary policy, fiscal policy, financial stuff. And then I got a little bit bored. There's only so many times you can talk about interest rates going up or going down.\n\nAnd so he became a professor.\n\nOne of the joys of working in a business school, you're always talking about those big trends that are gonna change the world. And so you're not just talking about interest rates, you're talking about globalization and artificial intelligence. I used to give this lecture on an aging society and it was pretty miserable. You just project for these endless numbers of old people. Old people are seen as a problem, they get ill, they need a pension. And then halfway through this lecture on aging society, there was a slide that said, Hey, on average we're living longer and we're healthier for longer. And I thought that sounds quite good. How do we turn that into a bad news story?\n\nThis led to Scott writing a book called The Longevity Imperative, how to Build a Healthier and More Productive Society to Support our longer Lives. The book opens with the story of Scott's identical twin brother David, who died a few days after they were born in 1965 in London that year, the most common age of death in the uk, what's called the modal age was between zero and one. Today, the modal age is 87. You did not mishear me. The most common age of death in the UK today is 87. It's the same In the U us.\n\nOne of the great achievements of the 20th century is to produce an aging society. It's so weird. We see it so negative. It's mourning the loss of fewer children. It's fewer parents snatched away a midlife. It's more grandparents meeting grandchildren and all we can do is turn around and say, oh my goodness, we have an aging society. I mean it's quite extraordinary.\n\nSo I have a feeling, I know how you will answer the following question, but I'm going to ask it anyway. Is aging a privilege or a curse? Well,\n\nIt's a privilege. I'll come at it from a very simple economic point of view, which is that an increase in life expectancy means we have more time. And for most people that's a good thing. So what do we fear about it? We fear outliving our health, our wealth, our skills, our purpose and our relationships.\n\nThose are a lot of things to fear, but sounds like you're about to help us supersede that fear somehow. Are you a magician?\n\nWell, no. We fear getting old. So what are you gonna do now to age better? That's never been an imperative before when there's only a 10% chance of making it to 90. You don't think I'm gonna spend my thirties, forties, and fifties preparing for a long life. Now we have to. That's a radical moment in human history because we've never had to support such a length of life.\n\nYou write in your book about what you call an evergreen economy. I was thinking about that recently because I was in Florida where you see an awful lot of businesses devoted to the aging. There's all kinds of medical facilities, classic car treatments, there's golf, you know, it's a lot of things that we associate with aging, longevity, retirement and so on. So that's, you know, an obvious tip of the iceberg. But when you take a step back and look at the bigger evergreen economy, everything from labor forces, pension, healthcare, et cetera, how do you expect it to be substantially different?\n\nMy big thing is to focus on a longevity society rather than an aging society. And I know immediately what happens when I see a consultant talking about an aging society. They start talking about the burden and then they start talking about cruise ships and care homes and the market potential, what I call the silver economy, all of which is valid, all of which is true. There are a lot more older people and the baby boomers mean there's even more older people 'cause that was such a large cohort for me, the evergreen economy is about how to remain fit and healthy throughout my life. So we should see a shift towards people eating more health, which we're not seeing everywhere, but we're beginning to see. It's gonna be about how you do lifelong learning. It's gonna be about how you can support working for longer.\n\nI think that's a really, really big change. 'cause in the 20th century we invented a three stage life, education, work, retirement. As we're living longer and longer and longer, we can't just stretch out that three stage life. Let's take the case of retirement. Retirement to be honest, has already gone. The notion that there is a single age where everyone comes to a heart stop of work has already disappeared. Some people retire at 60, some people retire at 70, some people go part-time, then they retire, then they're gonna unretire. We're seeing a much more complicated pattern.\n\nOne barrier to a lot of older people working longer is that they're not wanted. Their skills are considered outdated.",

      "transcript_chunk": "Chinese people of the West? Is there a similar level of misunderstanding the other direction as well?\n\nI don't think to the same extent because there's Hollywood, you can see daily American life, although it might not be totally realistic. There was a huge amount of admiration of US technology innovation, but also the American dream. I think our newspapers, even though there's bias everywhere, is not focused only on reporting the really bad stuff and portraying a negative side. I, I think these few years have been a little bit different. But so many students went to the us, right? So many people travel to the US and this is an interesting thing.\n\nI've rarely met an American who has been to China and who still goes on about how bad China is. I think that going to China makes all the difference.\n\nI feel that's like one of the big gaps of my life that I need to alleviate is to travel in a real way for a long time to really experience the people and the cultures. And China's a big place.\n\nGo, go dig deep and don't just Go to Beijing and Shanghai.\n\nLet's go back to the economics. So can you just dig a little deeper on the relationship in China between the government and the companies in the private sector? So how much freedom do companies have?\n\nAnother big misunderstanding and a fundamental one is that people somehow think that the state suppresses the private sector. It's not at all as simple as that. For the most part, if we look at the local government's incentive system, they wanna help the best private companies, which are the most promising because it makes them look good. It adds to their GDP, it adds to the jobs investment. They are so helpful to these private companies. Actually, I I, I know many of these local government officials working tirelessly day and night, especially in bad times to coordinate between debtors and creditors and to kind of smooth out and define relationships with banks.\n\nThey wanna help these private companies because again, their incentives are aligned. Deep seek is private company by the way. So it has done the country proud. And why would the state wanna go and suppress these private companies? Which ultimately is kind of a beacon, represents a beacon success for China now on how much freedom they have. It's really ranged from too much freedom. That's part of the problem where you have defense companies buying art auction houses, real estate companies like ever grande, buying soccer clubs, doing EVs companies, investing in real estate that has nothing to do with their core business.\n\nThat's how much latitude were given to private companies and there were consequences they were not reigned in. And then you Go to the other extremes where they're scolded, they're reprimanded, they're reigned in and they're kind of folded into submission. So that, that is the whole spectrum. You have the whole range. But I guess what we're really getting at is it is a country that is moving from a no rule of law or very little rule of law, very immature markets to something that is being gradually established. Bankruptcy laws, you know, corruption laws, rules and regulations on what's possible.\n\nOne interesting point is that in China, you, you ask the companies to innovate first and then you re regulate after, right? So that has led to things like P two P platforms, the, you know, it's led to lots of kind of financial innovations, some of which has actually been very helpful and good, some of which had been disastrous. But the intention to regulate after the fact is to really not slow down or hinder the innovation. This is a very different approach from Europe. You regulate first and then you know, con companies have to work around that. So the, this is why Chinese economy is so complex.\n\nYou cannot reduce it to simply a statement saying the state is unhelpful for the private or, or, or something like that. There are certain sectors where these SOEs dominate, right? When it comes to national security in terms of energy. But let's not focus on these few sectors. By and large, most of the economy, if you actually admit to the fact that China's highly innovative and highly entrepreneurial means that it must be the private sector that is driving the show.\n\nInnovate first, regulate after really interesting. I also in my mind am contrasting it with the way the Soviet Union and Russia since operated. That doesn't sound at all like this model. And it's interesting that countries that at least on the surface had a similar cultural communist problems. You know, the bureaucracies that form inside the communist state. It just seems that China broke away from that somehow. Yeah. That don't understand exactly what happened\n\nIn the west. They grouped these economies together as if they're the same thing. No, it's not the same at all. There's so many differences, so much more flexibility. You can have dynamic entrepreneurialism at the same time have socialist characteristics. And I think this is what China has been able to shape and mold a unique model that balances between government industry, between state coordination and market mechanisms and between individualism and communalism. It's not necessarily black and white. You can't have all these things at the same time.\n\nSo what are the pros and cons of being an entrepreneur in China versus the west? Like if you get a choice, you have a dream, you wanna build epic things, what? And you get to choose where to start that business. What are the pros and cons of each path\n\nIn China? The speed is just all inspiring. You have a good idea, you implement it, you realize you're dreaming very fast because there's also the support system, right? The infrastructure there, the digital infrastructure there, the engineers are there, the talent is there and they're cheap. And the market competition is there, is to keep, to keep you going. The consumers give you a very, very fast feedback. You know, well OMI was making phones and now it makes one of the world's best EVs 270,000 cars sold in one day a few days ago with a new model. They were phone makers. So there's an advantage to that. Okay? But I would not feel safe.\n\nNot because of danger of exploitation or nothing like that, but the BA bankruptcy laws are not there, right? It's not necessarily always fair competition. Things don't happen necessarily in orderly manner. If you have a competitor, you can have a very evil competitor and evil competitors are there everywhere in China. They would, you know, call the police on you, put you in jail, spread false rumors about you. Maybe that happens also in the US but there's a different, it's a different level in China. And also the mold that you can have to protect yourself. The IP protection, right? That's much weaker in China because the legal system is not very effective.\n\nYou have a good idea, you'll be copied and there's a lot of work. You have to, you have to dine in wine with the local governments. I mean that's not allowed anymore by the way. But you dine in wine, you know, figuratively speaking, you have to have a very good relationship with 'em. That's a different kind of work.\n\nThe wine and dine and the evil competitors is an interesting challenge that in some maybe distant ways akin to the problems of the Soviet Union. I think, I guess in the United States there's less of that. And I don't even know if that's based on laws. 'cause there's a lot of lawyers in the US that could do the same kind of evil competitor stuff. Technically\n\nThat's true. The potential negative ramifications are there, but I I, I think personal protection is a big difference. Few, you make a mistake if you, your company's not run well, you know, you Go to jail. I think that the US is much, much more tolerant on entrepreneurship, entrepreneurs on failure,\n\nSince we're talking about it. There was a, a lot of controversy around Jack Ma disappearing, quote unquote, and reappearing a bit later. And there's been sort of rumors of some tense relationships that he has with the Chinese government. What is important to understand about the health situation? Like to what degree is it reflective of the issues entrepreneurs face in China,\n\nIn the US capital controls politics? One could argue in China, it has to be the other way around. Capital must be reigned in by politics as part of the capitalist class. Do not have them ambition to exceed the powers of a political class is really at the core of it, I'd say. And the biggest difference between us and China, there are important details that I think think the West has not fully provided to the public, for instance, and financial, as innovative as it was, was doing banking jobs without being regulated like a bank, right?\n\nSo that obviously poses a host of financial stability questions and, and rules and regulations and so forth. So the fact that IPO was halted, you could say that there were strong economic regulatory grounds for that. But I think more broadly speaking, if you're an entrepreneur, part of the capitalist class, keep your head down, make money, and that's fine, right? Do some philanthropy. There are also many, many other billionaires that are just fine, that are actually very much in favor of the political leadership and they do their thing.\n\nNow, I'm not saying what's right, what's wrong. It's just a very, very different culture and different country in the us It's great to be colorful. I mean, you have a very, very colorful president. He would never have been able to make it in China. You have the likes of Elon Musk. It's great to be different, it's great to stand out. You do not wanna stand out in China. So the moral of the story is that the top leadership understands that it needs these top entrepreneurs, the likes of Jack Ma. And they have done so many great things for the country, even for the world. But in China, garnering too much influence and power, even through social media, doesn't make you look that great.\n\nIt's not a good thing for you personally. And, and there's a saying in China that you just don't wanna be the tallest tree, right? The tallest tree gets the most wind. So I don't agree at all with the western conclusion that this anecdote, this story has meant that entrepreneurs don't wanna be entrepreneurs anymore. The young kids don't aspire to be people like Jack Ma. That's not true at all. The, the incentives are still there. It's a different kind of rich elite class in China.\n\nSo, on, on what dimensions do you think that the height of the tree is measured? Is it, is it more about just mouthing off in public? So can you still be the richest person in China and actually not clash with the state?\n\nAbsolutely. Don't be too outspoken. Don't try to get too much attention and too much influence and just, you know, again, it's a cultural thing. But just keep your head down, be humble, you know, contribute to society, do philanthropy, work, collaborate with the government and you're kind of, okay.\n\nSo the signal the Jack Ma situation sends to the entrepreneurs in China is, is, is not, don't be an entrepreneur, is more like, don't be too colorful. Don't be too colorful. And colorful means you can be colorful about the technical details of, of your technology. But don't be colorful about Xi Jinping and, and, and politics and just stay out.\n\nYeah, stay out of politics. But I just wanna say that said, Jack Ma was really an emblem of extreme success, right? For China and the Chinese entrepreneurs look up to him. That's really important. It was a signal that unfortunately was misconstrued by the deciding and by also outside world. But it's laid a different path for what these entrepreneurs should be doing.\n\nWhat do you think happened to him? So he's now, I think living in Japan that's by\n\nChoice.\n\nBy choice.\n\nNo, he's, he, look, he's an extremely fascinating character, which, you know, and if he were in the US he'd thrive. Funny, witty, smart, wise, creative, loves a good life. And I think it's by choice that he's roaming around the world, given that he has more free time.\n\nYou think he loves China?\n\nAll of them do. All of them do. Because their lives, their, their destinies were totally changed because of China, because of the government, because of Deng Xing, because of everything.\n\nSo, you know, I know a lot of people from the, the former Soviet a union, and there's a deep resentment of broken promises, broken dreams. So that is not something you see,\n\nThat's not how I would describe that generation and their feelings towards China. Of course, you always get exceptions, right? The ones who have moved to the US and who, who, who wants a democracy. But by and large people are deeply grateful to China, the Chinese government, the Communist party, if you wanna label it as that, because they've seen their lives be totally transformed. I mean, Jack Ma went from being a school teacher to becoming one of the most powerful people in the world. I mean, if you didn't have China, what, what, how could that have happened? Right.\n\nCan you speak to the thing you mentioned a few times, which is the difference in American versus Chinese, or maybe Western versus Chinese approach to entrepreneurship, zero to one versus one to end. Maybe can you explain that? And what will it take for China to become a consistent zero to one innovator for the individual entrepreneurs to create totally new things versus doing the things you mentioned about speed and scale.\n\nThe US will lead for some time on breakthroughs on disruptive technologies, the zero to one technologies that ultimately changed the world. But innovation is a process. It goes from invention to production and commercialization and diffusion, diffusing technology throughout all parts of the economy. And on those two stages, I think that China has a unique advantage, even if it still can't do the zero to one breakthroughs, because in the end, how much this technology is adopted by the countries and by the various parts of the economy is fundamentally crucial to how much productivity will be unleashed.\n\nAnd China's innovation currently, the deep seeker is really one example. And I think it's really the beginning of the scale based, leading edge technology, cost, cutting driven kind of innovation model could be just as powerful, maybe even more effective and powerful than the breakthroughs. And as a very different approach to innovation, the Chinese companies focus on solutions, problem solving. Again, that comes back to the education system, right? You're giving a problem, I'm gonna find the answer. The Chinese students can do it. You want them to write their own question, they can't do it, right?\n\nI'm exaggerating a little bit, but it's a little like that, right? They see a problem they're gonna go after and they're gonna find the best solution. And that's really, really useful, right? Because we don't need, or developing countries especially, don't need these frontier technologies that they can't use. And China currently has this AI plus program, which is about pushing AI into every single plausible sector with the help of the state. So adoption diffusion is very important. Why China can't do breakthroughs or can't do zero to one technologies, I think at the root of it, and there are some deeper, we talked about the, the, the proximate reasons, the short, flat, fast, for instance, right?\n\nYou don't wanna spend too much time on investigating something that you don't even know if it's commercially viable. So basic research is still weaker than in the US universities, but also this kind of intrinsic motivation. It's very different, right? In China, it's driven by extrinsic motivation. You are rewarded by, you know, compensation, financial compensation, all these kind of extrinsic motivation is what drives you. But intrinsic motivation, pursuit of knowledge for knowledge sake, right? That was deep in the Confucius philosophies. But of course, you know, poverty has changed all that.",

      "transcript_chunk": "n that paradigm go?\n\nYou know, I think we've proven, and the AI community in general, that classical systems, Turing machines can go a lot further than we previously thought. You know, they can do things like model the structures of proteins and play Go to better than world champion level. And you know, a lot of people would've thought maybe 10, 20 years ago that was decades away, or maybe you would need some sort of quantum machines to, to quantum systems to be able to do things like protein folding. And so I think we haven't really even sort of scratched the surface yet of what classical systems so-called could do. And of course, a GI being built on a, on a neural network system on top of a neural network system on top of a classical computer would be the ultimate expression of that.\n\nAnd I think the limit the, you know, the, the what, what the bounds of that kind of system, what it can do. It's a very interesting question and, and and directly speaks to the peak equal MP question.\n\nWhat, what do you think, again, hypothetical might be outside of this maybe emergent phenomena, like if you look at cellular automata, some of the, you have extremely simple systems and then some complexity emerges. Yes. Maybe that would be outside or even would you guess even that might be amenable to efficient modeling by a classical\n\nMachine? Yeah, I think those systems would be right on the boundary, right? So I think most emergent systems, cellular automater, things like that could be modelable by a classical system. You just sort of do a forward simulation of it and it'd probably be efficient enough. Of course there's the question of things like chaotic systems where the initial conditions really matter and then you get to some, you know, uncorrelated end state. Now those could be difficult to model. So I think these are kind of the open questions, but I think when you step back and look at what we've done with the systems and the, and the problems that we've solved, and then you look at things like VO three on like video generation sort of rendering physics and lighting and things like that, you know, really core fundamental things in physics.\n\nIt's pretty interesting. I think it's telling us something quite fundamental about how the universe is structured, in my opinion. So, you know, in, in a way that's what I wanna build a GI for is to help us as scientists answer these questions like p calls mp.\n\nYeah. I think we might be continuously surprised about what is modelable by classical computers. I mean alpha fold three on the interaction side is surprising that you can make any kind of progress on that direction. Alpha genome is surprising that you can map the genetic code to the function kind of playing with the emergent kind of phenomena. You think there's so many combinatorial options that, and then here you go, you can find the kernel that is efficiently modelable. Yes.\n\nBecause there's some structure, there's some landscape, you know, in the energy landscape or whatever it is that you can follow, some grading you can follow. And of course, what neural networks are very good at is following gradients. And so if there's one to follow and object, and you can specify the objective function correctly, you know, you don't have to deal with all that complexity, which I think is how we maybe have naively thought about it for decades. Those problems, if you just enumerate all the possibilities, it looks totally intractable and there's many, many problems like that. And then you think, well, it's like 10 to 300 possible protein structures, 10 to the a hundred and you know, 70 possible go positions. All of these are way more than atoms in the universe. So how could one possibly find the, the right solution or predict the next step?\n\nAnd, and it, but it turns out that it is possible. And of course, reality nature does do it right? Proteins do fold. So that that gives you confidence that there must be, if we understood how physics was doing that in a sense then, and we could mimic that process, I model that process. It should be possible on our classical systems. Is is is basically what the conjecture is about.\n\nAnd of course there's non-linear dynamical systems, highly nonlinear, dynamical systems, everything involving fluid. Yes. Right. You know, that recently had a conversation with Terence ta who mathematically contends with a very difficult aspect of systems that have some singularities in them that break the mathematics. And it's just hard for us humans to make any kind of clean predictions about highly nonlinear dynamical systems. But again, to your point, we might be very surprised what classical learning systems might be able to do about even fluid.\n\nYes, exactly. I mean fluid dynamics, navio, stokes equations, these are traditionally thought it was very, very difficult, intractable kind of problems to do on classical systems. They take enormous amounts of Compute, you know, weather prediction systems, you know, these kind of things all involve fluid dynamics calculations. And, but again, if you look at something like vo our video generation model, it can model liquids quite well surprisingly well. And materials specular lighting, I love the ones where, you know, there's, there's people who generated videos where there's like clear liquids going through hydraulic presses and then it's being squeezed out. I, I used to write physics engines and graphics engines and in my early days in gaming, and I know it's just so painstakingly hard to build programs that can do that.\n\nAnd yet somehow these systems are, you know, reverse engineering from just watching YouTube videos. So presumably what's happening is it's extracting some underlying structure around how these materials behave. So perhaps there is some kind of lower dimensional manifold that can be learned if we actually fully understood what's going on under the hood. That's maybe, you know, maybe true of most of reality. Yeah.\n\nI've been continuously precisely by this aspect of VO three. I think a lot of people highlight different aspects, including the comedic and the meat Yes. And all that kind of stuff. And then the ultra realistic ability to capture humans in a really nice way that's compelling and feels close to reality. And then combine that with native audio. All of those are marvelous things about VO O three. But the exactly the thing you're mentioning, which is the physics, yeah, it's not perfect, but it's pretty damn good. And then the really interesting scientific question is what is it understanding about our world in order to be able to do that? Because if the cynical take with diffusion models, there's no way it understands anything.\n\nBut it seems, I mean, I don't think you can generate that kind of video without understanding and then our own philosophical notion what it means to understand then it's like brought to the surface. Like do to what degree do you think VO O three understands our world?\n\nI think to the extent that it can predict the next frames, you know, in a coherent way that's some, that is a form, you know, of understanding, right? Not in the anthropomorphic version of, you know, it's not some kind of deep philosophical understanding of what's going on. I don't think these systems have that, but they, they certainly have modeled enough of the dynamics, you know, put it that way that they can pretty accurately generate whatever it is, eight seconds of consistent video that by eye at least, you know, at a glance, is quite hard to distinguish what the issues are. And imagine that in two or three more years time, that's the thing I'm thinking about and how incredible that will, they will look given where we've come from, you know, the early versions of that one or two years ago.\n\nAnd so the Raider progress is incredible. And I think I'm like you is like a lot of people love all of the, the, the, the standup comedians and the the, that actually captures a lot of human dynamics very well and, and body language. But actually the thing I'm most impressed with and fascinated by is the physics behavior, the lighting and materials and liquids. And it's pretty amazing that it can do that. And I think that shows it that it has some notion of at least intuitive physics, right? How things are supposed to work intuitively, maybe the way that a human child would understand physics, right? As opposed to a, you know, a PhD student really being able to unpack all the equations.\n\nIt's more of an intuitive physics understanding.\n\nWell that intuitive physics understanding that's the base layer, that's the thing people sometimes call like common sense. Like it, it really understands something I think that really surprised a lot of people. It blows my mind that I just didn't think it would be possible to generate that level of realism without understanding you. There's this notion that you can only understand the physical world by having an embodied AI system, a robot that interacts with that world. That's the only way to construct an understanding of that world. Yeah. But VO three is directly challenging that, right? It feels like. Yes.\n\nAnd it's very interesting. You know, even if we, if you were to ask me five, 10 years ago, I would've said, even though I was a must in all of this, I would've said, well, yeah, you probably need to understand intuitive physics, you know, like if I push this off the table, this glass, it will maybe shatter, you know, and the, and the liquid will spill out, right? So we know all of these things, but I thought that, you know, and there's a lot of theories in neuroscience, it's called action in perception where, you know, you, you need to act in the world to really, truly perceive it in a deep way. And there was a lot of theories about you'd need embodied intelligence or robotics or something, or maybe at least simulated action so that you would understand things like intuitive physics. But it seems like you can understand it through passive observation, which is pretty surprising to me.\n\nAnd, and again, I think hints at something underlying about the nature of reality in, in, in my opinion, beyond just the, you know, the cool videos that it generates. And, and of course there's next stages is maybe even making those videos interactive so one can actually step into them and move around them, which would be really mind blowing, especially given my games background. So you can imagine. And then, and then I think, you know, you are, we're starting to get towards what I would call a world model, a model of how the world works, the mechanics of the world, the physics of the world, and the things in that world. And of course that's what you would need for a true a GI system.\n\nI have to talk to you about Video games. Yes. So you, you are being a bit trolley. I I think you're, you're having more and more fun on Twitter on X, which is great to see. So a guy named Jimmy Apples tweeted, let me play a video game of my VO three videos already Google cooked so good playable world models when spelled WEN and then you quote tweeted that with, now wouldn't that be something, so how, how hard is it to build game worlds with ai? Maybe can you look out into the future of Video games? Mm. Five, 10 years out. Mm. What do you think that looks like?\n\nWell, games were my first love really. And doing AI for games was the first thing I did professionally in, in my teenage years and, and was the first major AI systems that I built. And I always wanna, I have, I wanna scratch that itch one day and come back to that. So, you know, and I will do, I think, and I think I sort of dream about, you know, what would I have done back in the nineties if I'd had access to the kind of AI systems we have today? And I think you could build absolutely mind blowing games. And I think the next stage is, I always used to love making, all the games I've made are open world games. So they're games where there's a simulation and then there's AI characters and then the player interacts with that simulation and the simulation adapts to the way the player plays.\n\nAnd I always thought they were the coolest games because, so games like theme park that I worked on where everybody's game experience would be unique to them, right? Because you are kind of co-creating the game, right? We set up the parameters, we set up initial conditions and then you as the player immersed in it and then you are co-creating it with the, with the simulation. But of course it's very hard to program open world games. You know, you've gotta be able to create content whichever direction the player goes in. And you want it to be compelling no matter what the player chooses. And so it was always quite difficult to build things like cellular automat actually type of those kind of classical systems which created some emergent behavior. But they're always a little bit fragile, a little bit limited.\n\nNow we are maybe on the cusp in the next few years, five, 10 years of having AI systems that can truly create around your imagination, can sort of dynamically change the story and story, tell the narrative around and make it dramatic no matter what you end up choosing. So it's like the ultimate choose your own adventure sort of game. And you know, I think maybe we are within reach, if you think of a kind of interactive version of VO and then wind that forward five to 10 years and, and you know, imagine how good it's gonna be.\n\nYeah. So you said a lot of super interesting stuff there. So one, the open world built into that is a deep personalization the way you've described it. So it's not just that it's open world, that you can open any door and there'll be something there. It's that it's the choice of which door you open in an unconstrained way defines the worlds you see. So some games try to do that. They give you choice Yes. But it's really just an illusion of choice. Yes. 'cause you only like, like Stanley parable Yeah. Game I played. It's, it's, it's really, there's a couple of doors and it really just takes you down a narrative. Stanley Parable is a great video game. I recommend people play. Yeah.\n\nThat kind of in a meta way mocks the illusion of choice. And there's philosophical notions of free will and so on. But I do like one of my favorite games, Felder scrolls, Daggerfall, I believe that they really played with a like random generation of the dungeons. Yeah. Of if you can step in and they give you this feeling of an open world. And there you mentioned interactivity, you don't need to interact that that's a first step. 'cause you don't need to interact that much. You just, when you open the door, whatever you see is randomly generated for you. Yeah. And that's already an incredible experience. 'cause you might be the only person to ever see that.\n\nYeah,\n\nExactly. And, and so, but what you'd like is a little bit better than just sort of a random generation, right? So you'd like, and and also better than a simple ab hard coded choice. Right? That's not really a open world, right? As as you say, it's just giving you the illusion of choice. What you want to be able to do is, is potentially anything in that game environment. And I think the only way you can do that is to have generated systems, systems that will generate that on the fly. Of course, you can't create infinite amounts of game assets. Right. It's expensive enough already how AAA games are made today. And that was obvious to, to us back in the nineties when I was working on all these games. I think maybe black and white was the game that I worked on early stages of that that had the still probably the best AI learning AI in it.\n\nIt was an early reinforcement learning system that you, you know, you, you were looking after this mythical creature and growing it and nurturing it. And depending how you treated it, it would treat the villagers in that world in the same way. So if you were mean to it, it would be mean. If you were good it would be protective.",

      "transcript_chunk": "o love thy neighbor as thyself and so on. I can imagine people paying lip service to that, but certainly from a lot of contemporary commentary, and I think probably Robert would fall into that. From my reading of him, people struggled to actually follow it through in their daily lives.\n\nWould he have believed in curses and was he perhaps on either the receiving or giving end of a curse? Really\n\nHard to know that from this period because it's not showing up in quite the same way in our records. Certainly people talk nastily about each other.\n\nThe gossip and hearsay was so much bigger source of information in the Middle Ages than it is now. You would rely a lot on what other neighbors tell you\n\nAnd they did it without social media even. Exactly.\n\nThat was the social media basically gossip and hearsay. That was also the basis of the criminal justice system, by the way.\n\nWhat do you mean?\n\nThat's how they found the suspects. They would go around and ask people what gossip they have heard. If a crime has been committed and no one knows who committed it,\n\nBut then at a certain point you tried to gather some actual evidence. Yes,\n\nThat would be really difficult without forensic science. If you think about the way the modern criminal justice system works, if there are no witnesses to a crime, what are your fallbacks fingerprints and DNA analysis. None of that existed.\n\nSo what do you think the false conviction rate was?\n\nIn a place like Rome or Peru, which are neighboring places to Florence, the conviction rate was so low, only 10% of trials resulted in a conviction. 90% would be let go out of the reason that there is not enough evidence to convict them because the judges had it on their conscious. If they wrongfully sent somebody to execution, so they would have to let them go if there is not enough evidence.\n\nWas the legal system informed by religious feeling or religious devotion?\n\nOh yes, absolutely. Judges and the juries would always take an oath that they're going to follow the procedure, they are going to tell the truth somehow. People really have taken that quite seriously, especially the judges. You can see that they are cringing not to give in. They don't wanna execute people. They're very afraid that in the other life God will see them as a murderer if they do that without sufficient evidence.\n\nAnd then did they conversely assume that if someone did commit a crime but there is no evidence and the judge doesn't want to convict, do they assume that that criminal will be punished anyway by God?\n\nIt's not that they think that God will punish them anyway, so let us not punish them. That is not the case because they definitely did understand that if you do not hold people accountable, then crime will increase. You do need to detour people.\n\nHow was that balance struck with such a low conviction rate?\n\nThis low conviction rate belongs to the period where the trial started by an accusation. There are two types of trials. The ones that start basically because I go and say to the judge, my neighbor stole from me, and that would start a trial against my neighbor. I would denounce my neighbor myself, but then I would have to prove the guilt.\n\nI see. And the other way,\n\nAfter 1250s you get a new trial, which is the basis of the modern trial. We have inquisition trials. The state starts the trial. The state makes a case against a person based on the public rumors, based on gossip, and then the conviction rate goes higher. People resented that, especially in England, the start of the Inquisition trial. They said State has no business interfering into people's conflicts.\n\nInteresting.\n\nIt has been seen as an infringement into the rights of the people.\n\nYou mentioned this change came around 1250. There must have been a period where both systems were operating at the same time. Yes,\n\nExactly. Very good. In fact, if you go to the judiciaries, which still hold the ancient Medieval records, there are two books there, the Book of Acquisitions and Book of Inquisitions.\n\nHow long did the accusations last? When did that die out?\n\nWell, that's a very good question and frankly I do not know the answer. But it went on for a very long time. It was considered a right of the people to accuse someone who committed a crime against them.\n\nComing up after the break, let's talk about dying in the Middle Ages. The people we spoke with at the Renaissance Fair in New Jersey had some things to say about that.\n\nI don't think I would've survived a lot. I'm clumsy, weak. I probably would've broke my back pulling a plow or been trampled down by a Viking invader.\n\nI would've not survived\n\nAnything. I would like to think I would've survived the bubonic plague. But when the the hand of the Reaper comes a sweeping across Europe and wipes out a sizable percentage of the population, it doesn't matter what you did.\n\nI'm Steven Dubner.

As we all know, the definitive historical account comes from Monty Python and the Holy Grail\n\nOut. Your dad,\n\nBring out your dads one nine infants. I'm not dead. What? Nothing. Here's your nine infants. I'm not dead. Yeah, he says he's not dead. Yes, he is. I'm not. He isn't. Well, he will be soon. He is very ill. I'm getting better. No, you're not. You'll be stone dead in a moment. Oh, I can't take him like that. He against regulations\n\nAnd here is an actual historian, Philip Schofield,\n\nUndoubtedly death was there. I mean, death is always there.\n\nEven today. Apparently.\n\nYeah, apparently so. I've heard in the second decade of the 14th century, there is a period known as the great famine where maybe 10 to 15% of the population died. We can't really see the total impact of that because the most vulnerable are the least visible. We tend to think of peasant households as being complex and full of generations, but in reality they probably weren't. Mostly because people didn't live long enough really for that to happen. Something we don't know a lot about for this period, but we know about later periods as infant mortality. If you had a number of children and the strong likelihood is you would also have a considerable degree of loss in your life because of that violent death is also reasonably prevalent.\n\nAnd what about medicine in 14th century England? What happens when Robert, the son of Adam or someone in his family is sick,\n\nThey have a monastic community. That's their Lord. So they may seek support from their community. There will be an infirmary there. There are things called hospitals, but they tend to be relatively low scale. Unlike in Tuscany for example, where this period, there are substantial hospitals here. They are intended to house and support a symbolic number of poor, often the equivalent to the number of the apostles, for example. But you would have people that would travel around offering a range of skills, including some limited medical skill. So people who are barber surgeons who might help set an arm or do something like that.\n\nNestle shek you will remember located herself and her family in Florence. This is starting to look like a wise choice.\n\nThere were public hospitals in Florence, so if you are really sick and you need to be taken care of, then you can go there and anybody who volunteers there, they would take care of you for free. Still, the healthcare is obviously, compared to the modern knowledge that we have, is much more limited. They just do not know what are the causes of the many diseases.\n\nAntibiotics will go a long way to treat bubonic plague. But in the Middle Ages, obviously that was not available across Western Europe. Between 1347 and 1350, possibly 45% of the population died. What's remarkable is how society coped with that. I don't know how modern society would cope with 45% mortality, but there is in enormous continuity, there's a lot of contemporary comment and shock and fearfulness, but also the local records I was talking about record for instance, repeatedly X has died, Y has died, Zed has died, and so on. You get that persistence of normality in the face of something that was utterly abnormal.\n\nNestle, how about you living in 13th century Florence with your husband and two sons? How do you think about death?\n\nYes, that's the big question. I would worry about it. What will happen to me when I die and if I'm a divine Christian? Def, definitely I would believe in afterlife, so I would try to prepare myself and not leave it to old age because that's actually what a lot of people have done even in the Middle Ages. They live their youth rather frivolously.\n\nHow old would you expect to live until,\n\nOh, that depends on so many conditions, but I would hope that I can live until maybe 55, 60.\n\nHow old are you now in real life?\n\n52. I didn't\n\nRealize I was speaking with you so close to the end of your life. Well,\n\nYeah,\n\nI'm going to miss you.\n\nWell, there will be somebody else in my place doing the stained glass.\n\nNo, no, no. I don't mean your stained glass. I mean, I've taken a liking to you during this conversation. When you said 52, I imagined you living easily till 70 or 75.\n\nNo, I don't think that very often happened to ordinary medieval citizens.\n\nI asked Philip Schofield if he would've liked to live during the period he studies.\n\nI think for a short period of time, I'd be interested. One of the things that would be shocking would be the level of casual cruelty. These villages where people are living fairly close to a marginal existence can be harsh places. A woman cropped up in litigation that I was looking at recently who had been told to return eight hens that she'd purchased from somebody, and he then said, well, she's defamed me because she did return the eight hens, but she'd stitched their heads together. Ooh. I think that hints at a kind of culture that we might find difficult to immediately just settle into.\n\nIf you did have that opportunity, I mean, we're just talking about time travel here now, which is a constant fascination for so many of us. What are maybe one or two of the most unanswered or perhaps unanswerable questions about that life that you as an economic historian would really love to crack?\n\nWhat I've mentioned earlier would be the proportion of the truly vulnerable. What does that society look like if you walk down a street? Do you see in a village people that are mostly doing fine and supporting each other, or do you see desperation alongside relative prosperity? So it's not a particularly pleasant angle, but I think it's an important one. The degree of social inequality is something that our sources don't really give us full insight into.\n\nAnd would your main motivation for understanding that be gratitude from a modern perspective or simply empirical verification?\n\nIt would mostly be empirical in a sense that I'd really want to know what are the hidden stories in our history that we're not picking up that has its own solitary lessons, of course, for our contemporary society, about how we think of ourselves and what we miss in our society, and how we ignore those that perhaps are not as advantaged as others. You know, what are we missing? There was someone called Thel Rogers writing in the 19th century who said what he wouldn't give for a history of the medieval village when so much of a history is wasted on the froth of kings and queens.\n\nAnd I went back to Nestle Han Shek too. At the beginning of this conversation, you said you think you would prefer to live then as long as you could take your family with you. Now that we've talked about all these different elements, the economics and the legal system and religiosity and food, et cetera, et cetera, I'm curious how you're feeling about your choice. You'd prefer to be there then, even though according to you, you'd only have a few more years of life left. And it sounds like you're going to spend a lot of that life in church repenting and so on. Or would you rather stay with us here? Well,\n\nThat's a difficult question 'cause you know, I have a really nice life here too. But for one thing, I don't see the point of trying to live longer and longer. It's the same thing, just more. It depends on how I live the life that might be naive of me. The stress was much less in the Middle Ages. Now we have to deal with a million things. The technology in so many ways has made our life hell. The social media, the emails that you have to reply, electronic banking and taxes that you have to figure out. Also, the fact that you don't have electricity in many ways, you do get a very good rest. You don't keep working at night.\n\nWill you take me with you\n\nIf you're ready? Yes. Do you think you can do it?\n\nI don't know. At the beginning of this conversation, I never would've thought so. But you're fairly persuasive.\n\nYeah. Well, I have to be. I teach this, you know, I'm always looking for words.\n\nWhen we first had the idea for this episode to explore What It would be like to have been middle Aged in the Middle Ages, I thought it might be a ridiculous pursuit. But now that we've made the episode, I don't think it's ridiculous at all. It's something I love about history and historians. They are so good at bringing you into their world that your mind starts racing with comparisons to your own time. The benefits of the modern world are massive, but as Nestle, she Jacque pointed out, there are also significant costs.\n\nThe more people get into your life, the more difficulty your life becomes. And so I, I'd rather try to have a small life.\n\nHow do you think about our time versus that one?",

      "transcript_chunk": "or example. Yes. So like, you know, flash didn't take over the internet, but Moore's law law worked. So yes, we don't know which one AI is, which\n\nOne it is. And this is what I find so fascinating too. I forget who did this presentation, but someone in the web community, this great presentation on the history of the airplane. So you go from the Wright brothers flying in, what is it, 1903 or something like that, and 40 years later you have a jet flight. Just an unbelievable amount of progress in four decades. Then in 56, I think it was the halt design for the Boeing 7 47 century precursor was designed and basically nothing has happened since. Just minor tweaks and improvements on the flying experience since the fifties.\n\nSomehow, if you were to predict where flying was gonna go, and you were sitting in 42 and you'd seen, you'd remember the Wright brothers flying in oh three and you were seeing that jet engines coming, you're like, we're gonna fly to to the stars in another two decades. We're gonna invent super mega hypersonic flights that's gonna traverse the earth in in two hours. And then that didn't happen. It tapped out. This is what's so hard at predicting about predicting the future. We can be so excited in the moment because we're drawing a line through early dots on a chart, and it looks like those early dots are just going up into the right and sometimes it just flatten out. This is also one of those things where we have so much critical infrastructure, for example, that still runs on Cobolt, that about five humans around the world really understand, truly, deeply that there's a lot, it's possible for society to lose a competence.\n\nIt still needs because it's chasing the future. COBOL is still with us. This is one of the things I think about with with programming Ruby on Rails is at such a level now that in 50 years from now, it's exceedingly likely that there's still a ton of ruby and rail systems running around and very hard to predict what that exact world is gonna be like. But yesterday's weather tells us that if there's still cobalt code from the seventies operating social security today, and we haven't figured out a clean way to convert that, let alone understand it, we should certainly be humble about predicting the future. I don't think any of the programmers who wrote that cobalt code back in the seventies had any damn idea that in 2025 checks were still being cut off the business logic that they had encoded back then.\n\nBut that just brings me to the conclusion on the question for what should a young programmer do? You're not gonna be able to predict the future. No one's gonna be able to predict, predict the future. If you like programming, you should learn programming. Now, is that gonna be a career forever? I don't know, but what's gonna be a career forever? Who knows? Like a second ago, we thought that it was the blue collar labor that was gonna be extracted. First, it was the robots that were gonna take over. Then Gen AI comes out, and then all the artists suddenly look like, holy shit, is this gonna do all animation? Now it's gonna do all music. Now they get real scared, and now I see the latest Tesla robot going like, oh, maybe we're back now to blue collar being in trouble. Because if it can dance like that, it can probably fix a toilet.\n\nSo no one knows anything. And you have to then position yourself for the future in such a way that it doesn't matter that you pick a profession or path where if it turns out that you have to retool and re-skill, you're not gonna regret the path you took. That's a general life principle for me, how I look at all endeavors I involved myself in is I want to be content with all outcomes. When we start working on a new product at 37 Signals, I set up my mental model for its success and I go, do you know what? If no one wants this, I will have had another opportunity to write Beautiful Ruby Code, to explore Greenfield domain, to learn something new, to build a system I want, even if no one else wants it.\n\nWhat a blessing, what a privilege. If a bunch of people want it, that's great. We can pay some salaries, we can keep the business running. And if it's a blow weight success, wonderful. I get to impact a bunch of people.\n\nI think one of the big open questions to me is how far you can get with Vibe coding, whether an approach for a young developer to invest most of the time into Vibe coding or into writing code from scratch. So Vibe coding meaning, so I'm leaning into the meme a little bit, but the Vibe coding, meaning you generate code, you have the this idea of a thing you want to create, you generate the code and then you fix it with both natural language to the prompts and manually you learn enough to manually fix it. So that's the learning process. How you fix code that's generated, or you j you write code from scratch and have the LMS kind of tab, tap, tab add extra code.\n\nLike which part do you lean on? I think to be safe, you should find the the beauty and the, the artistry and the skill in both right from scratch. So like there should be some percent of your time just writing from scratch and some percent by coding. There should\n\nBe more of the time writing from scratch. If you are interested in learning how to program, unfortunately you're not gonna get fit by watching fitness videos. You're not gonna learn how to play the guitar by watching YouTube guitar videos. You have to actually play yourself. You have to do the situps programming, understanding learning, almost anything requires you to do. Humans are not built to absorb information in a way that transforms into skills by just watching others from afar. Now ironically, it seems AI is actually quite good at that, but humans are not. If you wanna learn how to become a competent programmer, you have to program. It's really not that difficult to understand.\n\nNow I understand the temptation and the temptation is there because Vibe coding can produce things perhaps in this moment, especially in a new domain you're not familiar with, with tools you don't know perfectly well, that's better than what you could do or that you would take much longer to get at. But you're not gonna learn anything. You're gonna learn in this superficial way that feels like learning, but is completely empty calories. And secondly, if you can just vibe code it, you're not a programmer, then anyone could do it, which may be wonderful. That's essentially what happened with the Access database. That's what happened with Excel. It took the capacity of accountants to become software developers because the tools became so accessible to them that they could build a model for how the business was gonna do next week that required a programmer prior to Excel.\n\nNow it didn't because they could do it themselves. Vibe coding enables non-programmers to explore their ideas in a way that I find absolutely wonderful. But it doesn't make you a programmer,\n\nI agree with you, but I wanna allow for room for both of us to be wrong. For example, there could be Vibe, coding could actually be a skill that if you train it and by Vibe coding, let's include the the the step of correction, the iterative correction, yes, it's possible if you give really good at that, that you're outperforming the people that right from scratch that you can come up with truly innovative things, especially at this moment in history. While the LLMs are a little bit too dumb to create super novel things and a complete product, but they're starting to creep close to that. So if you are investing time now into becoming a really good vibe coder, maybe this is the right thing to do as if, if it's indeed a skill, we kind of meme about Vibe coding, just like sitting back and in the, it's in the name, but if you treat it seriously, a competitive vibe coder and get good at riding the wave of AI and get good at the skill of editing code versus writing code from scratch, it's possible that you can actually get farther in the long term.\n\nMaybe editing is a fundamentally different task than writing from scratch if you take that seriously as a skill that you develop. I see. I don't, to me that's an open question. I just think I'm, I personally, now you're on another level, but just me, just, just personally, I'm not as good at editing the code that I didn't write. That's a different, no one is, no one is of this generation, but, but maybe that's a skill. Maybe if you get on the same page as the ai, 'cause there's a consistency to the ai. It's like it really is a pair programmer with a consistent style and structure and so on.\n\nPlus, with your own prompting, you can control the kind of work code you write. I mean, it could generally be a skill like\n\nThat's the dream of the prompt engineer. I think it's a complete pipe dream. I don't think editors exist that aren't good at writing. I've written a number of books. I've had ANU of professional editors. Not all of them wrote their own great books, but all of them were great writers in some regard. Give someone pointers if difficult for an editor to be able to spot what's wrong with a problem if you that it couldn't make the solution themselves. Editing, in my opinion, is the reward, the capacity to be a good editor is the reward you get from being a good doer.\n\nYou have to be a doer first. Now, that's not the same as saying that Vibe coding, prompt engineering won't be able to produce fully formed amazing systems even shortly. I think that's entirely possible. But then there's no skill left, which maybe is the greatest payoff at all. Wasn't that the whole promise of AI anyway, that it was just all natural language that even my clumsy way of formulating a question could result in a beautiful, succinct answer. That actually to me is a much more appealing vision that there's gonna be these special prompt engineering wizards who know how to tickle the AI just right to produce what they want. The beauty of AI is to think that someone who doesn't know the first thing about how AI actually works is able to formulate their idea and their aspirations for what they want, and the AI could somehow take that messy clump of ideas and produce something that someone wants.\n\nThat's actually what programming has always been. There's very often been people who didn't know how to program, who wanted programs, who then hired programmers, who gave them messy descriptions of what they wanted. And then when the programmers delivered that back said, oh no, actually that's not what I meant. I want something else. AI may be able to provide that cycle if that happens to the fullest extent of it. Yeah, there's not gonna be as many programmers around, right? But hopefully, presumably someone still, at least for the foreseeable future, have to understand whether what the AI is producing actually works or not. As\n\nA interesting case study, maybe a thought experiment. If I wanted to vibe code Basecamp or or Hay and some of the, some of the products you, you you've built, like what would be the bottle legs? What, what, where would I fail? Along the way,\n\nWhat I've seen when I've been trying to do this, trying to use Vibe coding to build something real is you actually failed really early. The Vibe coding is able to build a veneer at the current present moment of something that looks like it works, but it's flawed in all sorts of ways. There are the obvious ways, the meme, ways that it's leaking all your API keys, it's storing your password in plain text. I think that's ultimately solvable. Like it's gonna figure that out or at least it's gonna get better at that, but its capacity to get lost in its own labyrinth is very great right now. You let it code something and then you wanna change something and it becomes a game of whack-a-mole. Real quick, Peter Levels who've been doing this wonderful flight simulator was talking to that where at a certain scale, the thing just keeps biting its own tail.\n\nYou wanna fix something and it breaks five other things, which I think is actually uniquely human because that's how most bad programmers are at the certain level of complexity with the domain. They can't fix one thing without breaking three other things. So in that way I'm actually, in some way it's almost a positive signal for that. The AI's gonna figure this out because it's done an extremely human trajectory right now. The kind of mistakes it's making are the kind of mistakes that junior programmers make all the time. Yeah.\n\nCan we zoom out and look at the vision, the manifesto, the doctrine of Rails? What are some of the things that make a programming language a a framework? Great, especially for web development. So we talked about happiness. Yes. The underlying objective of Ruby. What else?\n\nSo you're looking at the nine points I wrote out in I think 2012 and first, before we dive into 'em, I wanna say the reason I wrote it down is that if you want a community to, you have to record its values and you have to record its practices. If you don't, eventually you're gonna get enough new people come in who have their own ideas of where this thing should go. And if we don't have a a guiding light helping us to make decisions, we're gonna start flailing. We're gonna start actually falling apart. I think this is one of the key reasons that institutions of all kinds start falling apart. We forget why Chesterton's fence is there. We just go like, why is that fence there?\n\nLet's yank it out. Oh, it was to keep the wolves out. Now we're all dead. Oops. So I wanted to write these things down and if we just take them quick one by one, you talked about optimizing for programmer happiness. I put that at number one in homage of mats, and that's a lot about accepting that there is occasionally a trade-off between writing Beautiful code and other things we want outta systems. There could be a runtime trade off, there can be a performance trade-off, but we're gonna do it nonetheless. We're also going to allow ambiguity in a way that many programmers by default are uncomfortable with. I give the example actually here of in the interactive Ruby Shell where you can play with the language or even interact with your domain model.\n\nYou can quit it in two ways, at least that I found. You can write exit, boom, you're outta the program, you can write quit, boom, you're outta the program. They do the same thing. We just wrote both exit or the people who built that wrote both Exit and quit because they knew humans were likely to pick one or the other. Python is the perfect contrast to this. In the Python interactive protocol, if you write exit, it won't exit. It'll give you a fucking lesson. It'll basically tell you to read the fucking manual. It says use exit parentheses or control DIE, end of file to exit. I'm like, one is very human and another is very engineer.\n\nAnd I mean that both of them in the best possible way, Python is pedantic python's. The value from the start stated is that there should be preferably one and only one way to do a certain thing. Ruby goes the complete opposite. No, we want the full expression that fits different human brains such that it seems like the language is guessing just what they want.\n\nAnd part of that is also you described the principle of Lisa Prize, which is a difficult thing to engineer into a language because you have to kind of, it's a subjective thing. What is,\n\nWhich is why you can't do it in one way, which is why I used the example of both Exit and Quit. The principle of Lisa Surprise for some people would be like, oh, exit. That's how I get out of the prompt. For other people it'd be quit. Why don't we just do both?\n\nOkay, so what's the convention over configuration? That's a big one.\n\nThat's a big one. That's a huge one. And it was born out of a frustration I had in the early days with especially Java frameworks, where when you were setting up a web application framework for Java back in the day, it was not uncommon to literally write hundreds if not thousands of lines of XML configuration files.",

      "transcript_chunk": "Have you ever found yourself agitated or confounded or just sick of the current state of affairs and wondered What It might be like to live in another time?\n\nI do not belong to this time period. I know it sounds crazy, but when I wore armor and I'm sitting in front of a castle in Germany or in Poland, I felt like I belonged there. You know, I I I feel at home\n\nFor some people. Home is in the Middle Ages.\n\nIt appears to be a simpler time. People worked hard and played hard. It seems exotic to us. Now\n\nThe exotic place these people are in is New Jersey at the Burlington County Fairgrounds. It's a warm sticky Sunday in June and they are attending the annual New Jersey Renaissance Fair, fair with an E at the end. Despite the heat, they're wearing woolen vests and long sleeved dresses, heavy boots also among the men, a lot of very bushy beards. Matt Schwarz is one of the musical performers. He is a harpist.\n\nI think nowadays you look at a world that doesn't have a lot of our modern problems and you think it was perfect. Of course back then they had their own problems. But I think there's much to be said with a world in which you're in touch with, with the outdoors in nature.\n\nJordan Cavalier is another musical performer.\n\nThis is called the Nickel Harpa. It's a Swedish key fiddle. It's 16 strings of medial Swedish glory. It has three melody strings, one drone string, and 12 sympathetic strings. I started playing six years ago and now I'm here refa playing it. This is like my life. Now,\n\nIn the US alone there are a couple hundred Renaissance fairs. Each year they give you a chance to hear period music, eat a Turkey leg or a giant pickle and pretend that you are not only in a different time, but that you are a different person.\n\nI am so Magan the Night of Fortitude, part of the night of Virtue, soon to fight in the Tournament of Virtue here at one 30 on the field.\n\nOkay, so there's two nights on like different horses on opposing sides and they're, they have like their jousting stick and they're trying to get the rings, so whichever one gets the rings, they get the point.\n\nAnother night Paul Mahaffey emerges from his jousting tournament, sweaty and winded.\n\nIt's almost been a year since I armored up and I love it. There's, it was exhausting, but I could do it again. In 10 minutes, the adrenaline gets going and you just get in there. It's just you and him. That's all you see. 'cause you can't see anything else in the helmet and it's great.\n\nOkay, so that's what they're all doing here. What are we doing here? When we set out to make a three part series about the arc of human life, we knew we would begin with birth and child rearing. That was last week's episode. You can catch up later if you missed it. We also knew that the final episode would be about aging and death, but what about the middle episode? We thought it would be interesting to explore what it's like to be middle Aged, but then you realize that our current concept of middle Aged is very new. At the beginning of the 20th century, average life expectancy was only 31 years old. Now that number on its own is misleading. There were plenty of old people and middle Aged people too, but the average was brought down by the incredibly high rate of child mortality.\n\nSo we got to wondering what was it like to be middle Aged back in the Middle Ages? And we asked the Renaissance fair attendees a simple question. If you could go back, would you go back?\n\nI'd rather be middle Aged in pretty much any century in the Middle Ages. That was rough, rough time.\n\nI would've not survived anything. No, I need like a Marriott, but I need like a JW Marriott. I don't even survive this when it rains.\n\nSo we have this thing today called ibuprofen that is a very, very powerful help to being middle Aged.\n\nSo that's how the Fairgoers feel today on Freakonomics Radio, we get an expert view on What It was like to be middle Aged in the Middle Ages. Ibuprofen not\n\nIncluded.\n\nThis is Freakonomics Radio, the podcast that explores the hidden side of everything with your host Steven Dubner.\n\nThe Middle Ages as agreed upon by most historians, cover the years from roughly 500 to 1500. Most historians also agree that renaissance fairs are not entirely accurate, so we decided to speak with a couple of actual historians.\n\nMy name is Nele Hja and I teach medieval history at Columbia University.\n\nHow would you describe generally your research interests?\n\nMy research interests are mostly in religious history of the Middle Ages, specifically history of Christianity. But because religion is so pervasive in the medieval world, basically every other type of history falls into the religious history that is social history, political history and everything. So I basically study everything.\n\nHow did you come to this particular concentration?\n\nMy story is a little bit unusual really, because I actually graduated from college as an industrial engineer. Oh,\n\nSorry. Yeah, that's a change.\n\nThat is a change. But then in the last year of engineering, I had read Umberto Echo's name of the Rose, and there I met for the first time the Franciscan order. What is special about Franciscan order is that they really wanted to be poor, very, very poor, poorer than everybody else. And I thought, who on earth might like to be poor? That seemed to me so strange, such a great contrast to modern life when everybody wants to be rich. I was very fascinated from the beginning with the monks and friars life now. I see a lot of problems in that kind of life that I didn't see before.\n\nFor instance,\n\nFor instance, no matter how hard they try, their passions and moral issues do not leave them. We think that the monks are calm and peaceful, dedicating their lives to God. But when you read the sources, it's not like that. They are very much acting. They\n\nCould be angry and horny.\n\nExactly. And corrupt and greedy.\n\nOkay, so that's Nestle shek, our first scholar of the Middle Ages. Let's meet the other one.\n\nMy name's Philip Schofield. I am a medieval historian at Abes with,\n\nThat's a university in Wales.\n\nMy main interests are in the broad air of economic history and I work particularly on peasantry.\n\nWhat would you say drew you to the study of peasantry?\n\nAs an undergraduate, I was really intrigued by the broad socioeconomic history that medievals, especially in France were doing, looking at the social structure of medieval villages.\n\nWhen I read about the work of archeologists and others who find physical evidence or ruins, it always seems a bit miraculous that things have survived from so long ago and yet it does happen. When you study economic history, I'm curious what the evidence is like and if it feels as though you're always reaching through a veil of sorts. Never quite getting to the reality.\n\nThat's always the sense. On one level, when I was doing my doctorate, I wrote at one stage something like, he probably thought that, and my supervisor, someone called Barbara Harvey, she said, what are you doing? You don't probably think it. You either know it or you don't know it, and if you don't know it, leave it out. That's sort of old school, but I it, it appeals to me really. I imagine if I walked through a 14th century peasant village on the basis of my understanding from 14th century records, there's undoubtedly a lot of things that would surprise me. But there are local court records, manorial records that are really the records generated by Lords, but include a huge amount of incidental information directed at the peasantry, including, for example, litigation.\n\nThat's something I work on quite a bit, is actually peasants not litigating with their lords, but peasants litigating with each other.\n\nI asked Philip Schofield if he was willing to imagine the daily life of a middle Aged peasant from that era, maybe a composite figure based on bits and pieces of schofield's research. He was actually able to do us one better than that.\n\nI did write something almost 30 years ago now in a journal called Past and Present about two peasants who litigated. So they're both real people and because they were extremely enthusiastic litigants, they tended to be more evident. And because they were relatively wealthy, they were also more evident and they also exist in taxation data. So that's the kind of person I would maybe go to.\n\nExcellent. Of these two peasant litigants, I need you to pick one that you can describe for us. Who would you prefer?\n\nI will pick someone called Robert, the son of Adam.\n\nOkay. Robert, the son of Adam. Where does he live?\n\nHe lived in a place called Hindu Clay in Suffolk.\n\nAnd what year would you like to place Robert, the son of Adam in Hindu clay. That would count as his middle age,\n\nLet's say about 1305. I hope he's not dead by then. He was certainly active around that time and was doing pretty well.\n\nHow old is he?\n\nI would say he was probably in his thirties.\n\nAnd that counts as middle Aged then?\n\nI think so, yeah. I was thinking about this today and what I know about calculations of life expectancy, most of that is really hard to do from the records I've describing, but it's really monastic evidence from the 15th century where you've got a whole range of moments in amongst life in places like Westminster Abbey and Durham, cathedral, priory and so on. And then you can follow them through various administrative tasks and then often they end up in the infirmary and their desks are recorded. The estimates for that tend to suggest that life expectancy is taking people into the late forties. 50.\n\nOkay. We will return later to Robert, son of Adam, a relatively wealthy peasant in hinder Clay, England. I asked Nestle Shaza who grew up in Turkey, what it's like to really immerse yourself in medieval history.\n\nIt gives you perspective, it gives you an alternative. It takes you out of the bubble, which is modern life. When we grow up, we are born into this life. We sometimes think that this is the only way things could be, but it could have been another way.\n\nSo if I asked you to switch places with someone from that period, would you be would willing or interested?\n\nIf I'm going to have my kids with me, yes. If certain conditions are met, I guess I would, yeah. 'cause it's a much simpler life. I'd like to be an artisan in a city, I guess. Mm.\n\nWhat would you make?\n\nStained glass would be nice. I mean, stained glass is so beautiful. People in the Middle Ages had their shops actually inside their homes, so I don't have to even go somewhere else.\n\nWhere exactly would you choose to live?\n\nLet's make it Italy.\n\nIn a city or rural?\n\nIt has to be a city, really. Italian cities were much more advanced in the 13th century. Much better organized. You have free healthcare, free education. If I'm rural than I would have to be peasant.\n\nAnd you want to be an artisan? Yes,\n\nI'd rather be an artisan. I think being a peasant requires far too much energy, which I don't think I have.\n\nLet's start with the city. Where will you live?\n\nWell, I quite like Florence, so it would have to be Florence.\n\nWhat year shall we pick? 12?\n\nFifties would be good\n\nIn real life today. Do you have a spouse or partner?\n\nI do have a spouse, yes. And he's Italian actually.\n\nSo Nestle shek has raised the stakes by including herself in our exercise and she's bringing along her husband and two sons. I asked Philip Scofield what we know about the family of Robert, the son of Adam.\n\nHe's got a brother. Beyond that, it's difficult to be entirely sure. We do know from other contemporaries that if he was fairly typical, he would have a wife and maybe a small number of surviving children, some of whom would survive into adulthood. So it's quite reasonable to suppose that he had three or four children who moved beyond infancy.\n\nWhat do his children do? At what age do they start to perhaps work with him? Well,\n\nThey were still really young, you know, less than 10. So small scale herding, managing crops, keeping birds off things, helping with harvest and so on.\n\nWhat level of education would these kids be getting?\n\nEducation is fairly limited. A lot of education is the education of the village in a sense of learning from doing in some ways. What\n\nDoes Robert eat and drink?\n\nThe bulk of his diet would've been predominantly grain-based, but leavened by fish, both sea fish and fresh water. Fish, maybe a little bit of meat, probably bacon, but also poultry. Quite a lot of ale in his diet.\n\nIs there a relatively low alcohol version of ale that children and others would drink since it was safer than water? I mean\n\nChildren are drinking ale, definitely. Whether it's low alcohol or not, it's difficult to be entirely sure.\n\nObviously in Florence you would have access to very good wine. What\n\nWould a family dinner look like?\n\nIt would definitely have vegetables and fruit. Meat is a little bit more problematic for medieval people 'cause it's expensive. Pork and chicken would be cheaper than beef, so we might have that maybe once a week. People did consume a lot of beans and lentils and things like that. Also because they were durable, they don't go bad. We wouldn't obviously have any fridge or anything, not even a cellar. But also, of course the main staple of any diet is the bread.\n\nSay a bit more about why you are determined to put yourself in a city and not a village or the countryside.\n\nThe big difference is that you are much less exposed to the elements. City life is pretty safe compared to the rural life because the cities are walled. They're very well protected in the countryside. You do get raid, you might have animals coming in, wild animals, which were much more in number in the Middle Ages than they are now. Obviously they've been hunted down over the years. There is food insecurity in the countryside. I wouldn't have food insecurity because generally what the medieval cities like Florence did, they had big granaries. They stored grain just in case there's famine and then they would distribute it to the citizens.\n\nLet's talk about the state of commerce. How does that work? How much do you make and what are you able to buy with it?\n\nI would have to find commissioned jobs. If I'm a stain glass maker, that would mean either a church or a monastery would have to gimme orders. There are lots of churches, many more than now. And if a church can afford having stained glass, which would be expensive, I think I can make decent amount of money to be what corresponds today to middle class.\n\nOkay, so you're a middle class, middle Aged artisan in the Middle Ages. Yes.\n\nThat's a lot of middle.\n\nThat's okay. That's why we're here. What is it like to be a freelance artisan then?\n\nWell, the thing is I would have to enter the guilt of stained glass makers. All the trades were very well organized. Today's trade unions, they really have their origins in the Middle Ages, so I would have to pay dues to my gu. I would have to be registered as a master of state class, and the amount of money I can charge would be regulated by them.\n\nWhen you read economic history, the economists are usually anti guild because they see guilds as monopolistic within their domain. There was actually this famous economic essay about how the Candlemakers guild were trying to have a resolution passed that forbade the sun from shining at certain times because with too much sunlight there was less demand for their products plainly. That was not quite real, but the sentiment I think was legitimate. I'm curious, how would you feel about your guild? Would you feel it's generally a positive for you and for the rest of society, positive for you and a negative for the others, and maybe even negative for you because you have to join this guild and pay dues and have your wages probably set as opposed to being a true freelancer?\n\nWell, I'm not inflicted with the aire ideas of the modern economy, which I consider a good thing. The guild is a very good thing for the people inside it. (1)",

      "transcript_chunk": "Hey there, it's S Steven Dubner. We just republished a three-part series called Everything You Never Knew About Whaling. We spoke with economists, historians, Moby Dick Scholar, and an environmental activist whose mission in life is to stop whale hunting. We also tried to speak with a whale hunter, but public sentiment against whaling is so strong that most modern whalers don't wanna speak with the press. Also, there just aren't that many whalers around anymore. In the 1960s, at the peak of industrial whale hunting, thousands of whalers in more than a dozen countries were killing tens of thousands of whales a year. Today commercial whaling happens in only three countries, Norway, Iceland, and Japan.\n\nAnd collectively they only kill about a thousand whales a year. There just isn't much demand for whale meat, it turns out, and even less for whale oil. Anyway, we couldn't get a modern whaler to go on the record with us, but then right as we were finishing our series, we landed our white whale, Bjorn Anderson, one of the biggest whalers in Norway. The Norwegian government allows for the harvest of 1400 minka whales a year. The minka is plentiful. It's not at all an endangered species. Even so, Anderson and his fellow whalers usually take less than half of the allowed quota each year. Like I said, just not much demand for whale meat these days.\n\nWhen we caught up with Anderson back in 2023, he just finished his whaling season. In the conversation you're about to hear, he tells us why he loves hunting whales and how he does it. Why harvesting whales is important to maintaining the supply of fish and why he thinks that in the future there will be more whale hunting and not less. It's coming up on this bonus episode of Freakonomics Radio starting now.\n\nThis is Freakonomics Radio, the podcast that explores the hidden side of everything with your host Steven Dubner.\n\nOkay, Bjorn, it's Steven. You can hear me okay?\n\nYes, I hear you.\n\nI'm sorry to interrupt your holiday. Yes, you're on holiday in Sweden.\n\nYes, I am outside. So the home in the middle of Sweden, we have to go to my wife's home place.\n\nAnd what do you do when you're there on holiday?\n\nCutting grass.\n\nDo you do any fishing?\n\nNo, it's holiday\n\nNow. Where in Norway do you live\n\nIn Lofo? In the Westly part of Lofo. On the water we live on small islands.\n\nIs that where you grew up?\n\nYes.\n\nDid you grow up in a fishing family?\n\nYes, my father was a fisherman and a whale hunter.\n\nAnd can you tell me about your work now you're mostly a fisherman and then you whale. During the whale season\n\nIn 1st of January we start fishing cold. When it comes to spring April or something like that, we start Mickey whale hunting and that go on to the summer. After summer we go to shipyard to repair and fix the boat, and in the autumn we fish herring.\n\nSo of the three things that you catch mostly cod, whale and herring, which makes you the most money?\n\nIt depends. Cod and herring are this year the best.\n\nHow was your whale season this year? How many whales did you get?\n\n111 whale.\n\nWow. Holy cow. So you alone are responsible for like 25% of all the whales taken in Norway this year? Yeah. Yeah. So 111, how many trips was that?\n\nFour trips.\n\nCan you describe how you sell it then? Who do you sell it to?\n\nWell, it's company I'm co-owner in and then we distribute it to all the Norway to the stores. So they export some whale to Japan.\n\nOne thing that confuses me is I read that the Norwegian quota for minka whale in a year is a thousand, but that all of you collectively, all the whalers only take like five or 600 in a year. So why are you not getting up to the quota? Is it just not worth it? Are there not enough whalers?\n\nIt's a problem to distribute and get it in the store everywhere and people have to buy it.\n\nWhat about the price of whale me over the past few years? It goes up, it goes down. Where is it?\n\nNo, it's going up but not in that speed. We want the price of wame have rise every year almost, but not enough. It's about one third or one fourth of our income.\n\nDoes the government subsidize fishing and whaling?\n\nNo.\n\nNot at all. No. Are there any price guarantees for the fish or the whale that you catch?\n\nYes. All fisheries in Norway have a a guarantee minimum price. It's regulated by law.\n\nIs it usually sold for more than that anyway?\n\nYes. Often it's over there minimum price.\n\nBut the minimum price is useful to you just in case the prices fall? Yeah,\n\nIt's useful for everybody because you don't have those ups and downs. Everybody are jealous on our fishermen today because it has been quite good to be a fisherman in the last 20 years now because we have had quite good quotas and good money.\n\nSo what would happen to you if Norway decided that they don't want to allow anyone to hunt whales anymore?\n\nIf they do, they are crazy. Some years from now there will be no code or no herring to fish because there are so many whales. That's the food for the whale. Mickey whale is a opportunist. We eat even salmon and cold and herring and everything. If you hunt whale, you can fish more fish because you have the balance in the ecosystem.\n\nDo you know how many Mka whales there are in the world?\n\nThe latest number is 150,000\n\nIn the world,\n\nNot in the world. In the North Atlantic.\n\nI saw a number, this was a few years ago that said there were maybe half a million of Antarctic mka stocks. Does anyone talk about the mka whale as endangered at all?\n\nThat must be people who don't know anything about the sea. Because if you are going to the coast of northern and Trumps and Finmark, you can see Minky whale and humpback and fin whale all the spring and summer in the autumn. If you number out how much minke whale eat, if there are 150,000 minky whales, it'll be about 50 to 60,000 ton each day of fish they have study the number of how much the sea animal including birds and everything eats in a year.\n\nIt's 25 million tons of food and the fishermen only take 4 million tons.\n\nWhen you get the whale, you kill the, you bring the whale on board the boat and you open up the stomach. What do you find in the stomach of a minka whale?\n\nEverything. It could be Solomon, it could be cold, it could be hurry.\n\nWhat does a modern day whaler think of the save the whales movement. It's coming up. I'm Steven Dubner. This is Freakonomics Radio. We'll be right back.\n\nPandora (9m 21s):\nFinding the music you love shouldn't be hard.

That's one 800 flowers.com/pandora.\n\nOkay, I'm Steven Dubner. Let's get back to my conversation with Bjorn Anderson, a Norwegian fisherman and whale hunter. So do you think the save the whales movement that started in the 1970s, do you think it's gone too far? That there are too many whales that are eating too much of the fish supply that people eat?\n\nYes. It'll come to that soon.\n\nSo when someone says to you, Bjorn, I like whales, I don't want any whales to be killed, what do you say to them?\n\nNo, I don't like to kill them. It's for food. A mke whale is very close related to a cow because the mke whale has four stomach. So I cannot see any difference to kill a cow or killer, a mke whale.\n\nThe the entire commercial whaling industry, Norway, Japan, Iceland, wherever kills only about a thousand whales a year. But hundreds of thousands of whales are dying every year from plastic pollution and noise pollution and boat strikes, and most of all from getting caught up in fishing gear. But it seems that most of the protests by environmental activists is directed at you at the commercial whalers. Why do you think that is?\n\nIt's a human's bad conscious due to environmental stuff.\n\nDo you consider yourself an environmentalist?\n\nYes.\n\nDo you think of yourself as a conservationist?\n\nYes. I think it's common sense. If you harvest nature, you have to make sure that there are growing up things to hunt or to harvest next year.\n\nSo what do you say to someone who thinks that they are being a perfect moral person? Right, and says that no one should ever kill whales.\n\nGet some understanding of the nature. It's simple like that. They don't understand the nature. They believe more on Walt Disney or something like that. I have not so much to say about that because I am just fed up with them. They're also wrong in many, many places. Stop the plastic pollution we have now. They should have work for stopping plastic pollution many, many years ago. And even petrol, the global warming is also a a big issue. We don't know what's happening in the years to come.\n\nThey should have done more work on those. Issue has really become a problem for us. Minky whale or whale hunting is not a problem. It was a problem for the whale some year, so many years ago. Now it's no problem with the whale stock.\n\nDo you think the International Whaling Commission did a good job years ago when they tried to regulate the number of whales that could be killed?\n\nThey didn't do their job.\n\nWhy not?\n\nThey are a organization based on the scientific comte and the scientific Comte said there was enough mke whale. So they should have given out quota on Mke whale, but they didn't.\n\nSo what would happen if everyone in the world were allowed to hunt MCO whale starting next year? Would that be a problem for the MCO whale population?\n\nOf course you have to do a regulation, you have to count them. You have to give out quota and and do it sustainable.\n\nI've read that whalers wanted the fisheries ministry in Norway to promote whaling and wail me, but that it didn't work. That they were worried that trading partners would get upset. Do you know anything about that?\n\nYes, I was one of those who wanted to him to respond on that, but he didn't.\n\nHave you ever been to the US Bjorn?\n\nYes.\n\nWhere did you go?\n\nNew York.\n\nYeah, that's where I am. Did you like New York?\n\nYes, because I study engineering, high power electricity engineering. So we was visit Con Edison in New York.\n\nAnd you were working as an engineer then?\n\nYes.\n\nWho did you work for?\n\nNo, K. It was a power plant. Yes, we produced about 3% of Norwegian electricity.\n\nSo why did you stop working as an engineer and become a full-time fisherman?\n\nIt's a much better way of life. You are free and you are out. You can see the nature, you can see whales, you can see other fish, and you can feel the weather, bad weather or good weather in a much better way than you do in the office.\n\nWhen you came to New York, did you go into the rural areas at all or just the city?\n\nNo, we were just in New York.\n\nOkay. So if you had gone upstate into New York, you would see a lot of deer. And in the US some species of deer are considered a nuisance animal for a lot of reasons. They eat crops, they spread disease, they cause car crashes. And so hunting of deer is encouraged. There's a season and there's a limit. Do you see the mka whale as sort of a nuisance animal like that?\n\nNo. It's a source of food, but you have to try to balance the ecosystem as good as you can because then it'll produce the most. We have to harvest our resources in a sensible way. If you don't shoot well, the ecosystem will collapse sooner or later\n\nAfter the break. How exactly does Bjorn Anderson harvest those resources? You\n\nHave to think like a whale.\n\nI'm Steven Dubner. This is Freakonomics Radio. We'll be right back.\n\nSmartless (16m 49s):\nHey, this is Will Anette, host of Smartless.

How big is the ship? What's it called?\n\nThe boat is called Buen and it's a 32 meter long steel boat.\n\nAnd the name of the boat Buen. What does that mean?\n\nMy father was grown up on Rena. It's a place in Fulton, Rena Boen. It's like a man who lived on that place.\n\nDid you grow up wanting to be a whaler when you were a kid?\n\nYes, I was five years. First time I saw a while was shot. I it was very excited.\n\nWhy did you get talked into becoming an engineer then?\n\nThey both stopped in the whale hunting. So yeah, I didn't know what to do.\n\nThis was in 1986 when the International Whaling Commission put a moratorium on commercial whaling. But in 1992, Norway announced it would resume hunting minko whales In defiance of that ban Anderson, who was by then working as an engineer for a power company, was able to get back to his first love.\n\nI think that was a very good decision because the culture and the know-how starting to disappear and it could be very hard for the coastal people here in Norway.\n\nDo you have kids Bjorn?\n\nNo.\n\nDo you have young crew members that are going to become like you? A whaling boat captain?\n\nYes. They just finished school and they started to onboard a ship and learn to catch whale or fish. Some are good or some are bad. Yeah,\n\nYeah, yeah. You're good.\n\nYes. My father alerted me everything. You have to have a good interest in what you're doing and it's whatever you do. If you don't have the interest, you will be not so good.\n\nWhat about the crew size on your boat?\n\nWe are six people all year.\n\nThey work for you year round the same six?\n\nYeah.\n\nDo they live in your town\n\nNearby?\n\nWhat's the longest you've ever gone from land then?\n\n2, 3, 4 weeks? We have been on the north side of Bergen, almost 81 degrees north.\n\nWhen you're out on the water, can you describe how you locate the minka whale?\n\nWe only use our eyes.\n\nWow. No sonar, nothing like that? (1)",

      "transcript_chunk": "dit is that it applies only to employees who spend at least 80% of their time in a customer facing role. So a restaurant can pool their tips and distribute them among the wait staff, bartenders and hostesses, but not the kitchen crew.\n\nI might think twice if I believe that the legislature was going to create a new law that permitted tips to be shared everywhere. That has not happened. But even if they did do that, it would still lead me to say this is not a professional way to treat people. Tipping in and of itself I don't think fosters the professionalism that we're looking for in our industry. If you think about every industry where tipping happens, it's often not a full-time career. I don't tip my airline pilot or my lawyer or my teacher or the person who's interviewing me on their podcast. That's a profession\n\nPodcasting a profession. Anyway, for all these reasons, Danny Meyer decided to eliminate tipping at all his restaurants.\n\nWe've converted about one every four to six months. We just have one more to go.\n\nOkay, so let's talk about what you've learned.\n\nWell, I think the biggest thing we've learned is that this is really tough and it's tough because it's really a three legged stool that we're trying to balance. How do you create a menu price that doesn't frighten away a prospective customer who's just casually looking up your restaurant online and may not understand that there will be no tipping on top of that? And then did you actually compensate your team to the degree that you hope to? And now the third leg of the stool is, did you actually make enough money to cover all of the costs involved?\n\nWhat can you tell us about your restaurant revenues before and after hospitality included?\n\nWell, I can tell you that our revenues are decidedly higher, but keep in mind we started charging 21% more roughly on all of our prices. So if they were not at least 21% higher, that would be a big fail. What I can also tell you is that the compensation for our staff members, both formerly tipped employees and never tipped employees, has also gone up quite a bit.\n\nSo if one of the goals was to even out the pay between the people cooking the food and the people serving the food, how much have you closed that gap?\n\nHere's what I know, Steven. The earning potential before we started hospitality included was 2.4 times more for tipped employees than for back of the house employees. Today it's 1.9 times more, so that's big. I can also say that the line cook wages, so the people who cook your food have gone up 37%. Front of house compensation formerly tipped employees has gone up 8%. So we've been able to increase both, but we've obviously in order to make some headway in terms of this discrepancy, have have increased back of the house pay by a lot more.\n\nRight, and and what's that mean in actual dollar terms for kitchen versus wait staff? Maybe you could use the modern as your example.\n\nWhen we started hospitality included in the aggregate, the front of the house employees at the modern were making somewhere around $22 an hour. And today that number is about $25 an hour. Believe it or not, a cook in the aggregate in 2015 was making just over $11 an hour. Today they're in 16 and a half dollars an hour. So that's a serious, serious hike.\n\nMeyer didn't share with us any profitability figures, so we don't know the degree to which these higher wages are eating into the restaurant's bottom lines, but at least in terms of wages, the hospitality included model sounds like it's working. Kitchen wages went up a lot, even wait, staff wages went up a little on average, but not everybody likes to be average.\n\nWhenever we've converted a restaurant, we would experience as much as a 30 to 40% turnover in our legacy staff. And I completely understand why that is, because the way that you got a raise in a tipped house was to have stayed at the restaurant longer than anyone else, which meant that you got the lucrative Thursday, Friday, Saturday night shifts, you know, and it may have taken you six or seven or eight years to earn that schedule,\n\nBut the new no tipping model made those shifts relatively less valuable, which for shorter tenured workers was a positive.\n\nOne of the real benefits is that you can make as much money working on a Monday night is on a Friday night because the way we compensate our team is a higher hourly rate, plus a revenue share model that averages out the entire week.\n\nAnd there was another benefit.\n\nI feel great about the fact that I no longer need to worry that the only way to get a great tip is to have a woman subjecting herself to leering men. Or if I'm from a different ethnic group than the table that I'm serving, that I need to worry that they're not gonna give me a good tip.\n\nBut if you think you hear a hint of disappointment in Meyer's voice, well, I'm not sure that's what we're hearing, but when he set out to eliminate tipping, he thought he was starting a revolution.\n\nYeah, well, we did not succeed at inspiring an entire industry to change its tune.\n\nThe no tipping initiative got a ton of media coverage. It was easy to think that a lot of restaurants were following suit.\n\nNot as many restaurants have moved away from tipping as you would get. The impression\n\nThat again is Michael Lin, the Cornell Tipping Scholar in\n\nThe seventies and eighties. There was a comparable tendency for a couple of restaurateurs that got a lot of press for it to eliminate tipping, and some of them survived and continued that policy, but the vast majority ended going back to tipping.\n\nDanny Meyer gets that.\n\nI've been pretty zealous about how I think tipping actually holds people back. But I also understand that movements happen in a big way when the economics work for everybody. And I don't think we're quite there yet. I completely understand it's not working yet for everybody.\n\nIf you were just having the idea today, having gone through what you've gone through the first few years of trying it, would you try it again or would you consider this an experiment in progress that while noble and smart, et cetera, et cetera is maybe too difficult that there's too much status quo overturn?\n\nWell, I think that's a fair question and the honest answer is I'm not sure. I think largely because of some of the notoriety of our making this initiative that has actually brought an awareness to the legislature, which is getting very, very close as I understand, to creating a situation where tips can be shared amongst everybody.\n\nWe conducted this interview in 2019 and New York State law has not changed since then. But even if it does and if back of house workers were to get a share of tips, it probably wouldn't eliminate tipping, might even strengthen the status quo. But Danny Meyer sees another development that might force a big change\n\nEach time. Minimum wage goes up, restaurants that are continuing to have a tipping system have all raised their prices to keep up with the minimum wage increases and then the guest is tipping 20% on top of that. So we're about one minimum wage hike away from a pricing advantage over other restaurants while we're paying our staff more. And I think that's the point when you're gonna start to see many, many restaurants eliminate tipping.\n\nA few months after my conversation with Danny Meyer, the pandemic shut down the entire restaurant industry. When Meyer's Restaurants reopened in July of 2020, the no tipping policy was no longer in effect. We don't know how often people will be eating out. Meyer told the New York Times, we do know that guests want to tip generously right now. Michael Lin at Cornell who once told us he would like to ban tipping, he is not so sure we will ever see the end. Why? Look,\n\nWhen I started doing research on tipping, I thought tips would be strongly related to service quality. But what I found was that about 4% of the variance in tips left by different groups can be explained by their ratings of service quality\n\nThat is in restaurants as in the tipping of Uber drivers. There was a weak correlation between quality of service and tip. But Lynn discovered something interesting in his research. A lot of restaurant servers think there's a strong correlation. About\n\nHalf of the servers in this country will say that they think their tips are moderately to strongly affected by the service they leave. They're wrong when they say that, but they believe it and because they believe it. Tipping in fact does provide an incentive to deliver better service for at least half of the servers in this country. So yes, my opinion about the incentive value of tipping as a system of compensation has changed over time. Although the facts haven't changed, I just learned more about it and begin to think a little bit more sophisticated about it.\n\nOkay. Did you follow that? Waiters and waitresses think their service significantly affects their tip even though the data shows it doesn't. But because waiters and waitresses think it does, they act as if it does. And Michael Lin found a similar dynamic from the customer side.\n\nTipping increases customer satisfaction. Customers expect service to be better under a tipping system and that can bias their perceptions. I've done a couple of studies based upon recent restaurants that have eliminated tipping. So for example, Joe's Crab Shack recently at several of its restaurants eliminated tipping. Most of them went back to tipping. Their online service ratings declined during the period that they had no tipping and went back up when they reinstituted tipping.\n\nDoes that mean the service actually got worse when there was no tipping?\n\nI don't know. I can't nail down precisely why it occurred. I believe it has to do with customers expect service to be better. I know that customers generally like lower prices and Joe's Crab Shack, when it eliminated tipping, it raised its prices.\n\nThis suggests that many restaurant customers are price sensitive and that they're so accustomed to seeing menus carrying a preti price that they'd prefer to see the low price and then tip, even though they'll end up paying the same or even more. The human mind is a funny thing, is it not? I'm\n\nLess likely to want to just ban tipping now because the data I have suggests that customers are happier with tipping. The press mostly focuses on this from the standpoint of servers, but by far the largest group that's impacted by tipping is customers. As much as people might grouse about tipping overall, it seems to increase consumer satisfaction. And since they outnumber employees by a wide margin, likely it's in society's benefit.\n\nSo Michael Lynn's research suggests that Danny Meyer's no tipping revolution will have to wait even longer. But Lynn's research did identify one category of restaurant that's ready for the transition,\n\nAnd that is really upscale restaurants that replace tipping with higher menu prices.\n\nAny examples,\n\nDanny Meyer's restaurants fall in that category. I think that the price sensitivity of his customers is lower. I also think that he's got a strong enough reputation that people won't anticipate lower service quality. It's a Danny Meyers restaurants. People will still expect good service even if there is no tipping.\n\nSo what have we learned other than the fact that tipping is among the most unpredictable economic activities on earth? I went back to John List to ask whether his research on Uber tipping says anything larger about the human condition.\n\nI think a first point that the data really highlight is that very few people will be continuously generous and consistently generous. I think that that just jumps out in the data. I think a broader point number two is the heterogeneity across people. You know, we oftentimes have people talking about, you know, well everyone's different, but we actually have a really good glimpse of an important part of our economy. And it shows you just how important things, like if you are a nice person and you get a nice rating that that spills over to this generosity that you can exhibit privately.\n\nI think that's sort of interesting because in psychology and in economics we found that a lot of behaviors don't spill over to different areas in our lives. So you know, you smoke, but then you wear a seatbelt. You're nice in one setting, but you're mean in the other. This sort of gives you a glimpse that there's some consistency in this generosity or being nice to another person that is much stronger than what I've seen in the past.\n\nJohn, what kind of a tipper are you?\n\nI'm an always tipper. I'm the 1%.\n\nAnd why is that? Is it that you want to give some of your money to those people or is it that you want to be for yourself, the kind of person who does that?\n\nI think it's both. I think that this is an important time to send wealth or income to another person who's doing a job such as this. But I also feel good about doing it. I have a warm glow and it makes me feel good inside that I'm not stiffing the person if\n\nJohn List is telling the truth and I have no reason to think he's not. This is interesting that an economist of all people always tips. Economists famous for knowing, as it said, the price of everything and the value of nothing. Economists who lecture the rest of us about utility and profit maximizing, about putting aside our pesky emotions when it's time to make a decision.\n\nI have a warm glow.\n\nA warm glow. The fact that an economist like John List always tips is I believe the best possible evidence of just how weird tipping truly is.

      "transcript_chunk": "ed Egyptian Islamic Jihad and what was called then the Islam Group, which was the main group that was controlled by the Saudi Intelligence Services during the 1980s.\n\nAnd that was the thing that United States wanted.\n\nYes. So Big Bruins was trying to debate Russia into invade Soviet Union into invading Afghanistan. And then they wanted to extend the war. So America had to deal with Saudi Arabia, we would match them dollar for dollar, and we would work with their intelligence services and the Pakistanis to support local mujahideen like Guine Mja and Jalal Dean Haqqani, who later became America's enemies in our Afghan war. But then, and, and various other pian warlords of different descriptions. Wait, so\n\nUS is essentially helping train up these militia groups.\n\nYes. And including bringing them to the United States and having our special forces train them in car bombs and sabotage and assassinations and everything. Yes. Full scale US support for building up the Bin Laden night movement. As long as they're killing Soviets.\n\nAnd those same people then come back and become the enemies in the\n\nUnited States. That's right. So when we talk about Al-Qaeda, what we're talking about is eventually the merger of Egyptian Islamic Jihad and the Azam Group after Azam was killed. And I don't think anybody really knows who killed him. Osama Bin Laden took over his group and Osama Bin Laden. So then this is the main reason, and there are many, this is the main reason that Alqaeda turned against the United States, was that Sabin la was outraged that the king had allowed the United States to liberate Kuwait instead of him and his men. It's not like they have a bunch of mountains to hide out in, in Kuwait, but he wanted to try it to, to kick Saddam out. And then he was just driven crazy by the fact that the king allowed white Christian combat forces to come and occupy this holy land.\n\nIt's not just their country, but their holy land. Where Mecca Medina, the birthplace of Muhammad and the birthplace of the religion of Islam are, and the, the two holy places, Bin Laden called them. I guess they all do. And that then we didn't leave. This is the ultimate outrage, right? And this is the main overriding reason for the Bin Laden night, well, at least for his jihad, which was really based on the idea of trying to get all the disparate groups from around the Middle East. These are more or less stateless groups. They're in some cases backed by Saudi, you know, more or less at different times. But they're jihadists from all over the place. You know, Egyptians and Saudis and Syrians and, and you know, Azam himself was Palestinian, raised in a refugee camp in Kuwait, but yet all these different people.\n\nAnd then, so Bin Laden's genius was to figure out, the one thing we can agree on is let's attack the United States because America is at the root of all of our problems. And just like we had helped them to bog the Soviets down in Afghanistan, they wanted to do the same thing to us. And so this was the beginning, really, of Al-Qaeda's war against the United States began at this time in reaction to the declaration of this new world order, the permanent stationing of troops in Saudi Arabia. And what became the permanent, the unrelenting, full global embargo, United Nations Security Council, full global sanctions regime against the Iraqi state, which led to, at the very least 300,000 excess deaths.\n\nAlthough a UN study later embellished that. And Bin Laden would embellished the numbers even higher than that to 600,000 or a million. But whatever it was, it was a ruthless economic war of collective punishment against the entire people of the country, even though they had their chance to overthrow him. USA encouraged it and then let Saddam keep his helicopters and tanks while we were standing right there and let him crush the insurrection. Now the Bush administration and later the Clinton administration's position was the sanction stay until Saddam is gone. But he is still young and in pretty good health, and no one in Iraq is in any position to do anything about this. So is just this, the policy that Clinton inherited from Bush and ended up keeping,\n\nCan we Go to, can you link on Bin Laden? Sure. So this gave enough fuel for Bin Laden to construct a narrative where America, that's\n\nRight, the bad guys. And, and this is such an important thing, there's this great book by Michael Schroer, who was the former chief of the CIA Bin Laden unit. It's called Imperial Hubris. And I will say that he went a bit crazy in later years and said really mean things like, we ought to help all the Muslims kill each other and we ought to have a civil war over Russiagate. And which I'm very, very opposed to Russiagate Lex, but I wouldn't go that far. So he went a little nuts later on, but he's a very bright guy and and a very honest guy for what it's worth. A very straightforward guy, I should say. I don't know if he is ever told a lie or what\n\nHero hubris, why the West is losing the war on terror. Yeah. By Michael Schu. And I should also say, echoing that statement that some of the smartest people I know are walking the line between genius and madness.\n\nIt happens.\n\nAnd, and when you study the dark aspects of human nature and, and geopolitics, sometimes it's easy to lose yourself in the madness.\n\nYeah, that's totally true. But so in this book, he makes it so clear, there are six overriding reasons that Bin Laden cited for why the United States should be attacked. Okay? And he compared this directly to the Aya Khomeini who would relentlessly criticize our culture and, you know, licentiousness and Hollywood R rated ness and all of that kind of stuff as like the degenerate society. But he can't recruit people for a war over that. You know what I mean? Not that he's really trying to, but that only inspires, inspires so much resentment. You know, and conservatives don't like of libertinism, right?\n\nLike that's okay, but it only goes so far. Right? Bin Laden on the other hand said they occupy the land of the two holy places. They help Israel kill Palestinians and Lebanese. They support the dictators, especially in Saudi Arabia and Egypt. But around the Middle East, they put pressure on those dictators to keep oil prices artificially low to subsidize our economy at their expense. Just think of all the times you've heard president say, I'm telling the Saudis they better ramp up production and get the price of gas down for election day. Right? As blatant as can be. But what does that sound like to the poor person in those countries, isn, that money's supposed to Go to them. And then as Bin Laden would say, falsely turning a blind eye to Russia, India, Kazakhstan, and China in their persecution of Muslims.\n\nSo they say they love us so much, but they don't really, 'cause they don't say anything when this group or that group are the ones killing us. So these were the things, and look, let us stipulate Lex, okay, that Osama Bin Laden is a mass murderer. And by tradition, I don't take the word of mass murderers for meaning very much. And I don't expect you to, okay? That's not the point. The point is, what did he say that got anybody to listen to him and do what he said? He was in charge of a government. He had no coercive apparatus at all. His organization is purely volunteer, volunteer based. And he's asking people to blow themselves up over something important enough to blow yourself up for it.\n\nAnd it's not virgins. It's, we have a policy, I should stipulate virgins after you die. It was, we have a policy and we're trying to provoke a war with the United States of America and you're gonna help us do it. Why? 'cause of these six reasons. That's why. And that was what worked to recruit people to attack the United States of America. Okay, major important case in point and oh, whatever the timeline jumps around here a bit. But major case in point is in 1996 when Israel under Shimon Perez Inva rein invaded Lebanon in what was called Operation Grapes of Wrath.\n\nAnd during that invasion, it's hard to believe this, wait, don't, don't Google yet search this part. It was Naftali Bennett called in the artillery strike on a un shelter and killed 106 women in children in Kana. That's QANA. In 1996,\n\nNAF Bennett, while serving as an Israeli army officer in 1996, commanded a commando unit during Operation Grapes of Wrath in Southern and Lebanon. During this operation, his troops came under mortar fire near the village of Kana Bennett radioed for artillery support, so on and so on and so on. Killing 106 people and injured many others\n\nIn a un shelter.\n\nThis humanitarian tragedy is widely known as the Kahna Massacre.\n\nSo when Shimon Perez launched that war, Muhammad Atta the ringleader of the September 11th plotters in the United States pilot of Flight 11, I believe he and his buddy Ramsey Benal, she, they were Egyptian engineering students studying in Hamburg, Germany. And when this invasion started, they both signed their last will and testament, which their friends and family and neighbors and whatever said was their expressed intent that like they're joining the army, they're deciding, forget engineering, I want to join the Muja Dean and go fight the good fight somewhere, whatever. Then just a couple of months later, Bin Laden put out his first declaration of war against the United States.\n\nIt's called Declaration of War against the Americans occupying the land of the two holy places. Pretty subtle, right? And then on the first page, he goes on and on about the Kana massacre and says, we'll never forget the, the severed heads and arms and legs of the babies and the children in Kana. He told Robert Fisk, I believe, how come our how come your blood is blood, but our blood is water? Well, we'll see about that. That's\n\nA strong reminder that there's a cost to killing people.\n\nOh yeah. So what happened was Muhammad Atta and Ramsey Alb, they read that Declaration of War and that was when they decided to join Al-Qaeda was based on the Kana mare that Israel had perpetrated in Lebanon. So again, we're skipping ahead in the story, we're gonna do the whole nineties here. But literally on September 11th, you had Egyptians volunteered for a Saudi sheik to slaughter Americans by the thousands as revenge for American support for Israel killing people in Lebanon. That my friend, is why George Bush said they hate the Taliban. Did it because they hate your freedom. Right? Because I couldn't tell you that\n\n106 people, it's a reminder that killing can cause immeasurable escalation, trillions of dollars, all of it.\n\nAnd here's the other thing, bill Clinton, I think foolishly said something about how he would like to normalize relations with Iraq, or at least look into it or something. And boy, he should not have said that because people got all upset and tried to figure out how to stop it, including the Kuwaiti. And what happened was, I know you're familiar with this, we all are, and virtually everyone gets this wrong, the myth that Saddam Hussein tried to murder George HW Bush with a truck, Bahama assassination attempt in Kuwait in 1993, total hoax debunked by Seymour Hirsch by the end of the year in a article for the New Yorker called Case Not Closed.\n\nHe shows it was just a whiskey smuggling ring that they embellished into this plot against Bush. And then it was Martin Inic, who was Bill Clinton's advisor. Who was he? He was an Australian who'd been working for Yak Shair, the Laud party, well, former terrorist murderer. And then laud party Prime Minister of Israel. And Inic had gone from there to go work in, I don't know exactly the time off a year or so. He stopped and went to work for Clinton. In the meantime, he founded the Washington Institute for Near East Policy Win, which was directly a spinoff of apac.\n\nAPAC put up the money, that's the American Israel Public Affairs Committee, the heart of the Israel lobby. They put up the money for the Washington Institute for Near East Policy, which you have heard that name a million times. And you're gonna continue to hear it because they're always cited as middle of the road scientific experts on American foreign policy when they were, and this is not the same about all NeoCon think tanks, but this one was literally created by the Israel lobby in the United States. And then he became an advisor to Bill Clinton. And he was insisting on this policy, essentially continuing the HW Bush policy of staying in Saudi Arabia in order to patrol the so-called no fly zones over Iraq to keep Sadam Hussein from killing the Iraqis and enforced the blockade, which was enforced by world law anyway, right?\n\nLike there's some smuggling going on or whatever, but no nation state is violating the embargo against Iraq here. So it's completely unnecessary on both counts. But the Israelis, and this is Rabin's government. Yin's government is I guess in agreement with this laud guy, Indic on this. They're pushing for a policy that they called dual containment. And the point was that Iraq, now that we beat them up so bad in Iraq, War One Desert Storm, first Gulf War, now they're not powerful enough to balance against Iran. So now America has to stay in Saudi Arabia to balance against them both. And Bill Clinton resisted this and resisted this until the big fake assassination attempt against Bush Sr.\n\nWhich again, I don't have any reason to believe the Israelis were behind. That was the Kuwaiti's who rigged up, oh, did I leave out that it was the girl who pretended that she saw the babies thrown outta their incubators, right? It was her father was the one who spun up this story. So in other words, the same guy who spun up that story, it was the same guy who spun up this story about the assassination attempt against Bush Senior, which everybody still believes. And which I'm sure Bush Jr. Believed at the time that he launched that war, probably was he Reed Seymour Hirsch? He doesn't know. And and it was just conventional wisdom. And I was still just a teenager in the 1990s, but I don't remember, wow, that assassination against Bush thing was debunked. I don't remember that ever getting around. You know what I mean? I don't know who was reading Hirsch at that time. It was pre-internet times by a year, right?\n\nIt just wasn't, it just wasn't a hot enough topic, you know what I mean? How\n\nDo you fight those false narratives that the Military Industrial Complex tries to produce in order to get us into war?\n\nWell the main thing is speak up. I think the most, I, yeah, the most important thing is read anti-war dot com every day for a long period of time in a row and you will have a very good handle on what the hell is going on in the world. It was founded by Eric Garrison, Justin Raimondo, who are both a couple of, libertarians Raimondo was a student of Murray Rothbard's, or at least one of his mentees, you know, learned a lot from heir of his foreign policy thought Murray Murray and Roth Barr the best libertarian. And so that's where we come from is that tradition. And you know, Ron Paul and non-interventionist types and, but the news is, and and, but our opinion pieces come from all of the spectrum.

      "transcript_chunk": "Do you find it strange at all that so many people still love candles? I mean, ever since we got electricity, candles have been non-essential. Let's call them right, an obsolete technology, but they have not disappeared. Every generation seems to rediscover them. Why do you think that is?\n\nYeah, it's a very interesting question. It's interesting to think about how the job that candles do has changed over time. You could go back 5,000 years to the first things that were like candles, and I would describe it as portable fire. It's portable fire that lets you find your way or lets you do work when it's dark.\n\nThis might be a little clay lamp with oil in it and a wick or something.\n\nThe earliest records that we know about would be in ancient Egypt. A pithy reed just dipped in some animal fat.\n\nI\n\nSee. But we see wicked candles maybe 3000 years ago. A lot of records that the Romans were using them. It's WIC and wax and it's essentially what we still have today, especially in the last 50 years. The job is no longer utilitarian. It might be decor or even if it is about light, it's about setting a mood and then the other jobs of home fragrancing or self-care indulgence. I think all those things together with that primal light experience is just something that really speaks to a lot of people. I personally feel sort of drawn to the light like I'm a primitive bug.\n\nThat was Stevec. He's president of the National Candle Association. The candle industry does about $10 billion a year in global sales, and that number has been rising fast. A lot of this increase is driven by scented candles, but there are also tapers pillars, tea lights, votives, and more. I don't know about you, but to me this candle boom is somewhat surprising and slightly weird. The vast majority of the world has access to electricity and one of the many advantages of electricity is that it eliminates the need for a live flame in your house, a flame that can burn down your house, and yet for some reason, we still want that portable fire in our homes.\n\nWhy? One theory involves a word that is spelled H-Y-G-G-E.\n\nIt's pronounced Hoge.\n\nThat's Mike Viking. He's a Danish happiness researcher. You probably know that Denmark is on average a very happy place.\n\nI think the best explanation of what Hoge is is the art of creating a nice atmosphere. It's about togetherness, it's about pleasure, it's about warmth, it's about relaxation, and that is a key cornerstone of Danish culture. Danes HOA is what freedom perhaps is to the Americans,\n\nBut Americans these days also seem to want their cougar. Around half of those 10 billion global candle dollars are spent in the us. So today on Freakonomics Radio, Why Do Candles Still Exist? What other nostalgic technologies do we clinging to? What role does planned obsolescence play in all of this, and why do we stuff our closets full of antiquated things.\n\nIt almost is like a process of psychoanalysis.\n\nThis is Freakonomics Radio, the podcast that explores the hidden side of everything with your host Steven Dubner.\n\nWhat is the most unusual candle scent you've ever encountered?\n\nI've seen a lot of things like bacon and beer. Some of those are just, you know, interesting but not appealing to me.\n\nThat again is Steve Hark of the National Candle Association or NCA.\n\nThe NCA was founded in 1974. We act as the collective voice of the candle industry. Whenever that's needed, we promote candle safety. We are an authority on candle manufacturing and science. We support scientific research into candles.\n\nWhen our daughter was younger, my wife and I forbade her from burning candles in her bedroom. 'cause a couple times she almost burned down the house. Isn't it just a little bit strange that we are all allowed and even encouraged to use open flames in our homes?\n\nYeah, so there is a responsibility of the user to use the candle safely. So if I can, I want to tell you the big three and make sure that all the listeners are aware of 'em. Please. First of all, when you burn a candle, always keep it within sight. Number two, keep it away from anything that can catch fire. That especially means betting, but also things like curtains. And number three, keep them away from children and pets. If you do those three things, then the chances of starting a candle fire in your home are greatly reduced,\n\nBut not everyone is so careful. According to the nonprofit National Fire Protection Agency, candles are responsible for about 6,000 home fires a year in the us, resulting in an average of 74 civilian deaths and a quarter of a billion dollars in property damage. By the way, serving as president of the National Candle Association is not Steve EK's only job. In fact, the reason he has that job is because of his other job.\n\nYeah. My main job is that I'm a research fellow at Procter and Gamble. I work in research and development focused mainly on our aircare business. So brands like Fabric.\n\nSteve, what does it mean to be a research fellow at p and g?\n\nThe full title is Senior Director Research Fellow. What it means is that I am in charge of research programs to improve our products and develop new products unlike an academic where the end goal is just the pursuit of knowledge, our end goal is to make money to make superior products and create superior experiences for people.\n\nEnsc has degrees from Michigan Tech and Georgia Tech in chemical engineering and in pulp and paper science respectively. He has worked at Procter and Gamble for more than 20 years. P and g is one of the biggest consumer goods companies in the world. They make tide laundry detergent, Pampers diapers, Gillette razors, and many other brands. You know, their headquarters are in Cincinnati where the company was founded in the 1830s as a maker of soap and candles. James Gamble was an Irish born soap maker. William Proctor was an English born candle maker. This was a good time to be a candle maker.\n\nYou see the development of automated candle production and molded candles and things like that in 1830 or so, and then you have the discovery of paraffin wax, about 1850 paraffin wax is the solid component of crude oil, and then in 1880 or so, the electric light bulb comes right, and there was a little bit of a decline. Once we get into the 20th century, the materials that make candles became a lot more widely available as they were byproducts of that increased demand for oil and stare in from increased meat packing activity and candles became a little bit more popular again, but they're sold more for ceremonies, for traditions like birthdays, novelty candles for holidays.\n\nThe market stayed pretty steady until the late seventies and early 1980s. That's when you started seeing the shift in the job of candles to more home decor and ambiance in the introduction of scented candles that necessitated some innovation as there really wasn't enough paraffin wax to make up that demand. So you see the invention of vegetable waxes from soy and from palm.\n\nWhen I think about the boom incented candles, I'm wondering if you were involved in the controversy over Yankee candles during COVID. Could you walk us through that?\n\nI am sorry. I really don't know very much about that.\n\nAre you aware of it though? People were writing reviews on Amazon and other places saying that their candles that they were buying from the Yankee candle company were defective because they were unscented when they were supposed to be scented. But what it turns out was a lot of people who had gotten COVID had lost their sense of smell.\n\nNow that you say it, I think I do remember something about that. One of the things that I study and am curious about is just the sense of olfaction in general. It's really one of the least understood senses from a biological standpoint. Like all the mechanisms that are involved in actually smelling, it's in my opinion, been a little bit overlooked in the medical community, but it is a big, big hit on your quality of life.\n\nI have a slightly different take on that because two members of my immediate family have not had a sense of smell. One was born without, which is apparently not, you know, wildly rare and one lost it later. Wow. I mean, yes, my first reaction was like yours, like it's a great loss. On the other hand, you know, we live in New York City and there are a lot of days when I kind of wish I couldn't smell, but that got me to wondering on the flip side, because I know that you as a scientist have done a lot of research on odors. Can you talk about how the world smells on average today compared to the past? I would assume we are in a relatively wonderful smelling era.\n\nWe certainly have a lot of products to keep things smelling better, but overall in terms of how the world smells, I think it actually smells worse. You do, it really has to do with just a lot of crowding. You think about a lot of small apartments and your neighbors cooking and you're in there with your pet in a small space. But yeah, certainly candles and a lot of other air care products are there to help us with that problem.\n\nI'm going to interrupt here to say that while I like and trust Steve Rezac, I'm not sure. I believe that the world smells worse today than it used to. Of course, it depends where you were and when, but think about how many seriously stinky things. There used to be raw sewage dumped into rivers, horse manure piled up on city streets, factories and refineries, spitting smoke and ash into the air. Then there's body odor, bad breath, I could go on, but you get the idea. So I would think that the present on average smells better than the past, but I do appreciate Renzi X's point about our olfactory system being underappreciated and important.\n\nJust as a bad smell can ruin your day, a good one can elevate it. Which gets us back to the candle craze. Yankee candle, one of the biggest candle makers in the US has more than 600 fragrances. Their candles typically sell for 30 to $40, which puts them in the mid price range. You can spend much more than that at Diptic or Joe Malone. Trader Joe's meanwhile sells candles for about $4. Some of their recent fragrances are grapefruit and peach black tea.\n\nOur industry is pretty accessible in that almost anyone can start a candle company without a lot of barriers to entry, a lot of big capital needs. As a result, our industry is pretty vibrant and pretty inclusive. Lots of companies are selling candles. We think that there are about 10,000 different fragrances that you can get in a candle. Can\n\nYou just gimme a few of your favorites over the years or maybe most memorable?\n\nFor me personally, it really depends on what I'm doing. If it's the holidays, then maybe I want to get into a holiday mood. Sometimes it can be pine like trying to say like, you know, I'm out cutting down a Christmas tree. Or you know, maybe it's more of a baking vanilla kind of scent.\n\nHow do you feel about cranberry?\n\nOh, I personally don't really like cranberry scents. How\n\nDo you feel about eucalyptus?\n\nI do like eucalyptus. That is a scent that actually has some cooling properties, sort of like menthol and it gives you that fresh air feel.\n\nSome candle makers enlist social media influencers to promote their products. Here is Sir Candleman who between Instagram and TikTok has more than 400,000 followers.\n\nNest has some gorgeous new candles, but are they good? They sent me one, so let's try it and rate it. It's Sahar, OOD and num. Ooh. So you know what I say. A good candle has three things, scent, style and strength. That smells good y'all.\n\nThat good smelling candle from Nest New York costs $195 plus shipping. If you go to a friend's housewarming party and give them a candle like that, you are making a statement. Here's Steve Herk again.\n\nThey come at all price points. You can find scented candles in the five to $10 range all the way up to a hundred dollars or more.\n\nI have seen those a hundred dollars and more candles and I'm just curious how that market came about. I think a lot of consumers are pretty savvy about how much it costs to manufacture something versus how much it sells for, but I think many consumers are also savvy about, well, once something becomes a kind of object that is beautiful. I understand that that drives prices up. Was that high end of the candle market created by a particular entrepreneur or company? Did it come about more grassroots in that? Tell me what you can.\n\nI would say it mirrors some other industries where you're seeing consumers want more exclusivity, more unique things, and that's part of what drives prices higher. If you think about a candle on the lower end of the market, you're probably talking about something which is more mass produced using modern manufacturing methods with automation maybe uses more common fragrance ingredients. Whereas on the upper end you're talking about more custom made, custom fragrances, fragrances that maybe are in touch with the latest fragrance trends today maybe that are associated with luxury brands or celebrity spokespeople and those kind of things.\n\nThere is one inescapable and slightly uncomfortable fact about a candle. The more you use it, the faster you lose it.\n\nTo understand product lifetimes, you have to understand the reasons why people buy products.\n\nThat is Tim Cooper from Nottingham Trent University in the north of England. He is an emeritus professor of sustainable design and consumption. With a background in economics, Cooper has found that more and more people, producers, and consumers are thinking about the lifespan of products.\n\nA lot of the interest has come from the electronic sector, not least because that's an area where products have been criticized by many consumers for not lasting long enough, but also an area where there's a natural tendency for products to change over time as technology advance is. There's also been interest from the clothing sector because clothing technically is what they call a semi durable product. They can last for a long period of time, but obviously in the fashion sector, clothing doesn't last very long. There's also been interest in other areas as well. Car industry, for example, furniture\n\nAnd how does Tim Cooper think about the candle industry?\n\nWe rarely need a candle for light, but there's a large industry in the use of candles for decorative purposes. And this raises interesting questions. To what extent are products merely functional or in the case of candles functioning as they used to in the past? Or are there other reasons why people buy products? In the case of candles, they don't need them for life. They need them for emotional satisfaction. That explains why we buy so much stuff. It's not just because we have to have it or we won't survive. It's because we want to have it, 'cause it's doing different things for us.\n\nWhat are those different things for that, I think we may need an anthropologist.\n\nWhenever the weather gets cold, I feel like I have to buy more candles.\n\nIt's coming up after the break.

      "transcript_chunk": "Have you ever found yourself agitated or confounded or just sick of the current state of affairs and wondered What It might be like to live in another time?\n\nI do not belong to this time period. I know it sounds crazy, but when I wore armor and I'm sitting in front of a castle in Germany or in Poland, I felt like I belonged there. You know, I I I feel at home\n\nFor some people. Home is in the Middle Ages.\n\nIt appears to be a simpler time. People worked hard and played hard. It seems exotic to us. Now\n\nThe exotic place these people are in is New Jersey at the Burlington County Fairgrounds. It's a warm sticky Sunday in June and they are attending the annual New Jersey Renaissance Fair, fair with an E at the end. Despite the heat, they're wearing woolen vests and long sleeved dresses, heavy boots also among the men, a lot of very bushy beards. Matt Schwarz is one of the musical performers. He is a harpist.\n\nI think nowadays you look at a world that doesn't have a lot of our modern problems and you think it was perfect. Of course back then they had their own problems. But I think there's much to be said with a world in which you're in touch with, with the outdoors in nature.\n\nJordan Cavalier is another musical performer.\n\nThis is called the Nickel Harpa. It's a Swedish key fiddle. It's 16 strings of medial Swedish glory. It has three melody strings, one drone string, and 12 sympathetic strings. I started playing six years ago and now I'm here refa playing it. This is like my life. Now,\n\nIn the US alone there are a couple hundred Renaissance fairs. Each year they give you a chance to hear period music, eat a Turkey leg or a giant pickle and pretend that you are not only in a different time, but that you are a different person.\n\nI am so Magan the Night of Fortitude, part of the night of Virtue, soon to fight in the Tournament of Virtue here at one 30 on the field.\n\nOkay, so there's two nights on like different horses on opposing sides and they're, they have like their jousting stick and they're trying to get the rings, so whichever one gets the rings, they get the point.\n\nAnother night Paul Mahaffey emerges from his jousting tournament, sweaty and winded.\n\nIt's almost been a year since I armored up and I love it. There's, it was exhausting, but I could do it again. In 10 minutes, the adrenaline gets going and you just get in there. It's just you and him. That's all you see. 'cause you can't see anything else in the helmet and it's great.\n\nOkay, so that's what they're all doing here. What are we doing here? When we set out to make a three part series about the arc of human life, we knew we would begin with birth and child rearing. That was last week's episode. You can catch up later if you missed it. We also knew that the final episode would be about aging and death, but what about the middle episode? We thought it would be interesting to explore what it's like to be middle Aged, but then you realize that our current concept of middle Aged is very new. At the beginning of the 20th century, average life expectancy was only 31 years old. Now that number on its own is misleading. There were plenty of old people and middle Aged people too, but the average was brought down by the incredibly high rate of child mortality.\n\nSo we got to wondering what was it like to be middle Aged back in the Middle Ages? And we asked the Renaissance fair attendees a simple question. If you could go back, would you go back?\n\nI'd rather be middle Aged in pretty much any century in the Middle Ages. That was rough, rough time.\n\nI would've not survived anything. No, I need like a Marriott, but I need like a JW Marriott. I don't even survive this when it rains.\n\nSo we have this thing today called ibuprofen that is a very, very powerful help to being middle Aged.\n\nSo that's how the Fairgoers feel today on Freakonomics Radio, we get an expert view on What It was like to be middle Aged in the Middle Ages. Ibuprofen not\n\nIncluded.\n\nThis is Freakonomics Radio, the podcast that explores the hidden side of everything with your host Steven Dubner.\n\nThe Middle Ages as agreed upon by most historians, cover the years from roughly 500 to 1500. Most historians also agree that renaissance fairs are not entirely accurate, so we decided to speak with a couple of actual historians.\n\nMy name is Nele Hja and I teach medieval history at Columbia University.\n\nHow would you describe generally your research interests?\n\nMy research interests are mostly in religious history of the Middle Ages, specifically history of Christianity. But because religion is so pervasive in the medieval world, basically every other type of history falls into the religious history that is social history, political history and everything. So I basically study everything.\n\nHow did you come to this particular concentration?\n\nMy story is a little bit unusual really, because I actually graduated from college as an industrial engineer. Oh,\n\nSorry. Yeah, that's a change.\n\nThat is a change. But then in the last year of engineering, I had read Umberto Echo's name of the Rose, and there I met for the first time the Franciscan order. What is special about Franciscan order is that they really wanted to be poor, very, very poor, poorer than everybody else. And I thought, who on earth might like to be poor? That seemed to me so strange, such a great contrast to modern life when everybody wants to be rich. I was very fascinated from the beginning with the monks and friars life now. I see a lot of problems in that kind of life that I didn't see before.\n\nFor instance,\n\nFor instance, no matter how hard they try, their passions and moral issues do not leave them. We think that the monks are calm and peaceful, dedicating their lives to God. But when you read the sources, it's not like that. They are very much acting. They\n\nCould be angry and horny.\n\nExactly. And corrupt and greedy.\n\nOkay, so that's Nestle shek, our first scholar of the Middle Ages. Let's meet the other one.\n\nMy name's Philip Schofield. I am a medieval historian at Abes with,\n\nThat's a university in Wales.\n\nMy main interests are in the broad air of economic history and I work particularly on peasantry.\n\nWhat would you say drew you to the study of peasantry?\n\nAs an undergraduate, I was really intrigued by the broad socioeconomic history that medievals, especially in France were doing, looking at the social structure of medieval villages.\n\nWhen I read about the work of archeologists and others who find physical evidence or ruins, it always seems a bit miraculous that things have survived from so long ago and yet it does happen. When you study economic history, I'm curious what the evidence is like and if it feels as though you're always reaching through a veil of sorts. Never quite getting to the reality.\n\nThat's always the sense. On one level, when I was doing my doctorate, I wrote at one stage something like, he probably thought that, and my supervisor, someone called Barbara Harvey, she said, what are you doing? You don't probably think it. You either know it or you don't know it, and if you don't know it, leave it out. That's sort of old school, but I it, it appeals to me really. I imagine if I walked through a 14th century peasant village on the basis of my understanding from 14th century records, there's undoubtedly a lot of things that would surprise me. But there are local court records, manorial records that are really the records generated by Lords, but include a huge amount of incidental information directed at the peasantry, including, for example, litigation.\n\nThat's something I work on quite a bit, is actually peasants not litigating with their lords, but peasants litigating with each other.\n\nI asked Philip Schofield if he was willing to imagine the daily life of a middle Aged peasant from that era, maybe a composite figure based on bits and pieces of schofield's research. He was actually able to do us one better than that.\n\nI did write something almost 30 years ago now in a journal called Past and Present about two peasants who litigated. So they're both real people and because they were extremely enthusiastic litigants, they tended to be more evident. And because they were relatively wealthy, they were also more evident and they also exist in taxation data. So that's the kind of person I would maybe go to.\n\nExcellent. Of these two peasant litigants, I need you to pick one that you can describe for us. Who would you prefer?\n\nI will pick someone called Robert, the son of Adam.\n\nOkay. Robert, the son of Adam. Where does he live?\n\nHe lived in a place called Hindu Clay in Suffolk.\n\nAnd what year would you like to place Robert, the son of Adam in Hindu clay. That would count as his middle age,\n\nLet's say about 1305. I hope he's not dead by then. He was certainly active around that time and was doing pretty well.\n\nHow old is he?\n\nI would say he was probably in his thirties.\n\nAnd that counts as middle Aged then?\n\nI think so, yeah. I was thinking about this today and what I know about calculations of life expectancy, most of that is really hard to do from the records I've describing, but it's really monastic evidence from the 15th century where you've got a whole range of moments in amongst life in places like Westminster Abbey and Durham, cathedral, priory and so on. And then you can follow them through various administrative tasks and then often they end up in the infirmary and their desks are recorded. The estimates for that tend to suggest that life expectancy is taking people into the late forties. 50.\n\nOkay. We will return later to Robert, son of Adam, a relatively wealthy peasant in hinder Clay, England. I asked Nestle Shaza who grew up in Turkey, what it's like to really immerse yourself in medieval history.\n\nIt gives you perspective, it gives you an alternative. It takes you out of the bubble, which is modern life. When we grow up, we are born into this life. We sometimes think that this is the only way things could be, but it could have been another way.\n\nSo if I asked you to switch places with someone from that period, would you be would willing or interested?\n\nIf I'm going to have my kids with me, yes. If certain conditions are met, I guess I would, yeah. 'cause it's a much simpler life. I'd like to be an artisan in a city, I guess. Mm.\n\nWhat would you make?\n\nStained glass would be nice. I mean, stained glass is so beautiful. People in the Middle Ages had their shops actually inside their homes, so I don't have to even go somewhere else.\n\nWhere exactly would you choose to live?\n\nLet's make it Italy.\n\nIn a city or rural?\n\nIt has to be a city, really. Italian cities were much more advanced in the 13th century. Much better organized. You have free healthcare, free education. If I'm rural than I would have to be peasant.\n\nAnd you want to be an artisan? Yes,\n\nI'd rather be an artisan. I think being a peasant requires far too much energy, which I don't think I have.\n\nLet's start with the city. Where will you live?\n\nWell, I quite like Florence, so it would have to be Florence.\n\nWhat year shall we pick? 12?\n\nFifties would be good\n\nIn real life today. Do you have a spouse or partner?\n\nI do have a spouse, yes. And he's Italian actually.\n\nSo Nestle shek has raised the stakes by including herself in our exercise and she's bringing along her husband and two sons. I asked Philip Scofield what we know about the family of Robert, the son of Adam.\n\nHe's got a brother. Beyond that, it's difficult to be entirely sure. We do know from other contemporaries that if he was fairly typical, he would have a wife and maybe a small number of surviving children, some of whom would survive into adulthood. So it's quite reasonable to suppose that he had three or four children who moved beyond infancy.\n\nWhat do his children do? At what age do they start to perhaps work with him? Well,\n\nThey were still really young, you know, less than 10. So small scale herding, managing crops, keeping birds off things, helping with harvest and so on.\n\nWhat level of education would these kids be getting?\n\nEducation is fairly limited. A lot of education is the education of the village in a sense of learning from doing in some ways. What\n\nDoes Robert eat and drink?\n\nThe bulk of his diet would've been predominantly grain-based, but leavened by fish, both sea fish and fresh water. Fish, maybe a little bit of meat, probably bacon, but also poultry. Quite a lot of ale in his diet.\n\nIs there a relatively low alcohol version of ale that children and others would drink since it was safer than water? I mean\n\nChildren are drinking ale, definitely. Whether it's low alcohol or not, it's difficult to be entirely sure.\n\nObviously in Florence you would have access to very good wine. What\n\nWould a family dinner look like?\n\nIt would definitely have vegetables and fruit. Meat is a little bit more problematic for medieval people 'cause it's expensive. Pork and chicken would be cheaper than beef, so we might have that maybe once a week. People did consume a lot of beans and lentils and things like that. Also because they were durable, they don't go bad. We wouldn't obviously have any fridge or anything, not even a cellar. But also, of course the main staple of any diet is the bread.\n\nSay a bit more about why you are determined to put yourself in a city and not a village or the countryside.\n\nThe big difference is that you are much less exposed to the elements. City life is pretty safe compared to the rural life because the cities are walled. They're very well protected in the countryside. You do get raid, you might have animals coming in, wild animals, which were much more in number in the Middle Ages than they are now. Obviously they've been hunted down over the years. There is food insecurity in the countryside. I wouldn't have food insecurity because generally what the medieval cities like Florence did, they had big granaries. They stored grain just in case there's famine and then they would distribute it to the citizens.\n\nLet's talk about the state of commerce. How does that work? How much do you make and what are you able to buy with it?\n\nI would have to find commissioned jobs. If I'm a stain glass maker, that would mean either a church or a monastery would have to gimme orders. There are lots of churches, many more than now. And if a church can afford having stained glass, which would be expensive, I think I can make decent amount of money to be what corresponds today to middle class.\n\nOkay, so you're a middle class, middle Aged artisan in the Middle Ages. Yes.\n\nThat's a lot of middle.\n\nThat's okay. That's why we're here. What is it like to be a freelance artisan then?\n\nWell, the thing is I would have to enter the guilt of stained glass makers. All the trades were very well organized. Today's trade unions, they really have their origins in the Middle Ages, so I would have to pay dues to my gu. I would have to be registered as a master of state class, and the amount of money I can charge would be regulated by them.\n\nWhen you read economic history, the economists are usually anti guild because they see guilds as monopolistic within their domain. There was actually this famous economic essay about how the Candlemakers guild were trying to have a resolution passed that forbade the sun from shining at certain times because with too much sunlight there was less demand for their products plainly. That was not quite real, but the sentiment I think was legitimate. I'm curious, how would you feel about your guild? Would you feel it's generally a positive for you and for the rest of society, positive for you and a negative for the others, and maybe even negative for you because you have to join this guild and pay dues and have your wages probably set as opposed to being a true freelancer?\n\nWell, I'm not inflicted with the aire ideas of the modern economy, which I consider a good thing. The guild is a very good thing for the people inside it.",

We thought it would be interesting to explore what it's like to be middle aged, but then you realize that our current concept of middle aged is very new.

But then in the last year of engineering, I had read Umberto Echo's name of the Rose, and there I met for the first time the Franciscan order. What is special about Franciscan order is that they really wanted to be poor, very, very poor, poorer than everybody else. And I thought, who on earth might like to be poor? That seemed to me so strange, such a great contrast to modern life when everybody wants to be rich. I was very fascinated from the beginning with the monks and friars life now.

      "transcript_chunk": "y. I don't know. Maybe not.\n\nAnyway, we're going into history. We're learning a lot. The perspectives differ strongly. Can we look into the, maybe a ridiculous question, but a nuclear proliferation, you already started to speak to both of you. If you look like 10, 20 years out now, does, does the US attacking Iran, does that send a message even to MBS, to other Middle Eastern nations that they need to start thinking about a Nuclear weapons program specifically? Like do you think just in a numbers way, does the number of nukes in the world go up in 10, 20, 30 years?\n\nSo look, I I think it's a great question. Will there be more Nuclear Weapons powers in the future or less as a result of this decision by President Trump? So I actually think there'll be less, and I'll tell you as succinctly as I can, and that is that it's been very clear from the Saudis, from the Turks, certainly from the, even the Algerians and others, that if Iran gets a Nuclear weapons, they too want a Nuclear weapons. In fact, the Saudis have gone even further and said, if, if Iran is allowed to retain the key enrichment capability that they have under J-C-P-O-A, that we want that too. If there's an Iran standard, we want the Iran standard.\n\nWe don't want the, the gold standard. In fact, that's been the subject of intensive negotiations between the United States and Saudi Arabia for the past couple of years, both under Biden and Trump as part of the US Saudi agreement defense agreement. An economic agreement that that has been underway. It is very, it's very clear that there's gonna be a proliferation cascade in the Middle East if the Iranians get a Nuclear weapons and certainly if they're allowed to retain this enrichment capability. I also worry about, we haven't even talked about it at all, this conversation. I mean, the most important area in the world, the United States is not the Middle East. It's China and the Indo-Pacific. And I worry that the South Koreans, the Taiwanese and the Japanese will say, you know what?\n\nWe don't trust in any US commitments to stop Nuclear Weapons. You failed on Iran. We don't trust you. We don't trust your nuclear umbrella. We too want Nuclear Weapons in order to guard our security against China. And so what you would see, I, I hope it doesn't happen, but I worry about is this kind of proliferation cascade in the Middle East and in the Indo-Pacific, two of the most important areas for American national security, which is why I think it's very important that that be, that Irans be stopped. Now, whether this attack is succeeds in stopping Iran's Nuclear weapons or accelerates it, we, we disagree, but I think neither us know yet hard to predict.\n\nBut what I think is absolutely certain is that if Iran develops that Nuclear weapons and is allowed to retain the key capabilities to do so, you're gonna see five, six countries in the Middle East, at least three, four countries in the Indo-Pacific asking for the same capability. And then you're gonna have a club of Nuclear Weapons powers that will have an additional 5, 6, 7 over the next 10 to 20 years.\n\nWhat if they don't, what if they're prevented? Doesn't that still send the same message to everybody that they should build?\n\nOh, I think it sends the opposite message, LEX. I think if they see what has happened and that it's, and that it's successful and it stopped Iran from developing Nuclear Weapons. And in addition, Trump is able to negotiate an agreement for zero enrichment and full dismantlement, then the message to all these other countries is, number one, you don't need it. And number two, if you try to get it, then the United States is going to use American power. Now, I'm not suggesting the United States is gonna start bombing the Saudis or the Turks or the Emiratis. Clearly not the Japanese. I mean these are, many of them are our allies. But I think the United States retains many tools, counterproliferation tools to prevent these countries from developing Nuclear Weapons, including, you know, sanctions and export controls and many of the things.\n\nAnd plus I think those countries, you know, un understand that in the Middle East, despite Scott's focus on Israel, you know, when you talk to Arab leaders, their biggest concern is the threat from Iran. It's not the threat from Israel. They're not concerned with the threat from Israel. That's why he had the Abraham Accords. You know, this is why the UAE and Bahrain and Morocco entered into this peace agreement with Israel. The Saudis will one day, and they'll bring many other Arab and Muslim countries in it. They don't say Israel is a threat. They see Iran as a threat. And so if you counter that threat, you eliminate Iran's Nuclear Weapons, proliferation and expansion, those countries now no longer have to build Nuclear Weapons capabilities to counter the Iranians.\n\nNow, we've also restored our credibility. We don't bluff, we said Iran doesn't develop Nuclear Weapons. They won't. And now it's the Japanese who have, as Scott rightly pointed out, they do have reprocessing and plutonium capabilities. The Taiwanese who used to have a military Nuclear Weapons program and gave it up, and the South Koreans who agreed to our gold standard of zero enrichment, zero reprocessing, those three countries can now say, okay, we rely on the United States on your word, on your power, and on your ability to, to actually turn words into action. We don't need Nuclear Weapons. So I, I'd say if successful big, if big, if, if successful, then it's going to be a significant guard against the potential of greater nuclear proliferation.\n\nAnd we will have less nuclear powers, Nuclear Weapons powers than than we otherwise\n\nWould've. My favorite thing is when you guys point out, when you agree with the other person. Anyway, Scott, what do you think? What, what do you think everything that's just happened over the past two weeks does to nuclear nuclear proliferation over the next 5, 10, 20 years?\n\nOh, I mean, I really don't know for sure, but I would think that the, there's a very great danger that it's going to reinforce the lessons of North Korea, Iraq, and Libya, which is, you better get a nuke to keep America out and you better hurry before it's too late. Now for the Saudis, they're not gonna do that 'cause they're obviously a very close American client state. So it's a different dynamic there. But you know, for any country that has trouble with the United States or is worried about the future of their ability to maintain their national sovereignty, obviously getting their hands on an ABO as quickly as possible is, has been, you know, re incentivized to a great degree. Also really worried about the future of the Nonproliferation Treaty with a Nuclear weapons states promised to respect the right of non-nuclear weapons states to civilian nuclear energy.\n\nAnd where here you have a non NPT signatory Nuclear Weapons state, Israel launched an aggressive war against an NPT signatory that is, was not attacking them and was not making Nuclear Weapons. And with the assistance of the World Empire, the United States, another Nuclear weapons state signatory to the NPT, and I don't really take this that seriously, but it's worth at least listening to, is Veev the once and probably future president of Russia. He said, oh yeah, well maybe we'll just give him a nuke or kind of implied, maybe get Pakistan to Now for people familiar with like Key and Peele Veev is sort of angry Obama, right?\n\nFor Putin, you know, that skit where it's like Obama talks all calm anger\n\nTranslator\n\nPeele goes off like a angry black guy kind of character. Right?\n\nHe's been going nuts on Twitter.\n\nYeah, Veev, he, he goes way out, you know, above and beyond. But I think he's probably acting on instructions to talk that way. And it is a real risk that the MPT could just fall apart when it becomes, when it's treated so callously by the United States who invented it and insisted that the rest of the world adopt the thing to such a great degree.\n\nTrump did say, don't use the N word. He, he talked down to Vedo. That's right. Yeah, he did. Don't go around the n the nuclear word.\n\nYeah. Well, and and I appreciate that. It's good. And\n\nI, he's right, he's writing that. It, it's not, it's just serious.\n\nAnd look, if Pakistanis could give a nuke to Iran, who are their friends, I think not the tightest of allies. I'm not saying I predict that, but there's a danger to that. Now, when it comes to, you know, Eastern Asia, obviously there's a concern about a Chinese threat to Taiwan, then nobody thinks China's coming for South Korea or Japan. The the question of Taiwan is one that's very different because as the American president agreed with Mao, say tongue 50 years ago, Taiwan is part of China and eventually will be reunited, although we hope that's not by force. Since then, they have essentially abandoned Marxism, although it's still a one party authoritarian state, but they've essentially abandoned Mark Marxism adopted markets, at least to the degree that they've been able to afford, to now build up a, a giant naval force that is capable of retaking Taiwan.\n\nAnd so I think the way to prevent that is not from making a bunch of threats and setting examples and other places about how tough we are, but to negotiate with the Chinese and the Taiwanese and figure out a way to reunite the two in a peaceful way in order to prevent that war from breaking out. Because in fact, we don't really have the naval and air capability to defend Taiwan. We could lose a lot of guys trying and probably kill a lot of Chinese trying, but in the end, they'd probably take Taiwan anyway. And we'd have lost a bunch of ships and, and planes for nothing. So we can negotiate an end to that. And then even if America just withdrew from the region, we could still negotiate long-term agreements between China, Japan, South Korea, and whoever.\n\nThere's no reason to think that everyone would make a, a mad scramble to a bomb to protect them the moment they are out from under America's nuclear umbrella and so forth. And the fact of the matter is that, you know, the greatest threat to the status quo as far as the nuclear powers go, probably is what just happened. America and Israel launching this war against a non-nuclear weapon state as a member in good standing of this treaty throws the, the whole, as they call it, the liberal rules based world order into question. I mean, if these rules repeatedly always apply to everyone else, but very often not to us, then are they really the law or this is just the will of men in Washington DC and how long do we expect the rest of the world to go ahead and abide by that if you know a deal is a deal until we decide, as Bill Clinton said, to wake up one morning and decide that we don't like it anymore and, and change it.\n\nThat was a phrase from the founding act of 97. Ah, maybe we'll wake up one morning and decide that we don't wanna do something else entirely. Now, is\n\nThat your Bill\n\nClinton impression? No, I'll spare you. Okay.\n\nThat was pretty good.\n\nAfter the show, when we're not recording. Yeah, I\n\nGot a couple can can I respond to a couple things here just really quickly? I'll try to do it quickly. First of all, you know, the, the notion that Iran is in full compliance with the NPT is, is just not the case. And the International Atomic Energy Agency has made it clear in report after report after report that Iran is in violation of its obligations under the protocols of the IAEA under the request that the IAEA have made and under the NPT. So they're a serial violator of the NPT, unlike all these other countries we've been talking about that our allies. Second is this, this quote, Iran is not attacking Israel. That's quite an amazing quote, which kind of ignores I think 50, 60 years of Iranian attacks against Israel, including suicide bombings and missiles and drones and October 7th.\n\nAnd it, it's indisputable that Iran has been attacking Israel and they've been, they've been doing it for many years through their terror proxies that they fund and finance and and weaponize. And since October 7th, they directly struck Israel with hundreds of ballistic missiles in April and October of last year. So this notion that before 12 days ago, Iranians were just playing nice with the Israelis and the Israelis just came out. I didn't say that out of the flu. Well, you said quote unquote Iran is not, is not attacking Israel. So I mean, it's just not true.\n\nYeah, they were not in a state of war until Israel launched a state of war. That's the fact. Yeah, they were, everyone knows that war. You go, oh, well they backed a group that did a thing. Yeah, okay.\n\nKilled thousands of Israelis maim thousands of Israelis\n\nSuicide. But that attack bomb suicide has not ordered in Tehran. The Wall Street Journal says that US intelligence does not believe that Tehran ordered that attack. They found out about\n\nThe Wall Street Journal says then what the US intelligence says, and we can dispute whether they directed it on October 7th. Everybody knows indisputably that Iran financed Hamas provided f Hamas Israel weapons, well just a second, provided Hamas with weapons that the IRGC and the KDZ force were training Hamas, Hezbollah backed by Iran was training Hamas. There were three meetings before October 7th, one in Beirut, one in Damascus, and one in Tehran where the IRGC, Hezbollah, Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad were together. There was a meeting in Tehran that was attended by Hamnet, the Supreme leader now at those three meetings right before October 7th, you know, maybe they're discussed in the weather, maybe they were discussing Persian poetry, I don't know.\n\nBut it is hard to believe they weren't discussing something and the fact that they had armed Hamas financed Hamas and weaponized Hamas suggests to me that there is pretty overwhelming evidence that Iran has been at war with Israel for decades.\n\nCritics of Israel will say that Benjamin Netanyahu has also been indirectly financing Hamas by allowing the fund, the funds going.\n\nAnd they'll say that America backs Israel. So anything Israel does is America's responsibility too, under that same logic. Right?\n\nI I think you started to make a a point disagreeing with Scott about that they're not a good member of the NNPT. That's\n\nAll tiny technical violations. None of that has anything to do with weaponization. It's always so, yeah, how do you explain this isotope? And they go, well, it must've came with the Pakistani junk that we bought from acon. And then later that's verified. Yeah. And they go, yeah, well we wanna inspect this, let us, and they go, no. And then they do a year later and then they find nothing there. Yeah.\n\nThat's just not the case. That's just entire\n\nHistory of Iran, of the I AEAs objections to Iran. Yeah.\n\nSo your listeners, I know they're not gonna do it 'cause it's a lot of technical\n\nReading to do with weaponization,\n\nBut just go out, go out and read diversion of nuclear material IAEA reports dating back at least 20 years and you'll see the IA meticulously, methodically dispassionately outlining all of the violations that Iran has embarked on of the NPT. Virtually\n\nAll those are resolved later. They won't answer this, and then later they do, they won't answer that. And then later they do.\n\nAnd many open files are still a still there. I mean, just again, like I just, I just want your viewers to walk away from this conversation thing. Okay. That's interesting. I I I didn't know that and that I'm gonna go fact check mark and fact check Scott and just kind of see what this is all about, right? Because otherwise it's just he says, she says, or he says, he says, the fact of the matter is, is that Iran has been in violations of its obligations under the NPT under the additional protocol. It never, it never, it never ratified under its safeguards, obligations under the NPT. It suggests a pattern of nuclear mendacity.",
