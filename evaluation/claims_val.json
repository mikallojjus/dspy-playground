      "transcript_chunk": "where they had to kill it because it was killing all these cows. And they had stumbled upon this one calve that had gotten right before they got to it. It eviscerated this calve and it, it was still alive and it had eaten some of its organs and they had to kill the calve. And then they're like hunting for this mountain lion and he has a video of him shooting this thing. Dogs chase it up a tree and then he shoots it with a bow and arrow. And then he had it stuffed here and he ate it.\n\nDo you aim, you aim for the heart or the head?\n\nYeah. You aim for the heart and the lungs, whatever is available depending on the position of the mountain lion's arm. Right. Like if the arm is like right here, you wanna, you want to tuck it right behind the shoulder and you're gonna get double lungs. And if the arm is up here, you gonna either get the heart or the lungs depending on where their arm is or whether or not you have a, but that's powerful enough to go through the arm and into the body cavity.\n\nIs there a risk, 'cause maybe this is like an urban myth, but if you hurt, hurt an animal, but you don't kill it, it will come back. Some of them will come back to fuck you up like a kind of revenge movie. No,\n\nJohn Wick of animals.\n\nYeah. I imagine they just run away. They\n\nRun away. Well, it's wild like deer that have survived with an arrow in their body cavity. There was a, a deer skeleton that they found of a deer that they, that someone a hunter killed eventually. And this thing had a arrow that had gone through its body and had turned all into bone. So bone had taken over this arrow and the, the whole ca, there it is. That's what it looked like. Wow.\n\nWow.\n\nIsn't that crazy? Mm. So you could see the broadhead had embedded itself in one of the ribs. And so not only did the deer survive, but its body adapted and grew around the arrow.\n\nWow. Wow. Actually, the reason I said that about the nuts. That is insane about the animal was I know that COVID, particularly crows can remember. They can remember. Oh yeah. And then there's been instances where people have hurt crows and the crows phone away. And then a group of them have attacked the person.\n\nOh yeah. They're really smart. They're, they're super and ravens, I think that are, they're actually different than crows. And they're even smarter than crows. Do you know there's a parrot Who was that parrot? That brave parrot? Yeah. Who told us about that? Who was that the other day? Was that Palmer? Palmer Lucky? I think so. I think\n\nSo. Oh, is that the dude with the helmet? Yes. Holy shit. That helmet, bro.\n\nBro, that helmet's nuts. That helmet's nuts. This guy, that guy was, every now and then I get to sit down with someone and they start talking. I go, whoa, he, this guy's fucking crazy smart. Like weirdly smart. Like, oh, okay, I got it. I got it. Like, tell me what you're doing. And he was telling us about this parrot that actually would speak like a human toddler and new colors, new numbers. Could say things could and would communicate\n\nAfrican gray. Yeah, yeah. Yeah. African grays. They have a, they, they can have the IQ of a 4-year-old child. That\n\nIs nuts. Yeah. When you see this thing talking, you're like, yeah.\n\nAnd their imitation of sounds is like\n\nPerfect. Dead\n\nOn. Yeah. Dead on. Yeah.\n\nBut you have to be around them all the time.\n\nRight, right, right. You\n\nHave a twin that you gotta take with you everywhere you go. Yeah.\n\nReally? Because they just get pulled and fuck, fuck. You can fuck shit up.\n\nAnd then they, they're too smart. They actually start like chopping their own wings off and shit like that. Yeah. They get depressed because they don get stimulation depress, they get depressed. They really need a lot of stimulation. Really? Yeah. They're like humans. I thought about owning app para, but I just traveled too much. Yeah. You\n\nDon't know. You don't want that in your life. That's too much work.\n\nIt's, it's a commitment. Yeah. If\n\nYou leave it alone, it would be sad too. Yeah.\n\nBut that's what I'm saying. Yeah. They\n\nGet mad. I had a buddy of mine who had a parrot and when he would leave it, he would come home and start screaming, where the fuck were you? Like, he wasn't really saying that, but it was like, that was what it was saying. Yeah. It was, was screaming.\n\nWhy get married when you've got that? Right.\n\nYeah. And then he had to, upon coming home, immediately take it out and take it out and like put it on his shoulder. Right. Or put it in his hand. And if you put it down for a second it would start getting pissed off. It's crazy. I'm like, dude, he goes, I know it's a lot. He goes, I didn't think it was gonna be this much. It was like, it was a lot of work. Yeah.\n\nJoe, I'm not, hope I'm not being polite. Have you got any of those cigars where all we smoke? I would love a cigar.\n\nLet's go baby.\n\nIt's a weird thing to ask to be. These are really good. I should have said, if you offer us a cigar, we'll accept one. Come on man.\n\nPlease. Thanks, brother. We have a big ass humid door. There is a, oh, I\n\nDidn't bring my light out\n\nOver there. Some here. Right here.\n\nOh, bonobo chimps are very interesting like that as well.\n\nThey're the weirdest, right? Because they just fuck all the time. This might, might need some juice. Let me give you a little juice.\n\nGo\n\nFor it. They're weird because it's like, okay, so chimps can be either hippies or they can be, you know, like the worst barbarians in human history. Well, it's\n\nLike us.\n\nJust like us. Yeah. That's what's weird. 'cause like, but also the bonobos, like they don't have any, they have one rule. The rule is the mom won't fuck the son. That's it. It's\n\nA good rule. So yeah. It's a good fucking rule man. But they're a\n\nBunch of sister fuckers. They're a bunch of sister fuckers and daughter fuckers. Yeah.\n\nBut they're not motherfuckers. They're\n\nProbably dad fuckers too. They're probably fucking, they're probably doing gay sex too. They, they, they seem wild. They're just having a good time. But\n\nThey, so they're homophobic.\n\nNo, not at all. And they solve all their problems with that. Do\n\nYou need to cut these ones? Yeah. How do\n\nYou It opens like a door.\n\nOh, alright.\n\nRight here. And then you pull those.\n\nBut you know they can learn sign language. Oh yeah.\n\nYou know what's interesting though? They don't ask questions.\n\nSo they're like men. Ah.\n\nBut the parrot did.\n\nThe parrot did. Yeah.\n\nThe parrot asked questions. The parrot had some questions about how things work.\n\nThe African grays are incredibly intelligent. Yeah. Incredibly intelligent.\n\nWell, what I'm interested in is what happens when we can start really decoding dolphin language with ai. Right. And once they really understand what they're saying, then things are gonna get very strange.\n\nLight it. And\n\nYou know, because like, what are they, did they, I mean they're really smart, like silly smart. Like dolphins have enormous frontal lobes.\n\nOh yeah. Man. And communication. They\n\nHave dialects. They have,\n\nThey have dialects. Yeah.\n\nThey sound different. Different\n\nParts of the world. That makes sense. I mean that makes sense. Right? The different, slightly different.\n\nWell, on that note, you think, what about whales? Yeah. Whales brains are literally bigger than us. Yeah. They're, they're enormous. So if we're talking about brain size equals I, which I'm\n\nIt's brain size relative to body master. Yeah.\n\nOh is it? Yeah.\n\nYeah. Because you need a big fucking brain to run a big body. Yeah. Right,\n\nRight. Which is also the argument for why the Neanderthals might have been dumber than us.\n\nWell they were from\n\nWhat we think. They don't know that though. Really? Yeah. They had pretty big brains. What's weird about them is they also had language. Yeah. They had writing and or they had, they definitely had tool making. They had\n\nWriting Don't, I don't think they had\n\nWriting. Writing. No, they didn't have writing. They had language. But they, they did do art. That's what it is. Mm. Wasn't writing necessarily, but they drew stuff and they had a brain that's bigger than ours. But they were also like jacked. They had bigger eyeballs. There was a guy that, this was a, there was a crazy theory that I'm sure is horseshit, but it was cool. Like he made Neanderthals look way different. This guy had a theory like, 'cause we're just, we've never seen a live neanderthal. And he was like, what if we are getting it totally wrong? And what if they were more gorilla looking\n\nThan, but we have the skulls and skeletons down\n\nThere. We have some stuff and they also think they have red hair. This guy was, it's a cracked theory. Right, right. But it was a fun theory. But one of the more fun aspects of this guy's crack theory was that their eyeballs are so much bigger than ours. Their sockets are really big. He's like, what if they have night vision like a deer or like a wolf, you know? Which is totally possible for a primate to have. It's not like, it's not like there's anything about being that kind of a mammal that would exclude you from being able to develop night vision eyesight. Are\n\nThere, are there primates that have that?\n\nI don't\n\nKnow because there's mammals for sure. Yeah.\n\nBut what, yeah, let's ask, let's ask perplexity. Perplexity.\n\nIs\n\nThere any, what is that called? When they have night vision when animals are nocturnal and they could see well at night, you know that thing that like when you're driving and you're see\n\nA fox or something? Yeah,\n\nYeah, yeah. The reflective eyes that they all have. Yeah.\n\nYeah. What is that? I don't, what's\n\nThat called? I dunno. I dunno.\n\nWe should know.\n\nDo you know there's a very interesting theory about ne neanderthals and homo sapiens is there are some people who think that we are one of the few species or one of the only species that has a capacity to deceive Oh and trick. So there was, there's a, there's a theory going around that, that\n\nThe monkeys do that monkeys trick other monkeys into thinking there's an eagle coming. So they steal fruit. Do\n\nThey? Yeah. That's interesting.\n\nThey yell out the sound for eagle and then all the monkeys run away and then they steal the fruit.\n\nOh really? Yeah. Wow.\n\nSo here it is. Monkey primates, the tarsier and the night monkey al monkey are the species with the best vision adapted to night conditions. Right. Okay. So they do. Yeah. See, look at that largest eyes relative to body size of any mammal. So it's something about having a large eye. Because if you, okay. So despite lacking a tape, ofum lucidum, the reflective layer that cause eye shine in many nocturnal animals. Oh, that's what that is. The retina is containing extremely high density of rod photoreceptors, which are highly sensitive to dim light. This allows tarsiers to detect and track prey such as insects in near darkness. And they can see in light as low as 0.001 lux. Similar to moonless nights. Damn. So there's a bunch of different little primates. Oh,\n\nLori's.\n\nBut why, I mean, if you were living in a time, especially if you didn't have fire, if you're living in a time where, you know, there's no roofs, like you're, you're, you're hunting, you're outside at night, you're probably spending as much time as you can hunting. 'cause Neanderthals weren't gatherers, they weren't farmers. So all they did was hunt. Mm. So they probably had some sort of night vision, which would've wild.\n\nYeah. The thing that I find interesting is what is there, I think there's certain, the average person in Europe has around 3% Neanderthal,\n\nDNAD,\n\nNAD three, 3% a if you are African zero. Right. So it's, it's just really interesting. And you see some people, and they're more, they kind of have more than neanderthal kind of appearance too.\n\nYeah, for sure.\n\nAnd then other people. And you go, what, what does that actually give you that 3%? What does it do? Is there any discernible difference whatsoever? Does it make you perhaps more athletic, more re more resilient?\n\nIt's a good question. I mean, I think it would depend. I mean there's also a bunch of other weird strains of human that existed that there, you know, like Dennis Ovs and there's, there's quite a few other ones. Yeah,\n\nYeah.\n\nYeah. You know, who knows what if, I think the Dennis Ovs, I think they definitely got into the gene pool too. I forget who they were saying had a high levels of Dennis Ov DNA, it might have been aboriginal Australians. Hmm. But you know, there's, there was a bunch of different types of human, you know, we just figured out how to be the kiest and the most conniving. And I think probably the most clever,\n\nWell, harra, have you read the Sapiens? His thesis is we, we worked out how to work together beyond the 150 done by number. That was his, his idea is basically we created these shared myths. Religion, money, whatever nation, all of the stuff that we all agree is real that, you know, it feels real. Right. But we, the reason we out-competed other species is that we could cooperate across beyond our immediate tribal group. And that's the reason. That\n\nMakes sense. That makes sense. I mean, there's also, human beings have a very distinct desire to make better things all the time. And if you have that and you're applying that to weapons, you're gonna make the best weapons. Right. You know, I don't know if Neanderthals had that. You know, did they have, I mean, if you're gonna make stuff, right? If you're gonna make tools, you must have some creativity and some desire to innovate. And\n\nCuriosity.\n\nYeah. Curiosity, desire to innovate. 'cause we know that, look, there's certain animals that will use weapons. Right. There's certain, like there's a, a famous photograph of an orangutan that's spearfishing. Have you ever seen that? Yeah. Photo. Mm. But it learned how to do it from people and you know, they'll use rocks to break open crabs and they'll do stuff like that. But they're not fastening an arrowhead No. On a stick or a spear. And they're making it with flint. The inter halls did that. So they got to a level where they're like, okay, this is like craftsmanship. Like this is sophisticated craftsmanship. And it would also probably indicate some sort of a complex language that you could explain where you get the, the gut that you turn into fiber that you use to tie the arrowhead to the stick. Like they were, they were doing, they was doing some high level stuff. Yeah.\n\nFor,\n\nSorry,\n\nGo ahead. For a primate.\n\nYeah. I would imagine also a lot of the innovation comes once you have the greater revolution because there's now surplus food. Yeah. And so you can afford to have a bunch of guys sitting around, not hunting, but like thinking about shit or inventing things or you know, making things in a different way. You know?\n\nDid you see that discovery of a skull that was 500,000 years older than they thought was the origin of human beings? So that it potentially pushes back the original homosapiens to 500,000 years? No.\n\nEarlier.\n\nIs that real? Yeah.\n\nYeah. They think it's, it might push back the date. I mean it's an under debate I'm sure. But I think they might push back the date of the rival of homo sapiens to a million years.\n\nWow.\n\nYeah.\n\nBut it just shows, you know, it's nuts. How,\n\nThis is just nuts.\n\nHow little do we know about ancient civilization? Stonehenge in the uk, which is this iconic, you know? Have\n\nYou been\n\nNo, I haven't. No, you\n\nYou should go. It's\n\nReally special energy\n\nThere, man. Yeah. It's really impressive. And like Constance said, there's a special energy and it's, it's a profoundly moving place. When you visit it, you feel as if you have a connection to something else. It's like going to the pyramids. But they have no idea. They have a rough idea of where the stones might have come from, but they've got no idea how they got there. How they erected them. Yeah.\n\nWho you should go man. Joe Rogan arrested a heath airport. That would be a great fucking story. Boy,\n\nI'm sure they can find some tweets\n\nFor us\n\nBrother. Or just the things that I've said.",

When\n\nAre you bailing outta your country? It's sinking that, that is the fucking Titanic. And you are one of the last deckhands.\n\nWe're gonna, we're gonna stand and fight, man. Yeah.\n\nAre\n\nYou really?\n\nYeah. Good\n\nLuck. No, we are. Good\n\nLuck. We're the guys playing\n\nAs long as it's still okay. They're\n\nArrest you for saying stand and fight. It is a excitement of violence.\n\nYeah.\n\nYeah, yeah. No, but it's got, it's interesting. I mean, obviously you had Graham Linehan on the show. We are gonna have him on as well soon to talk about it. But he, his, they're not gonna prosecute him. And not only that, they also said they are not going to investigate noncrime hate incidents anymore. Do you know what those\n\nAre? Oh, interesting.\n\nIt's basically when you've committed no crime, but you're still like hateful.\n\nOh, okay. But that's also very subjective too.\n\nYeah, of course. Of course. So they're not, they're not gonna investigate them anymore. Yeah. But they're still gonna keep track of them is what they said.\n\nOh, keep track. Just, we've got an eye on you. We're gonna make,\n\nWe're gonna make a record of it, but won't investigating. So\n\nAre they gonna stop arresting people for social media posts then?\n\nWhat do you think, Joe? I think,\n\nNo,\n\nI think it's\n\nProfitable.\n\nI think that's,\n\nWell, yeah. It's probably a nice fine. Right? What do you get? You get a fine.\n\nI don't think it's about that. I think, you know, during the, the uber woke era, they put all these laws on the stature book, and the police have to enforce the law. Right. They have no choice. 'cause if a bunch of people complain and then they don't investigate the people that have been reported. Oh,\n\nThat's\n\nWhat it's all about. They get in trouble. Of course. Like if you, the ordinary, like, you know, police officers, right. Police officers don't like enforcing these dumb laws. Of course. It's put on them from above. Yeah.\n\nI just didn't know that all that stuff was put in place in your country during the woke era.\n\nYeah, it was.\n\nAnd the heavy rope, it's almost like a fever dream, you know, when you really go back and pay attention to some of the more insane woke stuff from like, just five years ago. Yeah. Like everyone was losing their fucking mind. It. But like, if I was an elite, if I was one of those lizard people running the world, I'd have been like, well, look here, this is really interesting. Like, this was just a cold, it was just a cold and a little bit of social media input. And we got these people behaving in a way that they'd never behaved before. Admitting to things they'd never admitted to before. Adhering to rules. It never existed before.\n\nYeah. I, I think the thing that I found the most, the, the worst bit about, it wasn't necessarily the behavior of the elites, it was the behavior of ordinary people during that time. Yeah. The fact that your neighbor was so willing to snitch on you because you went for a second walk.\n\nWell, that's why I was interested in it as a lizard person. If I was a lizard person elite, I'd be like, look, these people are dumb. Like, this is really easy to manipulate. Especially, I was just talking to a buddy of mine who's fleeing LA and he was like, I can't anymore. I tried. I just fucking, I hung in there. I can't do it anymore. It's like everybody went crazy. Mm. It's like, it, there's something that happened because of the pandemic and the Black Lives Matter protests and the riots and all the ca It just cha like, whatever the temperature of society was is like, it hit societal global warming where it's like, it's time to investigate Greenland. It's time to move north. Like this is a bad climate now. This sucks. Mm.\n\nAnd LA is a perfect example of this. 'cause we talk about this all the time. You get outta the airport at LAX, you feel that la sun on your skin and you just go, this is paradise. Yeah. It's the, the whole. And then you walk out and you see this, it's paradise. And they fucked it up so bad that people will literally pack up and leave paradise.\n\nWhat Donald Trump should do is when he leaves the office run for governor of California, they just take over California and fix it. It would be hilarious if he did. It would be one of the funniest things of all time. If an 82-year-old man steps into the office of governor of California, we're gonna fix everything. You've got a problem with water. I know how to get the water. It would be fucking hilarious. But\n\nIt's almost like there. So there's a very old joke about Venezuela, where God was creating Venezuela, and he was like, you know what I'm gonna do? I'm gonna make sure they have diamonds, they have gold, they have desert, but they also have jungle. They have beautiful beaches. It's gonna be rich in oil and the whole, and then, well, the entire world goes, Hey, that's unfair. Like, they've gotta have something bad. And God goes, yeah, you know what? You're right. Let's give them the Venezuelans. And that's almost like that with California. You're like, California's too perfect. You know what I mean? It's got everything you need. Right? So what are you gonna do? You've gotta give them something fucked up. And it's just these crazy people who believe in these stupid ideas. But\n\nIt wasn't for a long time. Mm. I mean, you gotta realize Arnold was the governor of California. Mm. Right? And then, you know, Ronald Reagan's from California. He was the governor of California at one time. He too, it wasn't always that nuts. And when you went back to when I went there in the 1990s, it was much more moderate politically. Hmm. Like, you know, people were definitely left leaning, but it wasn't a focus. It wasn't a thing that was discussed all the time. It would just, it wasn't. And I remember working with many, like older actors who were openly conservative. No one cared. It was just like, oh, this is Bob. You know, he's really into Bob Dole. Like, you know, it wasn't, it wasn't unusual. Something happened around the Obama administration. Something happened specifically around his second term that really changed everything. And if you look at like, internet, like searches and use of certain words, especially racism. Yes. It flies. It just hits a\n\nGiant leap. Right? 2014. Yes. 2014. Right around\n\nThen.\n\nYeah. Yeah. And it's not just in America. It's literally everywhere in the world. Yeah. That's why I think it's social media that's caused that.\n\nA hundred percent. It's social media and it's, it's, there's a, there's a bunch of factors. But the problem is now that the genie's outta the bottle, they know how easy we are to manipulate. And I don't think people are learning. They're toing all day long, and they're just like getting blasted with all this negativity and strife and global conflict and Colombian assassinations. That's what I get a, a lot of these assassinations in like cafes. Someone pulls up on a scooter, bang, bang, and they drive off and everybody screams. I've seen a hundred thousand of those I've seen. You know, it's like, everybody's like completely ramped up. And at the same time, you've got people in the UK getting arrested for Facebook posts about immigration.\n\nSo I think part of the problem is, is that people, when they go on these posts, they're not looking for to learn something, as you just said, what they actually want is an emotional reaction. They want to feel something, right. If you live in a society where it's comparatively the easiest it's ever been, and your life is boring. 'cause all you do is get up, you go to work, you go, you have food, you commute, you come back. It's essentially a treadmill where you don't feel any of the ups and downs of emotion. Right. Then what way would you get that? But by going online and seeing something fucking awful happening, you feel terror, you feel sadness, you feel rage. At it's most basic, you feel alive.\n\nWell, it's also just, that's what you're gonna watch. You know? And so you're getting sucked into it just because of the algorithm, which is crazy. We no one ever considered algorithms before. We considered access to information, but we didn't consider that information be curated to hold your attention span. Mm. And all these factors have not been studied. Well, you know, there's been a few guys like Jonathan Haight writing about a few scholars that are really attempting to like, say, Hey, what is a, what's a sociological and what, what are the, what is the long term consequences of this happening? Also for children? These are the first children in the, in human history, growing up on social media, never been done before. We don't know what that's like, like what is it gonna change in terms of empathy, in terms of hostility, acceptance of violence, which is a completely brand new thing on the left. Acceptance and celebration of gun violence never happened before. When I was a kid, it never existed. No one from the left ever celebrated anybody getting assassinated, ever. It just wasn't a thing.\n\nIt's so crazy, man. And you're talking about like language as well? Like we have this, we have the leader of the Green Party in the uk, new guys coming through. He's very popular with people on the left, on, on that side of the left. Anyway. And it's been, what, how long has it been since Charlie Kirk was assassinated? Like a month. Yeah. Right. And he's running around calling like, not, not far. Right. People just like Nigel Farage is a Nazi, is a fascist. And you're just, and you're going, you and I, and we've discussed this so many times with you, man. It's like when you call people these words, like if you and I and Francis thought the Nazis were here to take over, we'd all fight them. Hmm.

And you're doing it in just for political persuasion, power. That's really all. It's, that's what it's, it's like no one really believes Nigel Farage is a fucking Nazi. He's kind of goofy, but he's not a Nazi. Like the what is a Nazi then. And that here's the real problem. This is what nobody wants to admit. If you are in Nazi Germany and you're a 20-year-old man and you're German, and everyone in your town is a Nazi, you are probably a Nazi too. Or you're Jew and you're running Mm Yeah. You're running from these motherfuckers. So either you're a Jew or you're a Nazi, you're either Jewish or you're, you're a fucking evil part of history that everybody refers to as the worst people of all time.\n\nAbsolutely. And you know, we're talking That's\n\nScary.\n\nYeah. That, but it's human nature. Sorry, Francis. It's just we interviewed David Buss yesterday. You've had him on, right? Mm, yes. Evolutionary. I mean, he, he, this is one of the things he talked about is like, within us is the ability we have good adaptations and we have evil adaptations. Yeah. And if you put people in the certain context, and those adaptations are in all of us.\n\nYeah. Donner party. People eat people. Yeah. Yeah. You get get down to, I might die or I might eat somebody. You eat people. Yeah. The guy's already dead. We should just eat them. And then you all sit around and go, oh my God, are we really gonna eat a person? And then you're eating a person, like everybody does. They all have very few people just starve to death when you could just eat a person who's already dead.\n\nAnd it's, you know, Zach Polanski, what he does is, to me, this is the\n\nGreen party guy.\n\nThe green party guy is completely wrong. But then there are people on the far left. So there's a member parliament called Zara. Tana. Yes. That is her real name. Zara Tana. And yeah,\n\nShe sounds like a boss in a video game.\n\nYeah.\n\nWell,\n\nWhat's really interesting is she has, she put a clip on her social media where she goes and she set up this new far left political party. And she says, we've gotta fight Fasci in parliament. We gotta fight them in the ballot box. And you're going, all right, look, I don't like the, the rhetoric. And then she says something even more interesting and we've gotta fight them in the streets. Now you think to yourself, right, if you classify Nigel Farage and the people who vote reform in the uk, which may well win the general election, which may well be the biggest political party and already represents a sizable portion of the uk, you are effectively advocating violence. And it's incitement to violence as far as I'm concerned. But because she's on the far less, she's deemed to be a good person, that's somehow okay. Whereas if Nigel said something like that along those lines, you know, that people would be like, this is a fascist, this is evil, this is disgusting. You shouldn't say that.\n\nYou are also weaponizing mental illness. 'cause one of the things that we know now very clearly, because of all these YouTube videos, all these people that go to these protests and start interviewing folks, some of these people are clearly not well. And this is the thing they've attached themselves to. This is their tribe. This is whether it's no kings or fuck ice or whatever, whatever the tribe is, this is their tribe now. And the, they're schizophrenic or their, you know, fill in the blank, whatever the mental illness is, and you're weaponizing them by calling these people who just differ with you politically or more conservative. You're calling these people the enemy of humanity. Mm. It's very\n\nScary. It is. Right. And you know, I'm one of the people that has gone along to a lot of protests. There's a lot of wild people there.\n\nOh yeah. You've done some great interviews at those protests. Mm, yeah. It's just when they're confronted with a person who's actually asking them questions, it's remarkable how few people know why they're there. Mm. They don't, they don't know. Like when you get into specifics, this guy did this thing today where he was talking with people, the No Kings Pro.",

      "transcript_chunk": "paralysis tick. And they realized, she realized that between her and this other girl that looks after the, the puppy and we're not there, they'd got their dates mixed up. And so it wasn't actually covered for flea and tick, you know, stuff in its bloodstream. Mm. So very dangerous. So they had to shave the dog completely and everything. And they, they pulled off another couple of ticks, but there was only just the one paralysis tick. So it's okay. But if you leave that, and if you don't deal with it, the dog's gonna be dead in a minute.\n\nParalysis\n\nTick. Yeah. Yeah. It gets into their, into their body. And, and it is, it, it affects them the way the name says on the box, the\n\nParalysis. There's one that's going on in America now called, called the Well, what it, what it gives you. It's, it's a lone star tick is what what gives you this bite. And this produces something called Alpha Gal. And it makes you allergic to red meat. What? Yeah. It's my friend, my good friend Evan Fer. Got it. And he, he was allergic to red meat for a good solid year. And then eventually it went away. And then it came back again Recently. It's, it's a huge pain in the ass. So\n\nWe, we have ticks in Australia, but we've never had to deal with Lyme disease like you have here. Mm. But in the last, you know, four or five decades, people started raising deer in Australia for, for meat and what have you. And a few of them get away. You know, there's, there's no deer farms around where I am, which is north of Sydney by 600 Ks. But recently a couple of the guys that worked for me on the farm said they've seen deer going through the bush at the back of my block. You know, so that means that there's some just animals that have escaped, and they're most likely to have been in the southern highlands, which is south of Sydney. And somehow they've got themselves all the way up to where, where I am. How\n\nMany miles is that? Or kilometers?\n\nWell, we're probably talking about 700 something kilometers.\n\nThey just wandered. Yeah.\n\nWow. And, and didn't get run over or didn't get, you know, that's crazy.\n\nThat's\n\nAbsolutely.\n\nAnd they're probably bringing ticks,\n\nProbably and the wrong tics.\n\nYeah. In America, they have a problem with That too. Deer farms and this disease called chronic wasting disease, and it's spread throughout, large swaths of America have a giant issue with this, where deer herds get infected. My friend Doug Duran, he has a, a farm out in Wisconsin and they, they've had a significant problem with it to the point where they've started issuing more tags and thinning the herd. They're trying to kill more deer to try to lessen this spread of this stuff. Right. 'cause chronic wasting disease, it get, it's a PreOn disease, so it's like, it, it gets on plants. It has, it stays on them for a long time. So, and they start drooling when they have it. And in that drool is more chronic wasting disease. Right. So another deal will come along and graze on the ground where they drool, then they get it. Horrible, horrible disease. And a lot of it emanated from these deer farms\n\nWhen I first bought the farm, which was a hundred acres to start with, but it's now like 1700 and it's attached to a state forest as well. So I can get up behind my place and go for days. Oh wow. Which is just sort of like, you know, which is cool, but back in the day, we used to have platypus in the creeks. We had wombats, and now I see more foxes down. I see native animals, or I see an equivalent amount of foxes as I see wallabies\n\nAre foxes invasive. Yeah. Yeah. Okay.\n\nThere you go. And they're absolute, you know? Yeah. Because they eat anything and everything. Yeah. I used to have a big family of what we call bush turkeys living behind the house, and they're still there, but they used to just proudly walk around, you know? And, and it was fun. You'd going through the bush and then suddenly there's a road full of bush turkeys. It's great, you know, but now the population is right down and they're totally ninja now. You know, you don't see them very often when you do, they're like very suspicious. They checking you out, you know, he's just being\n\nHunted 24 7.\n\nIt's foxes, man.\n\nYeah. You also have a, a large feral cat problem,\n\nRight? Gigantic. Yeah, gigantic. The one and only cat that I let my mother have at the farm. This is way back man. I was training for Cinderella, man. And, you know, they sent me this group of boxes, Olympic guys and stuff like that. And every single one of 'em can smash the piss outta me in the ring. So I've gotta smash the piss outta 'em in other areas. So I train them until they drop, you know, getting them on bicycles and taking them to the bush, you know, and things like that. Just to sort of like, keep the balance, you know? Right. And this one particular day, and I had it in my mind that I was just gonna absolutely smash them. I was gonna get into this situation 'cause it's one road, you know? And I was just gonna get so far in front of them, psychologically damage them, you know what I mean?\n\nSo, and I, I just devious, yeah. Just\n\nHad a conversation with my mom and she was like, oh darling, you know, I, you know, I'd really love to have a cat. And I'm like, mom, we lived in this privileged situation. We've got sulfur, crested, cockatoos roses, king parrots, all these beautiful birds. And the worst thing that we could do for them is put a cat into that. So you can't have a cat. You know, I'm riding through the bush, 25, 30 Ks in at this point, right. I'm getting to the top of this hill. I'm looking down, I'm seeing these boys struggling quite some distance, probably about a kilometer and a half away from me, you know? And I'm going, good, I'll just have a little rest here. And I just hear this little noise and I'm like, what the hell is that? So I just take three or four steps off the road. You know, probably about seven or eight minutes ago, I was coming around this corner and a car was there on the road, which is kind of unusual for the state forest in that particular area. Right? So I take these three or four steps in and there's a little kitten sitting in the bush, like, what the hell? So I pick it up, it's warm, you know, I can't leave it here. So I, I put it in my backpack, right? And I complete the ride. I get to the top of this hill where this t trig station is, and everybody's standing around and I go, oh, I found a cat. You know? So I bring it out, everyone's, all these big boxes go, ooh, you know, cute little kitten. So I took it home to my mom. I said, okay, here's your cat. You know, and the way that I reasoned it is like, this is me saying to my mother, you cannot have something that will make you happy. And then the universe goes, listen to your mother. So, you know, that cat hated human beings for the rest of its life, you know? Wow. The only person it got on with was my mum. And we used to have like four bells around his neck. So to give the birds enough warning so it didn't cause too much damage. So\n\nWas a feral cat then,\n\nI think? Or was\n\nIt tossed outta that car?\n\nI think so, yeah.\n\nOh, it\n\nWas too clean and too warm for it to have been living. But that's what people do. That's, they have a problem. They have a cat that has a litter. They dunno how to solve it. Pet stores don't want it. Their friends don't want it. So they come up with the concept of just chucking them into the bush.\n\nWell, didn't it start out what they brought, they introduce cats to try to eliminate some other animal.\n\nWe have such a history of stupidity in that regard. Have you heard of the cane tote?\n\nYes. Yes.\n\nIt's just so fantastic. Right? Yeah. So, you know, they're growing sugar cane in Queensland and there's a particular flying creature that they want to control. So they start looking around. We always blame the British for this. 'cause it's usually, it's usually a naturalist, a British naturalist or scientist that comes up with the concept. And so they, they look through all the ahs, can't remember where they found it from, but they, they found this toad who seemed to have this appetite for this particular insect. And they would feed it, it ate at them. Great. So we'll introduce the cane toad to get amongst the sugar cane and lessen that creature. When they were checking if the cane toad would eat the creature, they were feeding it dead once. Right? It's a flying creature. Toad doesn't have a tongue like a frog. Can't catch this thing if it's flying. Oh. So, my God, it was of no use at all. Oh my God. In trying to lessen that com population. However, it became like a dominant species. And it was in Queensland, but now it's starting to come in New South Wales. So they're basically marching south. And it's a problem, man. It's, it's like a serious problem. They secrete poison. So if a dog gets interested and the toe gets afraid, the dog can sort of like sniff or lick its head, then get poisoned and that's the end of your dog, you know? But there was a period of time there where there's actually a documentary from the nineties called Cane Toads. And it sort of just points out how crazy people were getting with it. You know, people in a small country towns walking from their house to the pub, taking a cricket bat and just smacking the cane toes off the road as they went. You know, it's like all these people becoming like, you know, crazed with the idea of, of getting rid of the cane toe population. But it, it hasn't affected them. They just keep growing. How much\n\nIs the population now? How big is it?\n\nSo big? And these things, Jamie, can you do me a favor? Look up the weight of the largest cane toad that they found. Because it's, it's always a surprise. I mean, these things grow and if they're in the right environment and things that they can eat and feed on, they just get bigger and bigger. That's not the biggest. Look at this thing. Look at this thing, mate.\n\nWhoa. That's like an English bulldog.\n\nHowdy duty. It's bigger than my dog.\n\nOh my god. Bigger than one. My dogs look at his head. What is the weight on that fucker? What does it\n\nSay?\n\nThat's crazy.\n\nYep.\n\nI gotta find another one to add. Fuck me. Hold on.\n\nI gotta weight there.\n\nIt say how big\n\nThat was a record. Of course.\n\nIt's Oh, fat. That fucker is 2.7\n\nGrams. 5.8 pounds. Wow. That looks bigger than 5.8 pounds.\n\nIt does. But it might be a perspective thing either way. I said that\n\nWas the current one.\n\nOh. Show the video. Scroll up so you can see that video. Or make it larger, like when she's holding it. Yeah. It looks like about five pounds. Boy. Have you ever seen when they, there's a lot of horrible videos online where they take toads and they put 'em in a box with mice. You ever see what toads do to mice? No. You would never think that toads are ferocious. Right. You know, you'd never think that toads are basically monsters. These just giant mouth monsters that swallow mice's hole. But they do. They're super aggressive. It's crazy to watch. Jamie. I know you're gonna get one. I just had to\n\nMake sure it was worth pulling\n\nUp. Is this a good one? Yeah, but there's, there's ones where there's a bunch of 'em in boxes. See, this one is kind of weird because he's not freaking out yet.\n\nHe's being sneaky. Oh, what's that? Look at\n\nThat head. See him get excited. Look at his head. I mean, if that thing was giant, like that was a hippopotamus shaped chasing after you. Ah, look how quick that is. How did, how did he get it?\n\nHe must be closer than it\n\nLooks like. He just swallowed 'em whole. Yeah. Oh, watch how quick he does it. Yeah. This\n\nBit here. Oh, it's just one step forward and bang. Yeah,\n\nJust snap. Yeah. Go see if he could find one of them video. Oh, he just inhales them. Like, he literally inhaled him. He's got a little bit of a tongue. Oh, he, he grabbed him with the tongue first. Right? He yanked him in. Oh God. See if you can find those videos where there's a ton of them in a box.\n\nWe're getting two live feedings of the mice like this.\n\nEither way,\n\nThat's a giant bullfrog. It's not a cane to slightly different\n\nGiant African bullfrog either way. Point is they eat mice, they eat 'em whole. Right? And, and how many of 'em are now in Australia? How many million? Oh, here we go. This guy's just gonna go ham. It starts. Oh, he's gonna eat all of them. Look how gross those things are. They look so dumb. Just so mindless and, and gross.\n\nNo, I don't think he's gonna get all of 'em. Video's not long enough.\n\nHe hasn't gotten any of them. I can, what's going on here\n\nPast it,\n\nJust gathering them in a corner. Ugh.\n\nIt's, it's a creepy animal. So and so look, what are the numbers? Like, put that into perplexity\n\nCane toads.\n\nYeah. How many cane toads? Ask our sponsor, how many cane toads are in Australia? And what was the initial deposit? Like? How many They drop off that I had it,\n\nIt was only a couple hundred. And then they bred like 60,000 in 1937. And the answer for now is estimated at 200 million.\n\nMan. And that little flyer that eats the sugar cane, it's still there. Oh\n\nMy god. 200 million. Yeah.\n\nBut see, look, if you see where those that see that cluster of light blue balls, right? They basically in there, in the middle of that, that cluster is where they dropped them to start with. And look at how they've,\n\nWell they're gonna make their way across the whole\n\nCountry. Oh, there you go. 40, 49. So the white one is actually where they put them to start.\n\nWow.\n\nAnd everything else is migration.\n\nAnd by 2000, look how far they've gone. Mm. Wow. What's the plan to get rid of those things?\n\nI'm not sure that they have a cohesive plan. There's no\n\nPlan. Well, that's the problem. If they have a plan, they're gonna bring in some lizard or something. Yeah. In\n\nFrogs that's gonna end up gonna end up, you know, doing something else. Yeah. It's gonna\n\nKill everything\n\nElse. Every single time they've done that. You know, like in New Zealand for example, they introduced the goss bush as a way to have hedging instead of fences. But New Zealand's got a way higher rainfall and sunshine hours than England where it came from. So now it's just everywhere, you know. So beautiful arable farmlands just taken over by Gores. And when it grows in Australia, in New Zealand, it grows thicker and more prickly and much harder to, to deal with. We have the same thing in Australia with plants like Lantana just everywhere, all through the bush, you know, in my lifetime. So in 96 I used to be able to walk through certain areas of my property, just under tall trees with, you know, subtropical ferns and vines on the ground. Now there's many areas of my property that are just impossible. You cannot get through it anymore. 'cause it's choked out with introduced weeds.\n\nWhat is that crazy plant down south that we talked about Once that is overrun some of these forests, it's pretty beautiful, but it's also very creepy to see what it's done. Just like taken over all the trees, all the trees, all the, anything on the ground just covered wisteria. It, it's called kudzu. Kudzu. Yeah.\n\nI'll show you. I'll make sure this is the right stuff. That's\n\nWhat you're talking about? Yeah. That's it. Look at that. Right?\n\nIsn't\n\nThat nuts? Yeah.\n\nLike\n\nThat image is creepy. I mean, that's like a steaming\n\nAt the back of my place, man. I used to have that waterfalls and creeks.\n\nLook at that. It's taking over that whole building. That's crazy. Everything. Yeah. Just where'd they come from?\n\nSee, that's in Fiji.\n\nYeah, it's in the United States though. So what was it, how was it brought in?\n\nChina, Korea, Japan.\n\nOh, did people bring it in on purpose? That's\n\nWhere it's, that's where it's originated from.\n\nSorry. Right. History of us introduction introduced from Japan in 1876. Yeah. New Orleans Exposition. Oh, that's where I heard there's a lot of it. Vine was widely marketed in the southeast as an ornamental plant, and then it just took\n\nOver California.\n\nWow. It's, it's funny when people try to do that.",

You pick 'em up, you take 'em, throw 'em in the wagon, bring them to Skid Row, and then keep 'em there. Don't let 'em leave. Just contain them in an area. And that's essentially what they did. There's a documentary on that hotel. What is that hotel again? Jamie Cecil, Cecil Hotel where it talks about Skid Row itself. Like it's, the documentary is about this girl who was, they thought that she was missing, that someone had kidnapped her or something, but she was schizophrenic. She got off her medication and she apparently climbed into the water cistern and drowned. But the point of the documentary was not just that, it's like this lady came here not knowing what downtown was. Mm. And so she got a room at the hotel downtown thinking, oh, get a nice room at a hotel downtown, but like, it's fucking Zombie Boulevard. It's crazy. Show him what, what Skid Row looks like. Show him a video of what Skid Row looks like. Now, when we were filming Fear Factor, this was like 2004 ish, something like that. I accidentally drove through Skid Row. I drove to Skid Row. I was driving home back then, I think I probably had navigation on my, my, my car. It probably sucked. Or I wasn't paying attention to it. And this is skid row, skid row's, nuts. Jesus. This is close up. When you, when you have like a, like when you see it from a distance, you get a chance to see how completely insane it is. When we were filming, there was another fear factor we filmed there where one of the contestants was like, look, they're smoking crack. And we looked down and there was people, we were like on a rooftop or something. And then we looked down, people were smoking crack right in front of us. Right on the street. Like chaos, like skid rows, nuts. And this is, this is not even where the tents are set up, the where the tents are set up. It's the craziest thing you've ever seen. It's like these shanty villages that go on for blocks and blocks where there's no cars going through the streets are filled with homeless people. Just, everyone's on drugs and there's just tents everywhere. And you're like, what a failure of society. Yeah. What a failure of society that you've allowed this to reach the level that it's at now. That's la\n\nHave you been to Tokyo?\n\nYes, I have.\n\nYeah. I mean, Tokyo's the complete opposite.\n\nComplete opposite, you know, super clean, very orderly. People are very polite. Yep. Even though there's so many people in the street, everybody sort of navigates, moves around of each other in a very polite manner. You know, A beautiful architecture. Yeah. Stunning. Like cyber punk, as you said. Yeah. Very Blade Runner esque. Like, yo Talk, I was only there for one day for the UFC, so I didn't spend a lot of time there, but I got a, I had dinner there and I hung out there for a little bit. I was\n\nLike, this is crazy. You know, it really shows you that it is possible to have a very large densely populated city that is safe and clean and functioning. It doesn't have to be, people say, oh, you know, I got robbed. It's just part of being in a big city. Or I was stabbed last night, or my car was broken into. And it's, ugh, this is just what happens when you live in a big city, man. And it's like, actually no, it is possible to have safe and clean. And, and, and Tokyo's fascinating because it's, it's an example of what's often called an, an emergent city. They don't have this very strict zoning where, oh, here it's gotta be offices here. It's gotta be houses here. It's gotta be small businesses or anything like that. It's like you, it's all mixed together. And, and different kind of neighborhoods kind of just emerged. You know, there's a knife district, for example. Mm. People who sell knives, they all gather together. There's a bookshop district, there's a, you know, districts for all different things because they not because someone has decided, oh, only bookshops can be here. It's just that they tend to gather together. Right. And so you, you know, you walk around Tokyo and you might, you'll find yourself in some quiet alley and you'll have little houses, and then you'll have a little store, often very, very tiny stores that have been perhaps operating for, for decades. And the if in the uk, or I guess in, in the States as well, they would've gone under decades ago. You know, the city would've just crushed them. Right. But it's, it's, it seems very easy in, in Tokyo to kind of open a small, if you have a house and you own it in Tokyo, you can, by law, you can, you can convert the, the first floor into a store. You'll get these little old ladies who will, they bought their house decades ago. They're retired. And they think, oh, what can I do with my time? I know I'll open a cafe. And they say they, they open a little cafe. Hardly anyone goes. Maybe it might be, it could be in the countryside, it could be on the outskirts or whatever, but it doesn't matter. 'cause they own it. And they're not being raped by, you know, taxes and stuff and all right. And, and all this kind of red tape. They don't have to deal with it. So they just have this lovely little cafe, entirely unique. They might fill it with things they're interested in. So it's, it's a completely unique thing that you can go in and she'll serve you tea. And maybe the cakes that she, she made this morning. And there are thousands of these throughout Tokyo. Not just little old ladies, but young people who own, who will rent very cheaply. They have these, have you seen in Tokyo, when you see the buildings, you often see these, these neon signs coming down the sides of the building. These are called Zao, which is basically miscellaneous use buildings. And, and what they are is just very tall buildings. And each floor you will have some kind of business. It could be anything. It's often bars or, you know, pool rooms or that anything you want, little restaurant, anything like this. And, and of course they can't, they don't have the, the frontage on the ground floor. And so they, instead they will put their, their sign, neon sign telling you what they are down the side of the building. And that's what gives Tokyo that unique look is because it's all of these Zao buildings. Mm. And sometimes if you go, A friend took me to this bar. Well, it was, it was like a, a building. It was in Kabuki Cho, which is right in the center of Tokyo. And it was, but it was on a side street. And there was this tall building, gray building. You would never look at it, no signage or anything. And you look at the, the elevator, when you go into the elevator that on each floor there's like a, a name of a business, you know, top hat eight Ball Enigma. You have no idea what these are. They're not on Google Maps. Right. So, and he just took, pressed the button for the eighth floor. He went up and it was just this little bar run by this one guy. And it was, you know, it played darts and had a drink. And a few people came in. Not many, because no, most people, most people, 99.89% of the population of Tokyo have no idea that this bar exists. Nor could they ever know, because it's not on Google Maps. There's no reviews of it. It doesn't exist. And I couldn't find it again, unless I call my friend and say, take me there. I can never go to that bar again. Ever. Because I, I dunno where it is. Right. And there's thousands of these. It's like,\n\nThat sounds amazing. Yeah. I want to go right now. Yeah.\n\nBut you gotta take a risk because if you just go, if you don't know. Right, right. And you just press the button, you could be some weird girls bar, you know, host bar, you know, and they, they kind of rip you off and stuff. There's a lot of danger in going to these places. Well,\n\nThere's a lot of Yakuza, right?\n\nThere's a lot of Yakuza in Kabuki show. Yeah, yeah. You gotta be very careful. 'cause they will drug you and then they will take you to a cash machine and,\n\nYou know, take your liver. Yeah. There's a lot of crazy stories. But when you see that and you live like that, like what keeps the rest of the world from having a city like that?\n\nThat's a really good question. And I don't wanna get, well, I don't know, but I think culture is everything. You know, obviously a city is all about the people. You've, of course, you've gotta have the infrastructure and you've gotta have, it's gotta be properly funded, but you also need the people that are going to take care of it. If you, people are trashing it and don't have respect for the city, then obviously it's gonna fall apart. But it's all about the culture. Ja. Japan is fascinating. The culture. I always say to people, when you go to Japan, you have to switch your mindset. So normally as a westerner, I'm thinking about me. When I'm out in public, I'm thinking about me. What do I want to do? Where do I want to go? It's all me. In Japan, you flip that. It's about you should, the first thing on your mind should be everybody else. When you hear Japanese people talk, you will about people who cause problems in cities, they use this word ku, which means often translated as nuisance. So people who come from the west, often America, but not just America, I'm not blaming everything on Americans, but it is often, and they come with their own, you know, they're, they're the main character, this kind of main character syndrome. Right. So they, you know, they're talking, they often, you see these Instagram videos of people on, on the, the metro, on the train. And they like, it's so quiet, you know, nobody's talking or nobody's kind of listening to music. And that's because they're always thinking about the people around them. They are thinking, you know, am I obstructing anyone? Am I getting any anyone's way? Am I annoying anyone? Am I making anyone feel uncomfortable? You are always thinking about those around you. And that leads to this very respectful, polite society where you can have 40, you know, 37 million people, whatever it is, crammed together, together in this relatively small area of land. And they're not killing each other. They learn, I was told, I'm not sure if this is true, but there's kind of a, I dunno if it's a myth, but Japan is very mountainous. And so back in the old days, villages were isolated. So when you lived in a village to get to the next village, you have to climb a mountain. Right? So you're trapped in your village. And so you have to learn to get along with the people around you. You can't run away. Mm. And and so the Japanese culture has developed in the sense that you are, you always have to be aware of the people around you. And, and that's, that's been passed down into the modern age, that the culture is always one of thinking about others and, and, and, and respect from a, from an early age.\n\nThat's what's so fascinating is like, how come no one else figured that out? And also what's really strange is Japan itself right now is in the midst of population collapse. Yeah. Sadly. So that's what sucks. It's like you could lose this and it could be overwhelmed by the west. Like, because of the fact that they aren't having enough people to reproduce successfully to maintain their population. It could just be taken over, like in terms of immigration. Like Americans could just move there and Europeans can move there. And then all the beautiful aspects of this very interesting and very unique culture Yeah. Could go away.\n\nAnd they are really concerned about that. When I was, when I was first, when I first arrived in Japan, like 10 years ago, I was worked at a university and I was stood on, on campus outside just talking to someone. And I saw a couple of, like, they looked like high school students probably on a, a campus visit outta the corner, my eye, Japanese high school students. And they, they caught my eye. They, they saw that I was looking at them. And as soon as that happened, they both like on a dime stopped and bowed to me. And I thought, wow. Wow. We're not in Kansas anymore. Wow. You know, and that, that having that teaching children about respect from a very, and, and, and training them, you know, the idea of respect your elders. This is, you know, we have this in the west as well, but we kind of lost it a little bit. Yeah. And it's kind of drilled into them about respecting the people around you and respecting people who are older than you. And this probably goes back to the samurai, you know, these hierarchies.\n\nYes. Yeah. I'm sure. Mm. I'm sure. Just, and then you, you think about like how crazy futile Japan was and that it eventually evolves to what it is now. This incredibly safe society. Yeah, exactly. Which is really kinda nuts. Yeah. Do you think about one of the most war-like cultures of all time? Yeah. The culture that fought off the Mongols successfully, you know, pretty nuts.\n\nYeah. Yeah, it is. And and, but you see it, you see the remnants of that kind of, the ancient societal structure. Even in the language, when you learn Japanese, there are several levels of politeness. Oh, right. You have, so it's really complicated. But you have something called cago, which is kind of formal or polite speech. And if you are talking to, if you are lower down and you are talking to someone above you, you have to speak in a different, even the words, the verbs are different. The words are different. Mm. And if you are speaking about them, then you have to use what's called honorific la you are elevating them. If you are talking about someone higher up, you have to elevate them. You use honorific language. Mm. If you're talking about yourself to someone who's higher up, you use humble language. So you lower yourself down. So you, so it's very difficult, you know, it's still, I still kind of struggle with it, but, and, and it actually causes some problems because it's very difficult for junior people to communicate with senior people to communicate honestly, at least. So they just, you get a lot of it like, yes, men, yes, I agree. You know? Oh, yes, I agree with that. You kind of agreeing with everything that the senior person says. And that's not a way to, to make good decisions. It's by just agreeing. And so they have something called communication. So this is formed from two words, communication, of course, plus namu, which is the Japanese word to drink. And they're talking about alcohol. So Japan, in Japan, alcohol is king, and society is actually lubricated by alcohol and functions because of alcohol.",

      "transcript_chunk": "eople than cigarettes.\n\nThat funny thing that we have that was fed to us that, you know, cigarettes are this incredible burden on our health healthcare system. In reality, if you look at it, it's a burden. But, you know, there's a lot of people dying of lung cancer who've never had a cigarette. So we haven't really solved that. We don't really know where that's coming from. But in reality, the burden on our healthcare system is obesity and all the problems that come from obesity. That's the biggest. Yeah. We allow food production systems that we know to be extremely unhealthy and very bad. We just allow them to continue on. You know, we've got items of quote unquote food that have been tested and turns out there's no actual food in this. It's just, you know, a manufactured product. I think the, the famous one here was the, the Twine thing. Right? When they actually got around to looking at what was in a twine, they realized that every single part of it was completely unhealthy. Yeah.\n\nIt's just mostly sugar, right? Yeah. Yeah. But Twinkies are delicious and I think you should be able to buy Twinkies, you know what I mean? So I, I'm on both sides of it. I'm a healthy person. I eat 99% of my food is very healthy, but I think you should be able to do whatever the fuck you want. It's just education is the most important thing. And letting people know what they're, and then teaching people some discipline and how to be able to exercise some control over yourself.\n\nSo I was 126 kilos when I finished Nuremberg.\n\nMm.\n\nI'm a hundred 0.9 right now.\n\nThat's amazing. Congratulations. Well,\n\nA lot of that.\n\nYou look great by the way. Thanks. Really do\n\nA lot of that is because you introduced me to your mate Brigham\n\nFrom Waist Towell. Yeah. Yeah.\n\nAnd so I've probably connected with them about five times since that first time we went. And the real benefit that I'm getting that I think, right, because I'm not, not completely over the science, but it seems to be with these injections that I've been getting into my shoulders, into my knees, but also IVs that it's calmed down my body's inflammation. You know, I think we talked before about just how many old injuries I carry, you know, and how like the injuries in my shoulders have a deeply arthritic, but we can now see in an ultrasound over time how, what was messy a year ago and like big thick bands of of arthritis now it's just lessened. You know, probably by about 70% on one area of my right shoulder, probably about 90%. So my range of motion, if we'd done this last year, would've been about there. Right. But now is fucking rock and roll something, you\n\nKnow what I mean? Isn't that great? It's all\n\nGoing good, you know? I know. It's amazing. And like, just feeling like the musculature starting to build and everything. I'm taking it really slowly. And that was one of the things I was worried about with Highlander because jumping into that role with the shooting date coming, it was like, man, I've gotta do, I've gotta do three workouts a day. I gotta, you know, and that for me is a bad recipe because yeah, I can, I can do that for X amount of time, but once I stop, I'm gonna stop completely. You know? And what I want to do is I wanna make all these changes and make it a long-term situation. So I think the Waste two world was a great call for me because it's calmed down a bunch of stuff. It's taken a bunch of pain away, you know, so I can go and work out and not have to suffer for two or three hours afterwards. Yeah. You know, you know, I'm still picking up injuries 'cause I've gotta face the fact I'm 61. Yeah. You know, like the other day I'm doing my cat guitar dinosaur trying to get this fricking move going on. A fricking tore the tendon here on the ulnar. Ugh. So that's gonna be bad for sword fighting, but I'm trying to fix that without having to have a, a surgical,\n\nHow bad is it torn?\n\nIt's only a little bit really, you know. Okay.\n\nYou just gotta make sure you don't overuse it while it's healing. Can you brace it? Well\n\nThe, the, the problem I've got is I've got X amount of time to claim the skill and either way, right. If I do the rehab exercises without doing surgery, if it fails, I'm now falling right on production and you know, of re torn or something. Right.\n\nBut I can help you with that. Just do this skill slowly.\n\nYeah.\n\nHere's the thing about skills. Skills that you learn slowly. You can translate into high speed quickly. Yeah. Because you develop a neural pathway. So instead of using an actual sword, use a foam sword use like one of those little fucking noodle things that people put in the pool. Use that. So you're just, just develop them. When I was teaching martial arts, one of the things that I always tell people is don't try to do it quickly when I show you something, I want you to do it slowly.\n\nThat's exactly what I did. Yeah. I'm in a car park and we were talking about the speed of something and I went, oh yeah, so you get sh and I went, oh fuck.\n\nAnd I\n\nKnew I to, but I just put my sword away and I kept the conversation going. Didn't mention it, but I got home and I was like, oh fuck.\n\nOh, you rushed, you didn't warm up. Yeah.\n\nWell the thing is we were warm, but it was a thing that I just, just in that split second, I thought, I wonder what it's like to go full speed. Oh. And I did it and I, and I just like, no way too early. But you're absolutely right. Pace is deceptive. Yeah. If you learn something, I mean, you know, that's like that old fashioned sort of stuff with with with the karate I first did when I was a kid, you know, they aim for you to do 10,000 of something before you have to use it in an actual competitive fight. You know?\n\nYeah. People who train people with guns have a saying, slow is smooth, smooth is fast.\n\nRight? Yeah.\n\nYeah. Absolutely. You want herky jerky movements and with martial arts and specifically sword fighting, it's, there's very specific movements that you're learning. And if you learn those movements slow as you speed up, you'll be going along the right pathway. And when I would teach people kicks in particular because it's a weird thing to learn how to kick something. Like you've gotta do it slowly. 'cause if you try to muscle it, you're gonna develop a bad habit that's gonna keep you from achieving full power because you want a proper technique. Yeah. And\n\nYou have to process where your balance is. Yeah. You know, what you, how you're pushing your force, but how you retain Yeah. You know, the ability to reset. Yeah.\n\nYeah. Juujitsu as well. People that learn by drilling, they get way better, way quicker by doing it flowing and doing it more easy and play like the Gracie's always say keep it playful. Yeah.\n\nLike that's, well see the thing is I know all this stuff, but I was in such a point of weariness that I was just trying to please people. Right. Oh. And so I muck myself up and you know, but I've got a bit of time now for it to heal and for me to start and actually do like, I like to do, you know,\n\nHave you visited Brigham while you're here?\n\nYeah. Yeah. I saw him missed that. Okay, great. Yeah, he's looking great.\n\nYeah, he looks great, right? Yeah. He is looking good.\n\nHe'll look you up the new, the new place. And now here's the thing. We talk about this and your listeners would probably, you know, it's expensive. No two ways about it. So it's possibly not at everybody's grasp what the sort of things that I'm doing. But I think, I'm not sure if this is absolutely right, but I think, you know, one of his sort of fervent ambitions Brigham, is to make it more available. Yes. You know, because this should be, this is cutting edge medicine. Yes. You know, if we can sort of write things in our bodies with an injection as opposed to an operation, you know, the problem I had in my left shoulder, I go and see my shoulder surgeon who fixed it while I was doing Cinderella, man. And so I did two operations with this guy, one in 2001 and the second one in 2004. But it's always had a sort of problem. And, and he did say at the time, after the second operation, that he had to cut a few corners and it would probably cause me problems later on in life. So I probably went to see him about five or six years ago and he said, okay, so you are, this shoulder is at a point of arthritis. Now what we have to do is we have to cut through the muscle bar, we have to pop out the humeral head of your arm bone. We have to shave off the top of the humal head and then we have to put a carbon fiber cap and then we have to put it back in. So everything back up, you've got about 12 months of rehab. Right. Just sounds wrong. You know, it just sounds wrong. It's like, you know, so this process that I've been going through with Brigham, basically having the effect of layering so I can now see that if the arthritis was that deep, it's now this deep, you know, it's still there. I haven't solved it yet, but I'm giving my body what it needs to make it better.\n\nAlso, there's new breakthroughs almost every week, right. And these new breakthroughs, they're, they're able to achieve the, the, they're, they're growing actual cartilage on people that were bone on bone. Right? So they're, they're developing new methods to regenerate tissue. That's the cushioning in between your, your knees and your elbows and all these things that were, and shoulders that we're requiring people to get those horrific things. Putting an artificial joint in place. 'cause everything is so arthritic.\n\nThat's one of the things that does trouble me greatly in for this country health medical systems to benefit everybody. Something has perverted here where, you know, the drug that I might need that I can buy for $50 for a month supply in Australia is two and a half thousand dollars for a month here. Yeah. Come on man. I know what's going on. It's crazy. You know, and where's, see you've got all these elected representatives here and this country's got, you know, a lot, you know, that's what you should be working on man. You know? Yeah.\n\nBut they can't\n\nBecause everybody's got their, their hands\n\n500 back. Everybodys their hands tied. Yeah. They're all got their, including the media. That's the crazy things. The amount of money they spend on advertising for the media that really just serves the purpose of now the media can't criticize the pharmaceutical drug companies. Right.\n\nWild. Yeah. Wild. It's interesting. It's because, you know, I get back here as you know, you know, my girlfriend's from New Orleans and you know, we're sitting and watching TV here and she's now seeing America from the outside. 'cause she spends most of the time traveling with me. And we don't spend that much time in, within America. You know, we live in Australia, but we've been, I've been working mainly in, in, in Europe the last few years. So she's now coming back to her country, but she's got fresh eyes and she's sitting there the other night she was watching something. She came out, she said, I've just watched like 12 ads for drugs. Right. Just one after the other, after the other, after the other. You know what, what's this tiny little problem that you might have? Or you know, if I can say it in a certain way to make you think that you've got it, bang, I got a drug for it. Bang, bang. You know? And yeah. I mean 600,000 plus people in this country in the next 12 months will go bankrupt because of their medical bills. You know how many people will go bankrupt in Australia because of their medical bills in the next 12 months?\n\nZero. Zero.\n\nYeah.\n\nYeah. It's one of the biggest problems we have. You know, and the idea that you would let that happen and not do anything about it because you're bought and paid for by these enormous companies is kind of insane. Yeah. It's insane.

      "transcript_chunk": ". That's a drone. They're\n\nSo\n\nBad. Put in my yard by China.\n\nMy husband is probably dying out there that I even brought this. He's like, are you talking my soup? Our chicken. So I'm just being there. He's like cooking and I'm just like, I'm painting my chickens right now. Always\n\nChickens.\n\nI don't know why. I have no idea. It's easy. That's why. Fate. It's\n\nFate. You're designed to be the greatest folk. Art chicken.\n\nThat's my next song. Folk art. Fake painter\n\nOf all time. Folk art fate. Imagine if that's what it is. Like there's something that compelling. You tell the world about chicken folk art.\n\nI guess. So. Here\n\nWe go. You watch chick. Do you have chickens?\n\nYeah, I do have chickens. I have\n\nChickens.\n\nI love chickens.\n\nChickens are great.\n\nRight? They're awesome.\n\nThey're really cute. They're the ladies. I go in the yard like, hi\n\nLadies. The ladies. That's why I call 'em. I say, Hey ladies, I give them all the scraps. They love everything from the table. Like any leftovers. It's funny to watch 'em though 'cause they're like picky. Like the other day I thought they would eat like leftover breakfast. Casserole wouldn't touch it really? But they were all, they didn't eat the biscuits. Chickens don't like biscuits.\n\nWell, maybe they know that breakfast casserole is eggs and they're like, Jesus Christ, this lady's fucking nuts. She's trying to turned us into cannibals.\n\nRidiculous. Because I didn't think about that.\n\nRight. Maybe it's like,\n\nOh no, what have I done to my ladies?\n\nIt might be like a natural reaction to them. I'll tell you what they go crazy for is mice. Have you ever seen what, oh yeah. Yeah. So this is how I found out. I used to have a house in California that my wife, she changed our back fence. It was a wrought iron fence. And she changed it to glass. And when she did, she, she signed a death warrant for a bunch of hawks. And they kept slamming into that fucking glass. And like three of them died in our yard. And one of them got kd but survived. And I was on the road and she had told me about it. And they'd taken this, this hawk and they had put it in a box. And when I got back we got 'em what's called pinkies. And what pinkies are, are these little baby mice that have, they feed 'em to lizards and snakes. Like that's what they're for. Like when you go to the pet store, they sell you these things. They're not weaned from their mother. And you feed 'em the snakes. I know it's dark. So they, they bought a bunch of 'em and fed this hawk, these little baby mice. And it ate all of them except one. And my daughters were very young at the time and they're like, we wanna keep that mouse. We wanna raise it. I'm like, honey, you can't, it's not gonna live. Like it's not weaned from its mother. It won't survive. I go, I'm just gonna go see if the chickens will eat it. I put this thing down and these chickens attacked like they were raptors from Jurassic Park. One chicken grabbed it and they all chased her around. They were\n\nStealing it from what in the world are you saying?\n\nPulling it out of her mouth? It is the, they are so ferocious. Like you've never seen anything like a chicken with a mouse.\n\nI have never heard this in my life.\n\nI'm gonna show you a video. And this video, oh, do I wanna see this? There's a bunch of videos of cats with mice. So, so this is a mouse. And why, why do these chickens? My god. They just kill this mouse. And look, they all attack each other trying to steal the mouse away from the one chicken. And has it, do they eat? Oh, they eat it quick. Yeah, they devour it. Hmm. So there's another mouse in there that they don't know about yet. So see there's one with a cat. So the cat is playing with the, the mouse. Like, you know, cats don't kill it or an they wanna play. And this chicken just runs over and snatches it from the cat. Like,\n\nFuck you. I have never heard this in my life. So\n\nLook, the cat has a mouse and chicken's like, gimme that bitch. They just go, look, it's got a mouse. And the cat's like, Jesus Christ, you guys are psychos.\n\nWell, who knew? Yeah.\n\nWell because they're dinosaurs. That's who they are. They're just dinosaurs that are really small that survive the impact of the asteroid.\n\nI also love dinosaurs, so maybe that's why. That's it. Chickens. I'm called to paint my folk chicken.\n\nYou just don't realize how ruthless they are until\n\nYou see, I've never heard this in my life. This is blowing 'em. I'm country as a bump. And like I've never heard this. They\n\nDestroy mice. Yeah. Dang. Destroy 'em. They love 'em. They tear 'em apart.\n\nWell, I'm not gonna go do that, but I'm glad I know that now.\n\nLike nothing I've ever seen before. We also saw a mouse that got loose in the chicken coop once they, we had a big chicken coop and a mouse went in there and I saw these chickens just tear that mouse\n\nUp. Well the ma casserole is not offensive to them\n\nEating their own babies.\n\nThey're not, we don't have a rooster.\n\nWell I know, but they don't know that you're right. You know, they brooded sometimes\n\nI think baby know. I just let 'em sometimes. And I'm like, do you? Well I just like, sometimes they look at me like, let me just sit on this. Like, like, okay, you can have it. That's your egg out.\n\nYeah. But they pluck their feathers out.\n\nI know. They, it's a lot.\n\nThey get real. They get real. It, it makes you sad. It's like they wanna be a mommy. They do. Yeah. And you don't let 'em, we had a rooster once, but he did not last.\n\nI do not enjoy having roosters. They're roosters soul\n\nFuckers. They're me. Yeah. He attacked my wife and she's like, we're done. Me\n\nToo. Mine attack me. I'm out on rooster.\n\nYeah, they're they're assholes. Yeah. And but they're doing it because they're trying to protect their hens. Like they don't know that you're okay. No, they just think this big fucking thing is moving around their hens. Like this giant person\n\nThing. They're also mean to the hint. Real mean. They're they're mean brutal. Ripping their feathers out. I'm like, I can't do it.\n\nYeah. They're nasty. They're,\n\nHow many do y'all have? Chickens?\n\nWe have 15. 15 or\n\n16. Y'all name 'em.\n\nYes. I don't name 'em, but my daughter girls and my wife names them. But the rooster, he, we only let him got, he got to maturity and then we gave him to a friend. We're like, this motherfucker can't, no, I was gonna kill him. They're mean.\n\nYeah.\n\nHe attacked me. I went into the, I was like, you just gotta like, show him who's boss. And he is like, no, no, you're not boss. I'll attack you too, bitch. Yeah, exactly. He attacked me and I was like, bitch, like it. I'll fucking kill you. And so to avoid killing him, I gave him away. Well that's good because I was totally ready to kill him. Yeah. Because when I'd go in there, he'd face off against me and just leap at me and\n\nAt\n\nMe. Every\n\nYeah. Might, might attack me too. And dad dealt with it. I don't know what happened to him, but dad dealt with it.\n\nSoup. Turned with the soup. Yeah. That's the thing about roosters too. I guess he can't like just outright eat 'em. They're really tough. So if you do kill 'em, you gotta like, either slow cook 'em or turn 'em into soup.\n\nWell we, we probably did. He didn't tell me\n\nI had a landscaper back when I lived in LA who he used to fight chickens and he took me over his place once.\n\nI hate that.\n\nIt was crazy.\n\nI hate it. Yeah.\n\nHe had like a hundred, a hundred roosters.\n\nWe have done some boxers my nation has done. We're not just, we don't just help dogs. We help all animals. But dogs are focused. But like we've helped break up some chicken rings the past. It's\n\nKind of the crazy that it's still, it's still around.\n\nIt's awful. There's some, it's always out. Like we have a farm in Tennessee and there's a whole, this is whole farm like down the road and it's, they keep him in tiny cages. I just hate it. And every time we report him, every time they just pay the fine. You know what I mean?\n\nWell, it's a part of the culture that's the problem. And they all gamble on it. I know he was Mexican and you know, from Mexico and he had all these friends that lived in this neighborhood where he lived in like, you might as well have been in Mexico. It was crazy. Everything was in Spanish. And when I went over his place, it's like his buddy, we went over his buddy's place. His buddy had like a hundred cages in the backyard in a pit where they would take the roosters. Awful. Yeah. And they put spurs on 'em. So they put\n\nThese like, it's so terrible. I mean, knives\n\nOn their claws.\n\nWe, we try to like, we got to be part of like some of the But when you confiscate like that many they use mean Yeah. I mean you can't Yeah. And reintroduce them into the world. Like Right. You know what I mean? They're taught to be mean. They're bred for that.\n\nYeah. And they'll br they'll breed champion roosters from champion other roosters.\n\nLet's just stick to our little backyard hens. How about that?\n\nYeah. It's just, it's a weird thing because like their, their culture has been, they fight them and then they take the loser and they cook 'em. Yeah. And you know, he was making it seem like it was no big deal. And it was like, to them it was their gambling recreation. Yeah. They would all gather around and guys would come from long distances to bring their chickens to fight.\n\nI hate it.\n\nYeah. To me it doesn't freak me out as much as dog fighting. Dog fighting drives me nuts. 'cause pit bulls are the, they're look, they're very dangerous because they have a very high parade drive and they often don't, they confuse children with other animals. They don't. But as pets, they are the most loyal. They're just, they're the most\n\nLoving,\n\nThey're sweetest\n\nKind.\n\nThey love you to death. They love you so much. But there's so many bad ones and so many ones that are raised just to fight. And that part of our culture, that part of society, like the the underground dog fighting part is like, how can you do that to a dog? Like how can you do that to the best animals? Yeah. It's the scum\n\nOf the earth is what it is. I feel like I have some friends that are huge into pit bull rescue and when they're either rehabilitated or just they get a bad rap period. Right. Like, like say any, any metro shelter you go to, it's 90% pit bulls because people are afraid. Yeah. But they're, they get such a bad reputation. But there are some amazing pities that weren't ever in the fighting greens. Right. They were just overbred and you know, you know, taking it out of a confiscation of a, of a hoarding situation or breaking up the fighting rings and it's the mama dog that's just been having puppies and like Yeah. I just wish people would at least open their minds and hearts to like, there are some amazing pities out there or pity mixes. You know, there\n\nAre, but there are also very dangerous. I\n\nGet it. I know they are. They\n\nGo around other dogs. They will fight those dogs to the death.\n\nI think you're, that's the problem. They have to be vetted. It has to be a well vetted shelter or adoption. You know.\n\nBut the problem is oftentimes you don't know their behavior until they're around other dogs. Yeah. Like I've had dogs that were great around people. Yeah. And I get them around any dog and their hackles would go up and they immediately wanted to fight. Yeah. And you're like, oh god. And then you're the asshole. 'cause your dog is like pulling on the leash and you're like, I'm sorry. Let me get 'em outta here.\n\nRight. I know.\n\nThey, they're dangerous. They're dangerous in that regard because they really are bred to fight. And\n\nI think it takes a special household and owner too to really Yes. Kind of handle a dog like that. Like\n\n100%.\n\nOur best friends, Gwen, she's in my band and her and her husband are long time pit bull rescue family. And he, they just know how to like deal with them and they come around our dogs, they're fine, everything's fine. But it's definitely an alpha male out. Like they kind of show 'em who boss right away and Yeah. And they sort of understand the food chain of the house. You know what I mean?\n\nYeah. There's dogs that are great dogs, but they just need a lot of attention. Like if you have a German shepherd Yeah. Or a Belgium malis, you gotta give those things something to do.\n\nYeah. You gotta know what kind of breed you're getting too. Yeah. Like I feel like people, I always preach, adopt, don't shop. But I still think you within the adoption, like really need to go, I'm gonna spend some time with this dog. I'm gonna talk to his foster family. I'm gonna foster it. Just to really understand what kind of breed you're getting. If you want like a lazy, cuddly thing, but still protect or kid a Pyrenees. You know what I mean? Right. Just know what you're getting. Like just understand like as my household ready. 'cause there's a lot of the, what breaks my heart the most is the like owner surrenders and the returns Yeah. At the shelters. You know what I mean? It's like Yeah. You didn't think through what you were right doing and\n\nThen the dog already thought it had a home and now\n\nYou bring 'em in. Right. Because you did. You wanted a lazy dog and you got a cow dog and it needs to run like\n\nGreat. Pyrenees are great because they're kind of a combination of like a lab and a protector dog. Yes. They're a great little balance. Yeah. Like I have a friend who has a Pyrenees and it's like such a good dog. And he's like, listen man, if coyotes come around here, this fucking dog. Oh\n\nYeah. We're not, we're\n\nNot fo them up. Yep. I go, really? And he goes like, oh yeah. Like you, you ain't never seen a change of personality like this dog when it sees a coyote,\n\nBut then they're like laid up on the couch, the legs in air. Oh, the\n\nSweetest. Just rub my bat under your knee.\n\nHe is the best.\n\nLike a re like I have a golden who's he's the best. Unless you're a squirrel. And then he's, he's hell\n\nThen he's\n\nHe then he is a demon. Yep. Exactly. He's, he's squirrel killer. But other than that he's the sweetest boy. He's just so nice to everybody. Everybody who comes over the house, like you're my best friend.\n\nGoldens are the best.\n\nThey're so sweet.\n\nBut I love 'em all. I love 'em all. We have a chihuahua. I mean, I, I mean you, you getting a chihuahua, you know what you're getting. Yeah. Mean as hell\n\nAnd nervous.\n\nOh my God. I mean she's 16 and blind and she still tries to bite. She don't know where you are. But she's like, but I could get you,\n\n16 is old\n\nAnd blind is a bat. But\n\nYou know. Oh my god.\n\nSenior dog house over here.\n\nHave you had her since she was a baby? Yep.\n\nWow. We doctor her from a shelter when she was like eight weeks old. Aw. We got two seniors now. But seniors I've lost. I was crazy dog lady when my husband met me and I had eight rescues, like wow. It seems crazy now. But it, I have farm and land and three were Pyrenees, two golden mixes and then three little, I don't know what's, and I've lost one every year for six years. And so after this, we have two seniors left. And my husband's like, my heart can't take this. Like he never had dogs growing up. Oh, he loves dogs. But he was like, this is awful. Like ever since we met, we've lost one. 'cause they're stair step in age and Yeah. So I'm like, I need a, my heart needs a break a little bit. It's hard.\n\nYeah. It's hard when they die. It's like, it's, it's so hard. So close to them. And they only lived like to\n\nBe 15, not long enough.\n\n15 or 13. And then it's over.\n\nThey're like, put here to show us true love. I know. They really are.\n\nMeanwhile they're not, meanwhile what they are is like, that's wild. I'm in, we took wolves and turned them into bitches. That's what really, really what happened. Like I have a King Charles spaniel. You know one of those. He's the sweetest. That's my little\n\nCharlie. Is that Charlie? Okay. That's\n\nCharlie. Charlie. He is the sweetest. He's so cute. You pick him up, he just kisses your face. He's just so adorable. That was a wolf at one time.",

      "transcript_chunk": "changed course. Did you see that Jamie? No. Avi Loeb said something today. I'll send it to you. I know. It's on Reddit rapidly\n\nBrightens and gets blue.\n\nHere you go, Jamie. I'll send it to you right now. It's fascinating. It's fascinating also because it's made almost entirely of nickel, whatever it is. Yeah. And the only way that exists here is industrial alloys. Apparently.\n\nThere must No, there are, there are, there are definitely comets that and asteroids that are made primarily of nickel. Oh, really? Yeah. So the, the, the places where you mine nickel on earth is actually where there was an asteroid or comet that hit earth that was in nickel rich, you know, as Oh, wow. Nick Nickel rich.\n\nRight. Oh, giant nickel Rich, rich deposit.\n\nYeah. That's the, that's, that's, it's coming. Those are from impacts. You definitely didn't wanna be there at the time because anything would've been obliterated. Right. But that's, that's where the, the sources of nickel and cobalt are these days.\n\nSo this is avio a few hours ago, the first hint of non gravitational acceleration that something other than gravity is affecting its acceleration. Meaning something is affecting its trajectory beyond gravity was indicated. Interesting. Dun dun. So it's mostly nickel, very little iron, which he was saying is on earth only exists in alloys, but whatever, you know, you're dealing with another planet. There's,\n\nThere's, there are, there are ca there are cases where there's very nickel rich asteroid meter. Right. That, that, that's, that happened\n\nFor something from space.\n\nYeah. This, it's something. Yeah. Yeah. It doesn't mean it's, it be, it'll be very sort of heavy spaceship to be make it all out of nickel. Oh yeah.\n\nAnd fucking huge, the size of Manhattan and all nickel. That's kind of nuts. Yeah.\n\nThat's a heavy spaceship. That's\n\nA real problem. If it hits\n\nYes. No, we would like obliterate a continent type thing. Yeah. Maybe, maybe was,\n\nYeah. Probably kill most of human life, if not all of us.\n\nI haven't, like, depends on what the, the total mass is. But there's, I mean, the thing is like in the fossil record, there are, you know, there's like arguably, arguably five major extinction events, like the biggest one of which is the perine extinction, where almost all life was eliminated that, that actually occurred over several million, several million years. The, there's the Jurassic, I think Jurassic is, I think that one's pretty definitively an asteroid and, but there's, but there's been five major ex extinction events. But, but what they don't count are really the ones that merely take outta continent. So the merely Yeah. 'cause that, that, because those don't really show up on the fossil record, you know? Right. So unless it's enough to cause a, a, you know, mass extinction event throughout earth, it, it doesn't show up on, you know, in a fossil record that's 200 million years old. So the Yeah. But, but there've been, there've been many, many impacts that would've sort of destroyed all life on, you know, a let's say half of North America or something like that. There many such impacts through the course of history.\n\nYeah. And there's nothing we could do about it right now. Yeah.\n\nThere was one that hits, there's a one that hits Siberia and destroyed I think a few hundred square miles.\n\nOh, that's the tunguska. Yeah, yeah, yeah. That's the one from the 1920s. Right? Yeah. Yeah. That's the one that coincides with that meteor, that comets storm that we go through every June and every November that they think is responsible for that younger driest impact. Yeah. Yeah. All that shit's crazy. Thank you. Before we go any further for letting us have a tour, SpaceX, you're welcome. And letting us be there for the rock and launch. Sure. One of the absolute coolest things I've ever seen in my life. And we, we've, we were, we thought it was only like, I thought it was a half a mile. Jamie's like it was a mile away. Turned out it's almost two miles away. Yeah. Yeah. And you feel it in your chest. Yeah.\n\nIt's, you\n\nHave to wear ear plugs\n\nVery\n\nIntense. And you feel it in your chest and it's two miles away. Yeah. It was fucking amazing. Yeah. And then to go with you up into the command center and to watch all the starlink satellites with all the different cameras and all in real time. Yeah. As it made its way all the way to Australia. How many minutes? Like 35, 40 minutes. Yeah. Wild. Watch it touchdown in Australia. Yeah. Fucking crazy. It was crazy. It amazing. Yeah. Yeah. Absolutely amazing. The\n\nStart's awesome. And anyone can go watch the launch actually. So you can just go to South Padre Island and get as a great view of the launch. So it's like where a lot of spring breakers go. Mm. But, but we'll, we're flying pretty frequently out of star base in South Texas and we, we, we formally incorporated it as a city. So it's, yeah. It's actually a, a legally a a an actual legal city star v Texas. It's not that often you hear like, Hey, we made a city, you know, that used to be like the, like in, in the old days, like a startup would be, you go and gather a bunch of people and say, Hey, let's go make a town, literally. Right. That was like, that would've been startups in in in in the old days.\n\nOr a country. Yeah.\n\nOr a country. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Actually,\n\nIf you tried doing that today, there'd be a real problem.\n\nYeah. Like, maybe think's so much, so much set in stone on the country front, these things, you might be able to pull\n\nIt off. You might be able to pull it off. If you got a, a solid island, you might be able to pull it off. You know, I think it's\n\nProbably,\n\nYou know, like, like at Larry, like make a new country lan country. Yeah. You could probably, is this it right here?\n\nYou could put, if you put enough effort into it, you could make a new country.\n\nThis is one of the different ones. This is the one of the ones that you catch, right? Or is that one? Yeah, that, that's\n\nThe booster. So that's the super heavy booster. So that's one with the booster's got 33 engines that, that in. It's, you know, by version four that will have about 10,000 tons of thrust. You know, right now it's about seven, 8,000 tons of thrust. But it's, that's the largest flying object ever made.\n\nI had to explain to someone, they were going, why do they blow up all the time if he's so smart? 'cause there was this, there was this fucking idiot on television. Some guy was being interviewed and they were talking about you. And he goes, oh, I think he's a fuck wit. And he goes, he's a fuck wit. And he goes, why he say his fuck. Oh, his rockets keep blowing up. And someone said, yeah, well why do his rockets? But, and I had to explain. Yeah, because it's the only way you find out what the tolerances are. You have to Yes. You have to, a few have to\n\nGrow up to corner the box. So, so like, so when you do a new rock development program, you, you, you have to do what's called, you know, exploring the limits, the corners of the box where you say it's like you worst case, this worst case that, to figure out where, where the limits are. So you, you blow up, you know, not, not, not admittedly in the development process sometimes blows up accidentally, but, but we intentionally subjected to, you know, a, a flight regime that is much worse than what we expect in normal flights so that when we put people on board or valuable cargo, it doesn't blow up. So, so, so for example, for the, the flight that you saw, we, we actually deliberately took Heatshield tiles off the, the, the ship, the star off of star ship in, in some of the worst locations to say, okay, if we lose a, a heat shield tile here, is it, is it catastrophic or is it not? And we, we nonetheless star ship was able to do a soft landing in, in the Indian ocean just west of Australia, which is, and, and it got there from Texas in like, I don't know, 35, 40 minutes type of thing. So,\n\nSo it landed, even though you put it through this situation where Yeah, it has compromised shields.\n\nIt, it, it had an, an, an unusually we, we, we, we brought it in hot, like an, an extra hot trajectory with missing tiles to see if it would still make it to a soft landing, which it did. Now, I, I should point out it did have, there were some holes that were burnt into it, but it's, it was robust enough to land despite having some holes burnt. You know, that, that Yeah. Because it's coming, it's coming in like a blazing meteor. Yeah. You can see, you can see the real time video.\n\nWell, tell me the speed again because the, the speed was bananas you were talking about. Yeah,\n\nIt's like 17,000 miles an hour, which is, or like, well call like, like 25 times the speed of sound or thereabouts. So the, so, so think about like, it's, it's like 12 times faster than a bullet from a soul rifle. You know, a bullet from a solf rifle is round mock two and it's\n\nJust, and it's huge. Yeah.\n\nYeah. Or, or if you compare it to like a, a bullet from a, you know, a a 45 or or nine mil, which is subsonic that's, you know, it, it'll be about 30 times faster than a bullet from a handgun.\n\n30 times faster than a bullet from a handgun. And it's the size of a skyscraper.\n\nYes. Yeah. That's fast.\n\nIt's so wild. It's so wild to see, man, it, it's, it's so exciting. The, the factory is so exciting too because like genuinely no bullshit. I felt like I was witnessing history. I felt like it was a scene in a movie, right. Where someone had expectations and they like, what are they doing? They're building rockets and you go there. Yeah. And as we were walking through, Jamie, you could talk, speak to this too. Didn't you have the feeling where you're like, oh, this is way bigger than I thought it was. This is\n\nHuge. It's awesome. That's\n\nGigantic. It's fucking crazy. That's\n\nWhat she said. The\n\nAh, the amount of rockets you're making. But I don't know if 10, 10\n\nBack\n\nGig and Chad in the\n\nHouse, this is way,\n\nIt's a giant metal dick. You're fucking, fucking the universe with your giant metal dick. That's\n\nWhat it's, yeah. I mean, but\n\nIt's,\n\nYeah, it is, it is very big.\n\nAnd the sheer numbers of them that you guys are making. And then this is a version and you have a new updated version. Yeah. That's coming soon. And what is the difference?\n\nIt's a, it's a, it's a little longer,\n\nMore pointy.\n\nIt's the same amount of pointy, but the, there's, it's, it's got a bit more length. The, the in stage, you see that, that inner stage section with kinda like the grill area that's, that's now integrated with the boost stage. So we, we do what's called hot staging where we light the ship engines while it's still attached to the booster. So the boost, the booster engines are still thrusting. It's still, it's, it's, it know it's still being pushed forward by the booster of the ship. But then we light the ship engines and the ship engines actually pull away from the booster, even though the booster engines are still firing. Whoa. So it's blasting flame through that, that grill section. But we integrate that grill section into the boost stage with the next version of the rocket. And, and next version of the rocket will have the Raptor three engines, which are a huge improvement. You may, you may have seen them in the lobby. Yeah. 'cause we've got like the Raptor one, two, and three. And you can see the dramatic improvement in simplicity. We should probably put a plaque there to also show how much the, we reduce the weight, the cost, and the, and improve the efficiency and the thrust. So the Raptor three has, you know, almost twice the thrust of Raptor, Raptor one.\n\nWow.\n\nSo you see Raptor three, it looks like, it looks like it's got parts missing. Right.\n\nAnd how many of them? It's\n\nVery, very clean.\n\nHow many of them are on the rocket?\n\nThere's 33 on the, on the booster.\n\nWhoa.\n\nAnd, and each of, each raptor engine, each producing twice as much thrust as all four engines on a 7 47.\n\nWow.\n\nSo it, that engine is smaller than a 7 47 engine, but it's producing, you know, you know, almost 10 times the thrust of a 7 47 engine. So extremely high powered weight ratio. And,\n\nAnd so when\n\nThere's 33 of them,\n\nYou, when you, so when you're designing these, you get to Raptor one. Yeah. You see its efficiency. You see where you can improve it. You get to Raptor two. How many, how far can you scale this up with just the same sort of technology with propellant and ignition and engines? Like how much further can you,\n\nI mean, we're, we're pushing the limits of physics here. So, and, and, and really in, in order to, to make a, a fully reusable orbital rocket, which no one has succeeded in doing yet. Including, including us. But, but Starship is the first time that there is a design for a rocket where, where full and rapid reusability is actually possible. So it was not, there's not, there's not even been a design before where it was possible. Certainly not a design that that, that got made any hardware at all. Just, we just, we just live, we live on a planet where the gravity is, is is quite high. Like earth's gravity is quite really quite, quite high. And if, if the gravity was even 10 or 20% higher, we'd be stuck on earth forever. Really? Like we, we, yeah, we could not use, certainly couldn't use conventional rockets. You'd have to like blow yourself off the surface with like a nuclear bomb or something crazy. So on the other hand, if, if earth's gravity was just a little lower, like even 10, 20% lower it, then getting to orbit would be easy. So it's like, it's like, it's like this. If this was a video game, it's set to like maximum difficulty, but not impossible. Okay. So that's, that's where we have here. So it's, it's not as though others have ignored the concept of reusability. They've just concluded that it was too difficult to achieve. And we've been working at, on, on this for a long time at, at SpaceX. And you know, I'm the chief engineer of the company. Although I should say that, that, you know, we've an extremely talented engineering team. I think we've got the best rocket engineering team that has ever been assembled. It's, it's an honor to work with such, such incredible people. So, so, so it's fair to say that, you know, we, we have not yet succeeded in creating, in achieving full reusability, but we at last have a rocket where full reusability is possible. And I think, I think we'll achieve it next year. So that's, that's a really big deal. And the reason, the reason that's such, that's such a big deal is that full reusability drops the cost of access to space by a hundred, maybe even more than a hundred, actually. So it could be like a thousand. The, you can think about like any mode of transport. Like imagine if aircraft were, were not reusable. Like you flew somewhere. You have throw the plane air. Like, like imagine if like the way, the way conventional rockets work is it would be like if you had an airplane and, and, and instead of landing at your destination, you parachute out and the plane crashes somewhere and you landed your de and you and you landed in a parachute at your destination. Now that'll be a very expensive trip. And you, and you'd need another plane to get back. Okay. But that's how the other rockets in the world work. Now, the SpaceX Falcon Rocket is the only one that is, is there's, that's at least mostly reusable. You've seen, you've seen the Falcon Rocket, you know, land. We've now done over 500 landings of the SpaceX rocket. Oh, the Falcon Iron rocket. And, and, and this year, you know, we, we'll deliver probably, I don't know, somewhere between twenty two hundred and twenty five hundred tons to orbit with, with the Falcon nine Falcon Heavy Rockets, north County, anything from Starship. And\n\nThis is mostly starlink?\n\nYes, mostly starlink. But we launched many other, we, we even launched our competitors on competitors to starlink on, on Falcon nine. We charge 'em the same price, pretty fair. But SpaceX this year will deliver roughly 90% of all earth, mass orbit.",

      "transcript_chunk": "heir ideas. Yes. They, especially if they've like publicly stated these things, they've, they get very embarrassed of being foolish.\n\nYeah. People most time they double down and, and\n\nThey find echo chambers.\n\nYeah. Yeah. But, but there's, you, you know, the thing is that like I, you know, I've seen more and more people who were convinced of the sort of woke ideology. See the light? Yeah. So not everyone, but it's more and more are seeing the light. And, and it tends to happen like when, when something happens that really, you know, directly affects you. Right. You know, like there was a friend of mine who was living in, in the San Francisco Bay area, and that tried to trans his, his, his daughter, like to the point where the, the, the school like sent sent the police to his house to take his daughter away from him. Now, now that's gonna radicalize you. Well, that's gonna break, that's gonna shake you outta your belief structure. Now. I know.\n\nSo it was an activist at the school Yeah. That was trying to do this. Yeah.\n\nThe school and the, and the state of California conspired to turn his daughter against him and make her take life altering drugs that would've sterilized her and ir irreversible\n\nAnd how old was she?\n\nI think 14. Something like that. So, and he, he managed to talk the police out of taking his daughter away from him that day. And that, that night he got on a plane to Texas.\n\nWow.\n\nAnd a, you know, a year la after just being in, in a, in a school in like greater Austin area. She, she went, she came, went back to normal meaning like the, it it, it wasn't real.\n\nRight. Well, people are being much more open to that now. I mean, wall Street Journal yesterday had that opinion piece that this whole trans thing, there's a lot of evidence. It's a social contagion. Absolutely. And Colin Wright wrote that and then there he's getting death threats now. Of course. And on Blue sky, there's people talking about it. Yep. Exterminating him. Which is one thing that you are allowed to say on Blue Sky. Apparently you're, you're allowed to say horrible things about people say possibly truthful things about this whole social contagion. 'cause that's what, when you get nine kids that are in a friend group and they all decide to turn trans together. Yeah. Something's wrong. Something's wrong. That's not statistically\n\nLike here's feasible. You can convince kids to do anything. You can convince kids to be a suicide bomber. Right.\n\nWhich is why they do with, in, in some countries why they choose children to do that. Yes.\n\nYou can train kids to be suicide bombers and if you can train kids to be suicide bombers, you could convince him of anything.\n\nYeah. Especially with enough positive enforcement Yeah. And cultural enforcement. And you, and, and the idea that, that that's not the case.\n\nThe kids, kids are, kids are malleable. Yeah. The, the minds of youth are easily corrupted. You're\n\nAlso seeing a lot of pushback from gay and lesbian people that are saying like, Hey, if someone did\n\nThis, so stop including me. So Yeah, exactly. Yeah. The L-G-B-T-Q, you know, it's like, wait a second, why are we being included all the time in this situation? Exactly.\n\nExactly. When, especially when, you know, like my friend Tim Dylan's talked about this, it's like, it's really homophobic because you're taking these gay kids and you're, you're telling them like, Hey, you're not gay. You're actually a girl. Yes. And you know, hey, hey, go make it so that you can never have an orgasm again and you'll be happy. Like Yeah.\n\nIt's fucking crazy. Like permanent permanent mutilation. Permanent castration of, of kids is like, I, I think I we should look at, at anyone who permanently castrates a kid as like right up there with Joseph Maner. Yeah. I mean they're, they're mutilating children.\n\nYeah. Yeah. And it's thought of as being kind and the thing Yeah. Would you rather have a live daughter or a dead son?\n\nThat's that's the, that's the line they use.\n\nYeah. Which is not supported by any data.\n\nNo, it's all bullshit. In fact, the, the probability of suicide increases. Right. Because this is important maybe for the audience to know the probability of suicide increases if you trans a kid not decreases by some accounts it triples. So that, that is an evil lie.\n\nAnd it's a lie that is supposedly compassionate. Imagine you've twisted reality to the point where confusing a child that's not even legally allowed to get a fucking tattoo. Yeah. Right. Because you think that you could make a mistake with a tattoo. Exactly. A totally removable thing. Right. If I wanted to tomorrow I could go to a doctor and they could laser off every tattoo that I have on me. Right. Okay. No harm, no foul. Yeah. But you get sterilized, like that's it. Forever. Forever. Yes. Yes. They'll castrate you. You no longer have testicles. You\n\nHave Yes. That's not coming\n\nBack. Have no penis. You have a hole where your penis used to be. Yes. And this is compassionate and this is preventing\n\nYou from, and actually a lot of kids die in, in, in with the, these sex change operations. They die. The, the number of deaths on the operating table. People don't hear about this a lot of the kids because that we, it, it's, we don't really actually have the technology to make this work. So a bunch of the times the kids just die in this exchange operations\n\nJesus\n\nChrist. Yeah. It's, it's demented. Which it should be viewed as like, you know, like, like evil Nazi doctor stuff, basically.\n\nWell, that's why it's,\n\nIt was so like real Nazi, not the bullshit fake Nazi stuff.\n\nCrazy that even pushing back against something that seems like fundamentally logically very easy to argue, the old Twitter would ban you forever.\n\nYes.\n\nThat's how crazy a social contagion can get when it completely defies logic victimizes children. Yeah. Does something that makes no sense, does not supported by data all connected to this ideology that trans is good. We gotta save trans kids. Protect trans kids.\n\nYeah. And what I want to emphasize is that the, the save trans kids thing is a lie. If if if you, if you, if you castrate kids and trans them, the probability of suicide increases, it does not decrease. It substantially increases the, the, the, the studies have done that. I've seen that the risk of suicide triples if you trans kids. So you're not saving them, you're killing them. Moreover, during the sex change operation, there are many deaths that occur during the sex change operation.\n\nJesus Christ. It's just crazy that this is a real issue.\n\nYeah. It it's a nightmare fever dream. And, and people are finally waking up from it.\n\nNow, when you started getting into the Doge stuff and started finding how much money is being shuffled around and moved around to NGOs and how much money is involved and just totally untraceable funds, like this is again, something like two years plus ago. You weren't aware of it all?\n\nNo, I was aware of it. I just didn't realize how, how the, how big it was. It was just, just, just how much waste and forward there is in the government is truly vast. In fact, the government didn't even know, nor did they care.\n\nThat's crazy. Yeah. And I mean,\n\nJust like some of the very basic stuff that Doge did will have lasting effects. And some of these things like they're so elementary, you can't believe it. So the, the Doge team got the, you know, the, the, the mo most of the main payments computers to require the, the congressional appropriation code. So when a payment is made, you have to actually enter the congressional appropriation code that used to be optional and, and often would be just left blank. So the money would just go out. But it wasn't even tied to a, a congressional appropriation. Then they also, doge team also made the comment field for the payment mandatory. So you have to say something we're, we're not saying that what, what is said, like you can say anything. You, you, you could, your cat could run across the keyboard. You could go query A SDF, but you have to say something above nothing. Because what we found was that there were tens of billions, maybe hundreds of billions of dollars. There were zombie payments. So there, like somebody had approved a payment, something the government approved a payment and some recurring payment and they retired or died or changed jobs and no one turned the money off. So the money would just keep going out. And, and it's a pretty rare\n\nAnd go where\n\nTo, to a company or an individual. And it's a pretty rare company or individual who will complain that they're getting money that they should not get. And, and a bunch of the money was just going to the, were transfer payments to the states. So\n\nThese are automatic payments there.\n\nYeah. Just automatic payments.\n\nNo accounting for them at all. Like\n\nImagine like, like there's an automatic debit of your credit card and you don't, you never look at the statement. Right. So it it is just money going out. I call 'em zombie payments that there might have been, there might have been legitimate at one point, but the person who approved that recurring payment changed jobs, died, retired or whatever. And no one ever turned the money off. And my my guess is that's probably at least a hundred billion dollars a year, maybe 200\n\nAnd going where?\n\nTo, to, I mean there, there are millions of these payments. So, so it's, I mean,\n\nMillions.\n\nYes. Yes.\n\nMillions of payments that are going to, who knows where.\n\nYes. So in a bunch of cases, there are fraud rings that operate, professional fraud rings that operate to exploit the system. They figure out some security hole in the system and they just do professional fraud. And, you know, that's where we found, for example, people who were, you know, 300 years old in the Social security administration database.\n\nNow I thought that this was a mistake of not registering their deaths. That people were born like a long time ago and it had defaulted to like a certain number. And so that after time those people were still in the system. It was just an error of the, the way the accounting was done.\n\nYeah. So that's not true. So there's, or or at least one of two things must be true. The, there's a, there's a typo or, or some mistake in the computer or it's fraudulent. But we don't have any 300 year old vampires living in America. Allegedly. Allegedly. And, or, or, and we don't have people in some cases who, who are receiving payments who are born in the future. Born in the future. Born in the future. Really? Yes. There were, there, there the people receiving payments whose birth date was like in 2100 and something. Okay. So there's\n\nThere like\n\nNext century is\n\nThere a task course?\n\nSo we know, we know that one of two things must be true. That, that there, that either there's a mistake in the computer or it's fraud, but if you have someone's birth date that's either in the future or where they're older than the oldest living American. 'cause the oldest living American is 114 years old. So if they're more than 114 years old, there was either a mistake and someone should, should call them and say, I I think we have your birthday wrong. Because it says you were born in 17, you know, eighty, eighty six. And you know, that was before, you know, you know, before there was really in America, you know, it was like, it was like, you know, it's kind of early, you know, we're still fighting England type of thing. You know, it's like this person either needs to be the Guinness Book or World Records or, or they're not alive. But still\n\nAt the end of the day, money is going towards that account that's connected to this person that is either non-existent or\n\nDead. So like yeah, so there was like, I think something like on a 20 million people in the Social Security administration database that could not possibly be alive if their birthdate is like, based on their birthdate, they could not possibly be alive.\n\nAnd then to be clear, 20 million people that were receiving funds,\n\nA bunch of, most of them were not receiving funds. Some of them were receiving funds. Most were not receiving funds. But, so lemme tell you how the scam works. It's, it's a bank shot. So the Social Security administration database is used as the source of truth by all the other databases that the government uses. So even if they stop the payments on the Social Security administration database like unemployment insurance, small business administration, student loans, all check the Social security administration database to say, is this, is this a a legitimate alive person? And and if the social security database will say, yes, this person is still alive, even though they're 200 years old, but forget to mention that they're 200 years old, it just says, it just returns when, when the computer is queried, it says, yes, this person is live. And so then they're able to exploit the entire rest of the government ecosystem. So fake. Then you get fake student loans, then you get fake unemployment insurance, then you get like fake medical payments. And\n\nThis doesn't have to be tied to an individual where, where there's an address we can check on this person.\n\nNo, if you did do, if you just did any check at all, you would stop this. So, so, so that's that, that, that's so, so,\n\nAnd how much money do you think is made\n\nAny check, like anything at all the, the then that would start would stop the fraud? Like any effort at all. Yeah.\n\nSo there's multiple layers. Yeah. The social security number verifies that this is a real person. Right. And then the other system check up on\n\nCan exploit every other government payment and, and every other government payment system for everything. For, like I said, small, small business administration, student loans, Medicaid, Medicare, every other government payment of which there are many, there are, there are actually hundreds of government payment systems can all be exploited so long as social security database says this person is alive. That's the nature of the scam. It's a bank shot. So then the, then the rebuttal from the Dems is like, oh, well the vast majority of the people who are marked as live in the Social Security Administration weren't receiving Social Security administration payments. That is true. What they forgot to mention is they're getting fraudulent payments from every other government program. And that's why the, the, the dams were so opposed to turning off to, to declaring someone dead who was dead because it would stop the entire other, all the other fraud from happening.\n\nAnd so, but all this, is it trackable, like all this other fraud? It's tryable if they wanted to, they could chase it all down. Yeah.\n\nIt's not even hard.\n\nAnd yet they're opposing cha cha chasing it all down.\n\nThey're opposing chasing it all down because it would, it turns off the money magnet for the illegals.\n\nWow.\n\nBecause it's very logical to, to like, like I'm saying, the most common sense things possible. If someone's got a birthday in social security, that is an impossible birthday, meaning they are older than the oldest living American or born in the future, then you should call them and say, excuse me, we seem to have your birthday wrong because it says that you're 200 years old. That's all you need to do. And, and then\n\nYou would remove them from the social security database and make that number no longer available for all those other government payments. Exactly.\n\nWow.\n\nAnd how much money are we talking?\n\nIt's a hundred hundreds of billions of dollars.\n\nAnd this is all traceable. Like you could hunt all this down.\n\nWhat is like, you don't need to be Sherlock Holmes here is what I'm saying.\n\nWell, this\n\nIs, we, we don't need to call Sherlock Holmes for this one. Is this part of this? We just need to call the person is this and, and, and say, excuse me. We either ha we, we seem to have the, like we, we, we must have your birthday wrong because it says you're 200 years old or we're born in the future.",

      "transcript_chunk": "birthday in social security, that is an impossible birthday, meaning they are older than the oldest living American or born in the future, then you should call them and say, excuse me, we seem to have your birthday wrong because it says that you're 200 years old. That's all you need to do. And, and then\n\nYou would remove them from the social security database and make that number no longer available for all those other government payments. Exactly.\n\nWow.\n\nAnd how much money are we talking?\n\nIt's a hundred hundreds of billions of dollars.\n\nAnd this is all traceable. Like you could hunt all this down.\n\nWhat is like, you don't need to be Sherlock Holmes here is what I'm saying.\n\nWell, this\n\nIs, we, we don't need to call Sherlock Holmes for this one. Is this part of this? We just need to call the person is this and, and, and say, excuse me. We either ha we, we seem to have the, like we, we, we must have your birthday wrong because it says you're 200 years old or we're born in the future. So could you tell us what your birthday is? That's what we need to do. It says that simple.\n\nBut the, all these other government payments that are available that are connected to this social security number, it seems like if you just chased that all down Yeah. You would find the widespread fraud you would find where it's going.\n\nYes. The the but the, the root of the problem is the social security Right. Administration database. Because the social security number in the United States is used as a defacto national ID number. You know, that's why like the bank always asks for your social, right. So like the, you know, any financial institution will ask for your social security number.\n\nThis is, it sounds so insane that this isn't chased down. I mean, like I agree that, I mean, I mean that in and of itself is, that's such mishandling.\n\nYes.\n\nNo, it's my, it's mind blowing. So Yeah. It's crazy.\n\nWell, you were very reluctant last time you were here to talk about the extent of some of the fraud. 'cause you're like, they could kill me because this is kind of, oh,\n\nWhat, yeah, what I was saying is that the, like if you create, if like I, I like, like to be pragmatic and realistic, you actually can't manage to zero fraud. You, you can manage to low fraud number, but not to zero fraud. If you manage to zero fraud, you, you, you're gonna push so many people over the edge who are receiving fraudulent payments that the number of inbound homicidal maniacs will be really hard to overcome. So I I'm, I'm, I'm actually taking I think, quite a reasonable position, which is that we should simply reduce the amount of fraud, which I think is not an extremist position and we should aspire to, you know, have less fraud over time. Not that we should be altered the draconian and eliminate every last scrap of fraud, which I guess would be nice to have. But, but like, we don't even need to go that extreme. I'm, I'm saying we should just stop the latent large scale super obvious fraud. I think that's a reasonable position. It's\n\nA very reasonable position. Yeah. And so what was the most shocking pushback that you got when you started implementing Doge, when you started investigating into where money was going?\n\nWell, I guess it, this was, I should have anticipated this, but while most of the fraudulent government payments to, especially to the NGOs go to the Democrats, most of it like, I don't know for argument's sake, let's say 80%, not maybe 90%, 10 to 20% of it does go to Republicans. And so when turn off funding to a fraudulent NGO would get complaints from whatever the 10% of Republicans who were receiving the money and, and they would, you know, they would very loudly complain because they're the, the, the honest answer is the Republicans are, are partly they're receiving some of the fraud too. They're getting a vig\n\nJesus.\n\nYeah. It's, it's, I wanna be clear, it's, it's not like the Republican party is some no ultrapure paragon of virtue here. No. Okay. Well\n\nYou see that with the Congressional insider training. It's across the board.\n\nYeah.\n\nIt's left and right.\n\nI mean, the whole uni party criticism has some validity to it. You know, there's so, and it's, it's like if you turn off fraudulent payments, it's not like, like I said, it's not like 100% of those payments were going to, to Democrats a, a small percentage were go also going to Republicans. Those republicans complain very loudly. And you know, and, and that's, that's, so they, there there was a lot of pushback on the Republican side for when we started cutting some of these, these funds. And I tried telling 'em like, well, you know, 90% of the money is going to your opponents, but they still, if they, even if they're getting 10% of money, they want their\n\nPeace.\n\nYeah. They want their peace.\n\nAnd they've been getting that piece for a long time. Yes. Did you\n\nThink this is why like, you know, politics is like\n\nIt's dirty business?\n\nYeah, I mean that's like saying if like, you know, if, if you, if you like sausages and respect the Lord, do not watch either of them being, being made.\n\nYeah,\n\nYeah,\n\nYeah. Wow.\n\nWell that's not even true because I've made sausage before.\n\nYeah, yeah. It's\n\nActually, yeah, it's like, it's not that big a deal. Yeah. Fat and spices and casing run it through the machine. Not that big a deal.\n\nYeah. But yeah, I mean I I I think the stuff I'm saying here is not like, like if you, if you stand back and think about it for a second, like, oh yeah, that, that makes sense. You know? Yeah. The, it, it's, it's not like it, it's not like one political party's gonna be, you know, pure devil or pure angel. There, there's, you know, I think there's, there's, there's, there's much more corruption on the Democrat side, but it's not, there's not, there's still some corruption on the Republican side. How\n\nDid it happen that the majority of the corruption wound up being on the Democrat side?\n\nWell, because the, the, the, the transfer payments, especially to illegals are very much on the Democrat side. That,\n\nSo that's the root of it all is the illegal situation.\n\nYes. I mean there's, or\n\nA focal\n\nPoint. Yes. It, it's also like, it's, it's, it's, it would also be accurate to say that while o obviously not everyone who is a Democrat is a criminal, almost everyone who is a criminal is a Democrat because, because the Democrats are the soft on crime party. So if you're a criminal, who are you gonna vote for?\n\nRight?\n\nRight. The soft on crime party,\n\nDid you think you were going to be able to get more done than you were?\n\nWe did get a lot done. Right. And Doge is still, still still happening by the way, the, this, the, the doge is still underway. There are still, there are still, there's still waste and fraud being, being cut by by the Doge team. So it hasn't stopped the, it's less\n\nPublicized.\n\nIt's less publicized. And they don't have like a clear person to attack anymore.\n\nWell, it seems like once you stepped\n\nAway, they're, they're, they're basically, they, they, they applied immense pressure to me to just, to stop it. So then I'm like, the best thing for me is to just, you know, cut outta this. And in any case, as a special governor employee, I could only be there for like 120 days anyway. Something like that. So whatever the law says, so I, I could, I I I was necessarily could only be there for four months as a special government employee. So, but yeah, I mean, I mean, you turn off the money spigot to, to fraudsters, they get very upset to say the least. And, but my, like, my death threat level went ballistic, you know, it was like a, like a rocket going orbit. Yeah. So, but now that, now, now that I'm not in DC that, that, that I, that I guess they don't really have a person to attack anymore. Well,\n\nThe rhetoric about you has calmed down Si significantly.\n\nYeah.\n\nIt was disturbing. It was disturbing to watch. It was like, this is crazy. Yeah. And to watch these politicians engage in it and all these people just like framing you, it was this monster. I was like, this is so weird. Like, this is what happens when you uncover fraud. Yes. The whole machine turns on you. Yeah. And if it wasn't for a person like you who owns a platform and has an enormous amount of money, like it could have destroyed you.\n\nYeah.\n\nAnd that was the goal.\n\nThe goal was to destroy me. Absolutely. Because\n\nYou were getting in the way Yeah. Of this amazing graft. The,\n\nThe, the this gigantic fraud machine. Yeah. Like I said, I think we, we've, we've, I think those teams Aren done a lot of good work, you know, in in, in terms of fraud and waste prevented, my guess is it's, you know, probably on the order of two or 300 billion a year. So it's pretty good.\n\nWhat do you think could have been done if you just had like full reign and total cooperation? How much do you think you could have saved?\n\nI mean, what level of p of power are we assuming here? God-like, oh yeah, I could probably cut the federal budget in half and get more done.\n\nThat is so crazy. It is so crazy that it, it's\n\nThat, yeah. Get more done and federal vision half widespread,\n\nIt's that widespread.\n\nWell, I mean, a whole bunch of government departments simply shouldn't exist in my opinion. They, they, they, you know,\n\nLike examples,\n\nWell, the Department of Ed, department of Education, which was created recently, like under Jimmy Carter, the, our education results have gone downhill ever since it was created. So if you, if you create a department and the result of creating that department is a massive decline in educational results and it's department of education, you're better off not having it because we're literally, we, we were did better before there was one than after\n\nWhen you let the states run it. Yes. Yeah. Because\n\nAt least the states can compete with one another. So, but the problem is like here, like cutting department, educational, our kids need education. Yeah, they do. But, but this is a new department that didn't even exist, you know, until late, the late seventies. And ever since that department was created, the results, educational results have declined. And so why would you ha have an institution continue that has made education worse? It doesn't make sense. They\n\nKilled it though, right? No,\n\nThere still is, unfortunately.\n\nBut they were trying to kill it.\n\nIt has been substantially reduced.\n\nOkay.\n\nWhat\n\nOther organizations, what other departments? Well,\n\nI mean, I'm a small government guy, so, you know, when, when the, you know, when the country was created, we just, we, we just had the department of state, department of War, you know, and, and sort of the, sort of the Department of Justice. We had an attorney general and treasury department. I don't know why you need more than that.\n\nI, so what are the departments specifically do you think are just completely ineffective?\n\nWell, I mean, here it's like a question, it's a sort of philosophical question of how much government do you think there should be?\n\nRight.\n\nIn, in my opinion, there should be the least amount of government. I've\n\nHeard the most bizarre argument against this is that you're cutting jobs and you're gonna leave people jobless. And I'm like, but their jobs are useless.\n\nDetrimental. Yeah. Paying people, detrimental people to do nothing doesn't make sense. Right. Like there's a, like a, a a great, I this is a story about like Milton Friedman who's awesome, what, like, generally whatever Milton Friedman said is, you know, people should, should do that thing. I'm not sure if it's apocryphal or not, but like, like someone complained to him, like, or he, he, he observed I think people that were like digging ditches with, you know, with, with shovels. And, and he said, well, like allegedly Freeman said, well I think I think you should use, you know, excavating equipment instead of shovels and you could get it done with far fewer people. And then, and then someone said, but then we're gonna lose a lot of jobs. Well, in that then freedom was says, well, in that case, why don't you have 'em use teaspoons?\n\nJust,\n\nJust dig ditches with teaspoons. Think of all the jobs you'll create. I, I mean It's bullshit basically you just want people to work on, on things that are, that are productive. You want people to work on, on building things, on building, you know, providing products and services that people find valuable. Like, you know, making food, being, you know, being a farmer or a plumber or electrician or just anyone who's a builder or providing useful services. And that's what you want people to be doing. Not fake government jobs that, that, that don't add any value or may subtract value. Well there's also like, you know, to illustrate the absurdity of also how is the eco, how is the economy measured? Like the, the way economists measure the economy is, is is nonsensical because they'll measure any job, no matter, even if that job is a dumb job that has no point and is even counterproductive. So like, so like, like the, the joke is like, there's two economists going on a hike in the woods and they come across a a pile of she and one economist says the other, I'll pay you a hundred dollars to eat, eat that shit.\n\nAn\n\nEconomist eats the shit, gets the a hundred dollars, they, they keep walking. Then the other econom, then they come across another pile of shit. And, and the, the other economist says, now I'll pay you a hundred dollars to eat the pile of shit. So pays the, so pays the other economist a hundred dollars a pile of shit. Then they, then, then, then the way said, they said, well wait a second, we both just ate a pile of shit and we are no, and, and, and, and we're, we're, no, we, we, we, we, we, we don't have any more extra money. Like, like we both just gave the a hundred dollars back to me and we both ate a pile of shit. This doesn't make any sense. And they said, no, no, but think of the economy. 'cause that's $200 of, of in the economy that, that, that, that basically then measure eating, eating shit would count as a as as a, as a job.\n\nThis\n\nIs, this is, this is to illustrate the absurdity of of, of e of economics.\n\nOne of the things you said when you\n\nEating\n\nKnocked away, when you down as a\n\nJob, one of the things you said when you stepped away is that you're kind of done and that it's unfixable that\n\nWell\n\nOr under its current form, the way people are approaching it,\n\nYou, you, you can, you can make it directionally better, but ultimately you can't fully fix the system. So I I I like, like, like, like it, it it is, it is, it would be accurate to say that even like, unless you could go like super draconian like, you know, Genghis Kahn level on, on, on cutting waste at waste and fraud, which you can't really do in a democratic country, an aspirationally democratic country, then there's no way to solve the, the, the debt crisis. So we've got, we've got national debt that's just insane where the debt payments, the interest payments and the debt exceed our entire military budget. I mean that's one, that was one of the wake up calls for me. I was like, wait a second. The interest on a national debt is bigger than the entire, the entire military budget and growing this is crazy. So, so, so even if you implement all these savings, you're only delaying the day of reckoning for when America becomes, goes bankrupt. So unless you go full gangs con, which you can't really do. So, So I came to the conclusion that the only way that the only way to get us out of the debt crisis and to prevent America from going bankrupt is AI and robotics. So like we need to grow the economy at, at a, at a, at a rate that allows us to, to pay off our debt. And I I I, I guess people just generally don't appreciate the degree to which, you know, this, the, the, the government overspending is, is a problem. But even like the social security website, this is under the Biden administration on the website, it would say like we, based on, on current demographic trends and you know, and, and, and how much money social security is bringing in versus how many social security recipients there are.",

      "transcript_chunk": "work and\n\nPurpose. Purpose for things that you, you know, find things that you do that you enjoy. But there's a lot of people that are independently wealthy that spend most of their time doing something they enjoy. Right. And that could be the majority of people,\n\nPretty much everyone.\n\nBut we'd have to rewire how people approach life, which seems to be like acceptable because you're not asking them to be enslaved. You're exactly a asking them the opposite. Like, no longer be burdened by financial worries, now go do what you like.\n\nYes.\n\nGo fucking test pizza. Do whatever you want.\n\nYes. Pretty much. So that's, that's, that's the, that's the, that's probably the best case outcome.\n\nThat sounds like the best case outcome period for the future. If you're looking at like how much people have struggled just to feed themselves all throughout history, food, shelter, safety, if all that stuff can be fair, like how much would you solve a lot of the crime if there was a universal high income? Just think of that. Like how much of crime is financially motivated, you know, the greater percentage of people that are committing crimes live in poor disenfranchised neighborhoods. So if there's no such thing anymore, if you really can achieve universal high income Yeah. That this is, it sounds like a utopian\n\nYes. I think some people may commit crime because they like committing crime just Oh sure. Some amount, some amount of that is they just destroy\n\nWhile people out there.\n\nYeah. Yeah.\n\nAnd obviously they've become 40 years old living a life like that. Now all of a sudden universal high income is not gonna completely stop their instincts.\n\nYeah. I mean, I guess if you want to have like, like say read a science fiction book or some books that, that are probably inaccurate or, or the, the least inaccurate version of the future, I'd say I'd, I'd recommend the Ian Banks books called the, the, the culture books. It's not actually a series. It's a, it's like a s sci-fi books about the future. They're generally called the Culture books, Ian Banks culture books. It's worth reading those. When\n\nDid he write these?\n\nHe started writing them in the seventies, and I think he, the last one, I think he was, I think it was written just like around, I dunno, maybe 2010 or something. I'm not sure exactly.\n\nI\n\nYeah, yeah.\n\nScottish author Ian Banks. Yeah. From 87 to 2012. Yeah. Interesting.\n\nBut he, but like, he wrote the, the, the, like his first book Consider Fleas. I think he started writing that in the seventies.\n\nI, and,\n\nBut these books are incredible by the way. Oh, incredible books.\n\n4.6 stars on Amazon. Interesting.\n\nSo,\n\nSo this gives me hope.\n\nYeah, yeah, yeah. This\n\nIs the first time I've ever thought about it this way.\n\nYeah. Well, I mean, if, like, I'll often ask people what is the future that you want? And they have to think about it for a second. 'cause you know, they were usually tied up in whatever their daily struggles are. But, but you say, what is the future that you want? And, and generally sustainable abundance, or at least folks say, what about a future where there's sustainable abundance? Like, oh yeah, that's a pretty good future. So, you know, if, if, and that, that future is attainable with AI and robotics. But, but you know, it's, it's like I said, there's not every path is a good path. There's this, it's, but I think if we, if we push it in the direction of maximally truth seeking and curious, then I think AI will want to take to, to take care of humanity and foster foster humanity because we're interesting. And if it hasn't been programmed to think that like all straight white males should die, which Gemini was basically programmed to do at at least first, you know, they seemed to have fixed it, hopefully fixed it. But\n\nDon't you think culturally like, oh, we're getting away from that mindset and that people realize,\n\nYeah, I think\n\nWe're getting away from how preposterous that all is.\n\nWe we're getting away from it. So we are getting at, at least it knows, the AI mostly knows to hide things. But like, like I said, there is that I, I think I still have that as, or I had that as my like pin pinned post on X, which was like, Hey, wait a second guys, we still have every ai except Roc is saying that basically straight white males should die and this is a problem and we should fix it. You know, but simply me saying that is like tends to generally result in, you know, them like, Ooh, that is kind of bad. Maybe we should just, we should not have all straight white males die. I think they have say also all, all, all straight Asian males should also die as well. They like, they don't like, like generally, generally the AI and the, and the media, you know, which, which ba back in the day, the AI and the, the, the media wa was, you know, racist against black people and sexist against women back in the day. Now, now it is racist against white people and Asians and ra and sexist against men. So, and over they're just like being racist and sexist. I think they just want to change the target. So, but, but really they just shouldn't be racist and sexist at all, you know, obviously.\n\nYeah. Ideally that would be nice.\n\nThat would be nice.\n\nAnd it's kind of crazy that we were kind of moving in that general direction till around 2012 and then everything ramped up online and, and everybody was accused of being a Nazi and everybody was transphobic and racist and sexist and homophobic and everything got exaggerated to the point where it was this wild witch hunt where everyone was a colombo looking for racism.\n\nYeah, yeah, yeah. Totally. Well, well, but, but, but they, they were openly anti-white and often openly anti-Asian.\n\nAnd then this new sentiment that you cannot be racist against white people. 'cause racism is power and influence and Okay, no it's not.\n\nYeah. Racism is, is is racism in the absolute. So, you know, and, and there just needs to be consistency. So if it's okay to have, let's say black or Asian or Indian or pride, it should be okay to have white pride too. Yeah. So that's just a con, that's just a consistency question. So, you know, if it, if it's okay to be proud of one religion, it should be okay to be proud of I I guess all religions provided there that, that they're, they're not like\n\nOppressive.\n\nYeah. Or, or, or don't, like, as long as part of that religion is not like exterminating people who are not in that religion type of thing.\n\nRight.\n\nSo it's really just like a consistency bias or, or just like ensuring consistency to eliminate bias. So if it is possible to be racist a against one race, it's possible to racist against any race. So of\n\nCourse, logically yes. Yeah. And arguing against that is, that's when you know you're captured.\n\nIt's, it's, it's a, it's a logical inconsistency Yeah. That makes AI go insane.\n\nAnd people,\n\nAnd people go insane. Yes. What more, but like the, the like, like you can't simultaneously say that the, the the systemic racist oppression, but also that racists don't exist. That that that race ra race is a social construct. Like which is it, you know, you also can say that, you know, anyone who steps foot in America is is automatically an American except for the, the people that originally came here.\n\nExactly. Exactly. Except for the colonizers.\n\nYeah. Except for the evil colonizers who came here. Right. So which one is it like, right. If, if you step as if as soon as you step foot in a place you are, that you are just as American as everyone else, then that would've applied. If you apply that consistently, then the original white settlers were also just as American as everyone else.\n\nYeah.\n\nLogically, logically.\n\nOne more thing that I have to talk to you about before you leave is the rescuing of the people from the space station, which we talked about. You were planning it the last time you were here. The fact the the lack of coverage that that got in mainstream media was one of the most shocking things that they\n\nSeen. Yeah. They totally memory hold that thing\n\nWild. Yes.\n\nBecause if it, it\n\nWasn't\n\nYou, it's like, it's like it didn't exist.\n\nThose people would be dead. They'd be stuck up there.\n\nWell, they'd, they'd probably still be alive, but they'd, they'd, they'd, they'd be having bone density issues because of prolonged exposure to zero gravity. Well, they\n\nWere already up there for like eight months. Right. Yeah. Which is an insanely long time. It takes forever to recover just from that.\n\nYeah. They're only supposed to be at the Space station for three to six months maximum. So\n\nOne of the things that you told me that was so crazy was that you could have gotten them sooner, but\n\nYeah. But for political reasons they didn't. They, they did not want SpaceX or me to be associated with returning the astronauts before the election.\n\nThat is so wild that that's a fact. Oh yeah. First of all, that even\n\nWe, we absolutely could have done it. So,\n\nBut even though you did do it and you did it after the election, it received almost no media coverage anyway.\n\nYes. Because nothing good con the, the, the media, which is essentially a far of pro the legacy mainstream media is a far left propaganda machine. And so anything, any story that is positive about someone who is not a part of the sort of far left tribe will not get any coverage. So I I I could save a busload of orphans and, and it, it wouldn't get a single news story.\n\nIt's, it really is nuts. It it was nuts to watch because even though it was discussed on podcasts and it was discussed on X and it was discussed on social media, it still, it was a blip in the news cycle. It was very quick. Yeah. It was in and out and because it was a successful launch and you did rescue those people, nobody got hurt. And there was nothing really to, there was no blood to talk about. Right. Just fucking in and out,\n\nGone. Yeah. Yeah, absolutely. Well, and, and as, as you saw firsthand with the Starship launch, like Starship is, you know, by, you know, at least by some, some would consider it to be like the most amazing, you know, engineering project that's happening on earth right now, outside of like, you know, maybe AI or AI and robotics. But, but certainly in terms of a spectacle to see it is the most spectacular thing that is happening on earth right now is, is the Starship launch program, which anyone can go and see if they just go to South Texas and just they can just run a hotel room, low cost in South Padre Island or in Brownsville, and you can see the launch and, and you can drive Right, right past the factory. 'cause it's on a public highway, but it gets no coverage or, or what coverage does get was like a rocket blew up\n\nCoverage, so, right. Yeah. Oh, he's a fuck with the rocket blew up.\n\nYeah. The, the, like, the, the, the, the Sasha program is vastly, vastly more capable than the entire Apollo Moon, moon program. Vastly more capable. Th th this is a spaceship that is designed to make life multi-planetary, to carry millions of people across the heavens to another planet. The, the Apollo program could, could only send astronauts to the moon for a few hours at a time. Like they could send two, the entire Apollo program could only send astronauts to visit the moon very briefly, and then for a few hours, and then depart the Starship program could create an entire Luna base with a million people. You understand the mag the magnitudes are different, very different magnitudes here.\n\nSo what, what was the political\n\nResistance? But there's basically no, no coverage of it.\n\nYeah. But what I wanted to ask you is like, what, so what were the conversations leading up to the rescue? Like when you were like, I can get them out way quicker?\n\nYeah, well, I mean, you know, I raised this a few times, but it was the, I was told instructions came from the White House that, you know, that the, that there should be no attempt to rescue before the election.\n\nThat should be illegal. That, that, that really should be a, a horrendous miscarriage of justice for those poor people that were stuck on that.\n\nYeah. It it is, it is crazy. Have\n\nYou ever talked to those folks afterwards? Did you have conversations with them?\n\nYeah, I mean they, they're, they're not gonna say anything political to be, you know, they're not like, they're never gonna curse. Did\n\nThey at least say Thank you?\n\nYeah, yeah, yeah. Well that's nice. Yeah, yeah. Absolutely. So,\n\nBut the instructions came down from the White House. You cannot rescue them because politically this is a, a bad hand of cards.\n\nI mean, they didn't say because politically it's a bad hand of cards, but they, they just said they weren't, they were not interested in any rescue operation before the election. Yeah. So\n\nWhat did that feel like?\n\nI wasn't surprised,\n\nBut it's crazy.\n\nYeah.\n\nBecause Biden could have authorized it and they could have said the, the Biden administration is helping bring those people back, throw you a little funding, give you some money to do it. The Biden administrator, they funded these people being returned.\n\nYeah. The Biden administration was not exactly my best friend. Thats what I heard. Especially after I, you know, you know, help Trump get elected, get get elected. Which I mean, some people still think, you know, Trump is like the, the devil, basically. And I mean, I think, I think Trump actually, he is, he is not perfect. But, but he's not evil. Trump is not evil. I mean, I spent a lot of time with, with him and he's, I mean, he's a product of his time, but he is not, he's not evil. No,\n\nNo. I don't think he's evil either. But if you look at the media coverage,\n\nThe media, the media's Theresa Nike's super evil. Yeah.\n\nIt's pretty shocking. If you look at the amount of negative coverage, like one of the things that I looked at the other day was mainstream media coverage of you trump a bunch of different Oh yeah. Public figures and then mom,\n\n96% negative or something crazy. Yeah.\n\nAnd then Momani, which is like 95% positive,\n\nRight? I mean, Momani is, is is a charismatic swindler. I I've, I mean, you gotta hand it to him. Like he, he did, he can't light up a stage, but he is just been a swindler his entire life. And, you know, and, and I, I think he, he what? He's, I mean he's likely to win li he's likely to be mayor of New York, New York City.\n\nVery likely.\n\nYeah. Very likely. I think\n\nWhat poll market has it at? What, what is the 94%? 94%?\n\nYeah, that sounds pretty likely. That's crazy. Like, I'm not sure who the 6% are, you know, so, so, so yeah. So that's, well\n\nIt's also like who's on the other side? The fucking guardian angel guy with the Beret and Andrew Cuomo, who doesn't even have a party like the, the Democrats don't even want 'em. So you have those two options and then you have the young kids who are like finally socialism.\n\nYeah. They, they dunno what they're talking about, obviously. So, you know, like you just look at this, say how many boats come from Cuba to Florida and how many, but, and how many boats because you know, there's like a constant, I was thinking like, how many boats are accumulating on the shores of Florida coming from, from Cuba. Right. There's a, there's a whole bunch of free boats that you could, if you want to go take 'em back to Cuba, it's pretty close. Yeah. But for some reason people don't do that. Why? Why, why, why are the boats only coming in this direction? Well, who\n\nIs, who are the most rabid capitalists in America? The fucking Cubans.\n\nAbsolutely.\n\nYeah. They're like, we've seen how this story goes.\n\nWe do not want Exactly. Yeah.\n\nFuck off. They don't Cubans in Miami, they don't want to hear any bullshit. They don't wanna hear any socialism bullshit. They're like, no, no, no. We know what this actually is. This isn't just some fucking dream.\n\nYeah. It's extreme Go oppression. Yeah.\n\nThat's what it\n\nAlways means. It's is a nightmare.",

      "transcript_chunk": "me or whatever, around my friends, I will, I will invite them over or whatever. And I bring in some Jewish friends of mine and other black friends or white friends so that they can see something outside the echo chamber. Another former neo-Nazi, who's a very good friend of mine, was telling me that when he was in,\n\nThat's funny, funny sentence, another moron, right. Former neo-Nazi, who's a very good friend of mine.\n\nA Freudian slip. No,\n\nIt's, it's accurate.\n\nExactly. Yeah. So anyway, he was telling me when he was in the movement, he, he's, he's from Wisconsin and you know, their, their football team is the Green Bay Packers, and they're just, you know, crazy about their football team. And so he would tell me, you know, they're not allowed to watch football games because there's inter interracial, you know, you got black and, and white members on the teams playing together. So that's forbidden. And so he'd have to sneak around and watch, turn the volume down and, and watch the game. 'cause he loved the Packers. Right. And when the Packers would, would score a goal, he'd do like this and that.\n\nRight.\n\nAnd so then he tells me that, you know, when he got out and, and other people were, you know, were, were getting out, turns out they were doing the same thing, you know, you know,\n\nWatching the game. Oh, that's so crazy.\n\nBut he has a great story telling about, about the guys from Cameroon.\n\nOh, yeah, yeah. So I had met some embassy people from the, the country of Cameroon in Africa. And they had come out to one of my talks and, and afterwards, you know, they said, you know, I, it was really fascinating and, and America is really far behind on race relations, you know, when we first got here, we didn't realize we were black. And I was like, what? That's are you talking about? I said, we gotta talk, I gotta understand this. What do you mean you didn't realize you are black? And he's like, well, of course we realize we're black, but you see in the United States, you know, or where we're from in Cameroon, we're Cameroonian. You know, that's who we are. Like, you know, we know we're black. But he goes, you know, in the United States it's different.\n\nYou're black American, white American, you know? Yeah.\n\nHe says, we are treated differently in the United States, even by other black people, you know? Oh, we\n\nWere treated\n\nDifferently. So he says, now we know we're black.\n\nWow. I was like, wow.\n\nI took a minute to wrap my mind around that one.\n\nIt's fascinating. Well, it makes sense. They think of themselves as Cameroonian. Yeah. As\n\nAs they should. Yeah.\n\nAs they should. Yes. Yeah. Yep. Wow. Yeah. That's what's crazy when you experience racism from other black people, you're like, whoa. Right.\n\nWell now hold on. Now, you know, or\n\nDiscrimination I should say.\n\nWell, when you, when you experience it from anybody, right. But understand something. Okay. So, you know, we, we have a unique thing here called slavery. And, and Jewish people have a unique thing called the Holocaust. So if you are a white guy and you are walking down down the street, the sidewalk, and some other white guy is coming up the sidewalk, you don't know him, just a stranger. You know, you guys are gonna pass and not say a thing to, to e to to either one. You know, just, just go on by. Right. If it's a black guy, two black guys passing, they don't, they're going, yo man, what's up? They're gonna acknowledge one another because they have a shared experience. They both are descendants of slaves. They both have experienced racism at some point in their life or whatever. If, if two Jews pass who don't know each other, they're gonna go shalom because of that commonality, that experience. Okay. So unless you've had that experience, you don't, you don't react to it. Alright. So when I lived in Africa, on the continent of Africa for 10 years, I lived in Ethiopia, Ghana, Guinea, and Senegal, and visited many other countries in between 'cause of my dad's job. Right. So I can tell you, you know, all black people don't look alike. All black people don't know each other. Alright? And\n\nThat's a funny thing to say too, but you,\n\nBut you, yeah, but you know what, a lot of white people think that they, they do a lot. Yeah. Especially older, older ones. Oh, okay. Now, at one time, in, in a city, all black people probably did know each other. Okay. Because they had to go to the same school and there was only one black school in the town. Right. They couldn't go different white schools. Okay. So, yeah. You know, you, they could only shop in a certain store. They couldn't shop in every store or restaurant. Right. So yeah, they would run into each other more often. But today, you know, no, but the stigma is still there. Okay. The sentiment, especially with older people. So anyway, if I'm walking down the street and I've had this happen and some black guy from Africa is coming up the street, I go, Hey man, what's up? You know, I don't know the guy, he looks at me like, kind of strange. Like, why? I don't know you, why are you talking to me? 'cause he doesn't have that experience. Right?\n\nRight.\n\nSo we're not, you know, we're not, we're not monolithic.\n\nRight? Yeah. Well, that, that this is the only way these movements, like the neo-Nazis work, is if you don't know a lot of people from all over the world and realize we're all just people. Yep. This is, you know, it's, and it is very fear based. Right? Yeah. Because I mean, think about it, you're, you're clinging to the lowest common denominator. You all have a certain amount of melanin in your skin, and you're all from a certain part of the world. That's it. And it's really not a very good commonality. It's bound, it's terrible. Yes. Especially when you think about the differences in personalities and tastes and just how people behave. And it's not a good indicator at all. No. It's the dumbest. It really, it really is. But now there's no bearing on your character, no bearing on your intellect, no bearing on any of the things that we find fascinating and attractive about people. It's just the color of your skin, which is the dumbest fucking thing on earth. Absolutely.\n\nAnd, you know, and, and we all may engage in it somewhat. Like for example, if I like Chinese food and if I go to a Chinese restaurant, I don't wanna see a bunch of white college kids or black college kids for that matter in the kitchen cooking it for me. Right. You know, I want the authentic real deal. Right. You know, so am I being prejudice?\n\nNo, that's not prejudice. That's You wanna experience the culture. The culture. Yeah, exactly. Like if I go to an Italian restaurant, I'm assuming there's gonna be a bunch of old school Italian people back there cooking. You know, I want, I want, I want heavy accents. You know, I want the smell of garlic in the air. You know what I'm saying?\n\nDo you know where Italians came from\n\nOriginally? Yeah. I mean, I'm assuming Italy.\n\nWell, that's what they live.\n\nI mean, what are you trying to say? Well, I,\n\nI'm gonna tell you. Okay. Okay. So Italians came from Africa. They came from the Moors. Oh\n\nYes. Well, Sicily in particular, that's actually where my family's\n\nFrom. Okay. Well there you go. Okay. And they're darker in Sicily Right. Than in Rome and Venice and wherever else. Right, right. The further you move from the equator, the, the darker the skin. Right. Okay. Yeah. The Moors came, you know, and into there where we all evolved from Africa at some point in time, way back when. Right. But you know, a lot of people don't realize that, you know, and they really need to check their DNA and check their history rather than just take it from where they started, where they were born. You know, that's why I think it's so important to not ban books and ban and rewrite history at Oma.\n\nOf course. Yeah, of course. You know, there is some indication that human beings might have come out of Asia as well. In fact, one of the oldest known human skeletons that they found, which predates Lucy. No, it's another one that Lucy. Lucy, well,\n\nLucy is outta Ethiopia.\n\nRight. But Lucy wasn't a homo sapien. They found something that is a homo sapien that's 500,000 years older than when they thought homo sapiens existed. This is very recent. Wow. And so it was likely that this was taking place in multiple areas of the world, just like there's different animals in multiple places of the world. There's different primates in multiple places of the world, and there's a bunch of different kinds of human being of course. Right. There's Dennis VINs, which have just recently discovered. And then there was the, the Hobbit people on the island of Flores. Like there's a lot of, when it comes to the, the evolutionary history of human beings is very, very odd. But when you talk about like the cultural history of human beings, that's when things get really crazy because it was just a lot of people like traveling all over the place and just settling into the climate. And the reason why white people are white is just 'cause there is no sun. It's that simple. And they had to develop essentially like a giant solar panel to suck up vitamin D because they weren't getting any vitamin D from the sun. It's really that simple. And that's when it gets real weird,\n\nWhich has nothing to do with their intelligence or lack thereof. Zero.\n\nZero. You know, it, it's all environmental. And over the course of hundreds of thousands of years, people change their appearance. And you know, when you tell people that, they're like, wait, what? Right. Yeah. We, we all came from the same source. We're all destroy. It destroys, destroys. That's destroys why we could all have babies, you know, like other animals that are very different. Like there's certain fish that can have babies with other fish, but those, those fish become infertile, you know? And then like the, the same with like donkeys. Like donkeys, they don't, they can't have babies. You know, like it's a, or or mules rather can't have babies because it's a, a cross between a donkey and a horse. And you can do it, but then it can't make babies or a liger can't make babies. Right, right. But people can make babies with people obviously. 'cause we're the same fucking thing. Yeah. Right.\n\nAny, any, any culture of people.\n\nYes. Yes. Any culture of people can have babies with other cultures of people. 'cause we all come from the same source kind of wipes out the whole racism argument. Doesn't the stupid, it's the stupidest fucking thing ever because it's adaptive to environment. It's\n\nAlways your DN my DNA, his DNA are 99.9% the same. Yep,\n\nYep,\n\nYep. And that should be taught in elementary school. Yeah. Yes. Don't wait to, to teach it in college when people's minds are already solidified.\n\nYes, yes. Yes. I think that thing too, that exposure that you had to, that Nazi coming to visit you, even though it's negative exposure, it's probably good to see, you know, like when I was a kid, I was in high school when I was 14, Barney Frank, who\n\nOh yeah, I remember him. Yeah.\n\nHe, he wasn't openly gay then, but he was like one of the first openly gay members of Congress. He lived near me. He lived near me as well. I lived in Massachusetts at the time. And he was from Massachusetts, or was representative of Massachusetts. So\n\nWhen he lived in DC as a congressman.\n\nOh, okay. So this was before that, I guess then, so he was debating a member of what at the time was the, I believe it was the moral majority. And it was this really goofy guy who came out and he had like an American flag on his lapel. And I remember I was 14, and you know, when you're 14 and you see someone who's got this very, like, he was very anti-gay marriage, very anti, a lot of things, but he was a clumsy n it wasn't very eloquent, not a very compelling speaker. And then Barney Frank went up, you know, so they both spoke, spoke, this guy spoke, and then Barney Frank and Barney Frank was so much smoother, so much more articulate. He was like, and for every, all the kids that I was in school with who left, they're like, that guy made more sense. Like, this is a good thing to see. It's good that they see someone with a very narrow-minded, bigoted perspective. And then someone who is more intelligent, more has a much better vocabulary, smoother in their ability to disseminate information and to dissect the bad arguments of the other person. So we all walked out of there with like, oh, okay. And then, you know, I remember talking about it with my friends, like, yeah, that guy's a fucking moron. Let first guy, you know, like, and but nowadays, instead of that, you would only get one. You would only get the one person talking. But the one person talking without the other person talking is not as good. And this idea of protecting kids from bad ideas, because they don't want these kids to be indoctrinated by bad ideas. It doesn't work with human beings. The way to get rid of bad ideas is to confront them with better ideas. Exactly. Yep. And the fear of having these kind of debates in schools is really dangerous. It's dangerous for discourse, it's dangerous for the development of the ability to have arguments and ideas, and to be able to debate you, you have to see it done. You have to see bad thinking, good thinking. Ah, I get it. I get it. This guy's, he's more, he's more clever. He's thinking better, he's got more information. This makes sense. Yep. And if you don't allow people to make those distinctions on their own, if you just baby them and treat them like you can't expose them to these negative ideas, you, you miss out on the possibility of accepting nuance and an understanding of how a less sophisticated, less educated person can fall into these traps of these stupid ideologies.\n\nYou just nailed it. Right on. You know, right on the head man. Allowing them to see the difference. Yes. Okay. Because you know, people, how did you change those people? Darrell? No, I didn't change them. They changed themselves. Because we all know one's perception is one's reality. Right. Whatever somebody perceives becomes their reality, even if it's not real, it's their reality. Right. You cannot change their reality. And if you try, you're gonna get resistance. Right. 'cause they, they only know what they know. Right. If you keep trying, it's gonna escalate. You're gonna get loud and keep on trying, it's gonna explode. You, you call, it's gonna be rolling around on the ground, hitting each other or whatever. Right? 'cause all fights start with yelling and screaming. Right. So rather, it is, rather than try to attack somebody's reality and try to set their reality straight, don't do that. You'll fail. What you do is you offer them a better perception or perceptions. Yes. And if they resonate with one of your perceptions, like showing them, this guy speaks very eloquently. That guy speaks like a, like, like a moron. Right. Just let them see it. Yeah. Okay. That perception then resonates with them and they change their own reality. Yeah. So don't focus on how you're gonna change somebody's reality. Focus on what kind of perceptions can I offer that person that might resonate. Right?\n\nRight. And just by example, but who by who you are. Because when people see someone speak and it resonates with them and see someone speak and they, you can sense how they think of things. You can see the thought process and you go, well, who do I admire more? I admire this guy. He is like, he's, he's thinking like, this is a, an enlightened person. This is a person who's thinking in a way that I want to be able to think like that. Especially as a young kid, you know, you don't wanna be a moron when you see someone you think is a moron. You're like, okay, I'm glad I saw that guy because that guy looks like a fucking idiot. Now this guy, oh, that guy makes more sense. You know?\n\nWell, you know, when, when Jeff and I were in that Christmas grill and he felt he was getting along too well with the enemy being me, and he started beating his fist on the table.",

And he had a, he had a, a party at his house and it, 'cause he just had that record come out and it would gone number one. And he had it stuck on his fridge with a magnet. You know, like the charts with a circle around it, you know, I shot the sheriff number one, Eric Clapton and Bob Marley was at the party and apparently he found a pen and he wrote onto Clapton's fridge. No, Eric, I shot the sheriff Bob,\n\nI shot him first Bitch.\n\nThat's\n\nHilarious. But that uncut gems film is it, is it, it it, it is a perfect movie in regards to like the way it treats a degenerate gambler. He's a jewelry broker, jewelry salesman. And he's just out of his fucking mind. It's always sports, it's always this, it's, there's, there's always a game that's going on and he's betting this and it, you get so much anxiety watching the movie like, oh God, don't do that. Right. Don't do that. Don't. Oh Jesus, what are you doing? It's like the whole movie. My palms are sweating. I'm moving around in my chair because I as a kid grew up in pool halls, like from the time not grew up in pool halls, but I spent so much time between age 23 and you know, into my thirties. I was in pool halls all the time. Right. And I played a lot of pool and I was around a lot of addicted campers. And I never got it, it never hit me. But I was always just fascinated by the grip that it had on people. It was like they would, their eyes would be going back and forth. Their fucking skin would be pale. It gripped them like a drug. It gripped them like crystal meth.\n\nI, I really dislike the way in Australia we have normalized it. You know, they're doing a sports report on the news, the national news. And they'll tell you the odds. The odds.\n\nWell we do that with the UFC. The UFC. We give the odds they, they even, I don't know if they announce round by round odds, but the, I think they do, but the, I don't, I try to pay attention to it 'cause I don't vote. I, excuse me, I don't gamble on the UFC but I used to, so I used to gamble on the UFC when I first started working for them. And then I was like, I don't think I should do this anymore. No, probably not. This is a long time ago though. So what I started doing is giving my friend Aubrey, who's my business partner at on it. I started giving him tips and he was like 84%. Right? 'cause I know the sport. And a lot of these guys would be coming from Japan or coming from Russia. And I'd be like, oh, this guy on from Brazil, Anderson Silva bet the fucking house. Right? I go bet the fucking house. 'cause people do\n\nNot my house though, your\n\nHouse, not my house. But there's people that were coming across from other organizations that I was a giant fan of and the bookmakers were woefully uneducated about, especially foreign fighters. Right. And there's a thing like if you are gambling on MMA and you don't know how to fight, you're just guessing. You don't really, we're all just guessing when two guys get into the cage together. But you're really guessing. Like you really don't, you can't recognize like how fast a person is. You can't recognize how good they're at countering. You just know stats. Right. You know, but you don't know how to do it. And if you don't know how to do it, you can't really see it. You don't really know. So at A certain point in time I stopped just on my own gambling 'cause I like, I don't, 'cause I was, people were accusing me of being biased one way or the other anyway. Right. Which maybe I was, you know, I got better at that. But I wanted to make sure that no one thought that. So I was like, I'm only gambling. I'm a couple hundred bucks or something like that. I wasn't doing anything crazy. Right. But the, the fucking people that I have friends, like good friends that are just hooked and when they start talking about like fights that they're gambling on or they put so much money on this and money on that, I'm like, oh my god guy. I know guys that put millions of dollars on a fight. I'm like, oh my god. Yeah. You're freaking me out. You're fucking freaking me out man. I don't care how wealthy you are. If you put a $3 million bet on a fight and you lose, like you're not gonna sleep for a week,\n\nMan. I just wouldn't be able to wake up with myself the next day.\n\nAnd then if win, I would\n\nFeel so foolish.\n\nIf you win, it might be even worse. 'cause now you're gonna keep doing it.\n\nNow you get that, you get the sting. Yeah. The thing is with, with what we do in Australia, like the newspapers, like you know, network news services, we allow betting ads. It is so all prevailing. You know, I had an experience probably a year or two ago and I see my two boys are talking to a mate of theirs and they've all got their phones out And I realized they were checking up on their bets. You know, so I had to have a big conversation with my boys and say, look, every single dollar that you have comes outta my pocket. If I give you a dollar, that's not a dollar to gamble with. I had to have very serious conversation with 'em about, it's like, I don't care if you think it's fun, you know, I don't care. You've gotta actually see it for what it is. Yeah. Because what's five or $10 now is easily gonna turn into four or $500 in a minute. A thousand dollars. You know, sooner or later you will allow yourself to think that this thing is, you know, beyond fun and it's a way for you to earn back your losses or whatever. Right. So I just had a, had to have a, a chat with 'em and they were probably looking at me going, how old is our father that he doesn't understand that everybody does this? You know? But I just had to let 'em know from my point of view, I didn't appreciate them taking my hard earned dollars and wasting them.\n\nI get it. But I also like that it exists because I want the ability, like if I wasn't working for the UFC and I could go to the fights and gamble on the fights, I would definitely do it because it a knowledge, it wasn't to\n\nMe. Right.\n\nThis episode is brought to you by Uber Eats every football season, the same thing happens. The game somehow makes everyone really hungry. Quarterback scrambles, clearly assigned it's time for breakfast burritos, turnovers suddenly dessert at 2:00 PM doesn't sound so crazy. And wing formations. Well those can only mean buffalo wings as if they're ever not in play. Even the goalposts start looking suspiciously like french fries. It's almost like football is sending the message to eat more food. The good news Uber Eats makes those cravings easy to satisfy with game day deals all season long from wings and pizza to chips and drinks. Even last minute grocery runs, you'll find savings on all your favorites delivered straight to your door. Order Now on Uber Eats,\n\nI don't need it. If I'm into the sport. Yeah. I want to see the game, you know, I, I care about Oh yeah. What happens in the game. I\n\nGet it.\n\nPossibly because from the owner point of view, I don't, I wouldn't want any extra pressure. Of course. So I, I don't understand why here's, here's this game. It's like two teams of pristine athletes who have busted their nuts to get in this situation. And the competition, the physical competition between these two teams isn't enough. You gotta put something else on the line, you know? Well it just adds,\n\nIt adds for some people,\n\nFor some people. Yeah. Yeah.\n\nThey get that extra juice out of the knowing that, the thing is also as a commentator, I am as unbiased as humanly possible. And it's a hard thing when friends fight. 'cause there's some guys that fight that are my good friends and I'm, I'm like, I just hope they don't get hurt and I want 'em to win. But I have to be excited about the other guy winning, which is kind of crazy. The other guy's beating up your friend. Right, right. And you have to be excited about it. So it's good that I don't have any money riding on fights 'cause I don't have, I'm not happy if one person wins or loses. Right. My my idea is we're gonna see who's the better athlete, who's the better fighter. And I can handle gambling. I've never had a gambling problem because I'm, I'm not a risk averse person. Obviously I like risks, but I'm also, I'm, I'm safe. Like I know what I'm doing even though I do dangerous things.\n\nYou've had a look at it first. Yeah. You've examined, but\n\nYou do\n\nHave, you have that ability and inclination for examination. So\n\nYou have to have that. And I feel like that's the case with alcohol. That's the case with cigarettes. I'm in favor of all those things being legal. But I know so many people that have a problem with alcohol, like cannot live without alcohol. I know so many people that can't quit smoking cigarettes. I feel like you should be able to do whatever you want to do. And I want, I want freedom. And that comes with gambling. And I, I think gambling freedom, like the ability to decide that you want to take a risk of something that should be available, but we should educate people as to like, what is actually going on in your mind that's allowing you to get captured by this thing. And now you're chasing bad money and you're in a downward spiral management. Like understanding, okay, this is a thrill, but this thrill could take over your whole life. Right. If you are maybe genetically susceptible, psychologically susceptible, like understand what it is. But I don't think we should take away cars that can go over 60 miles an hour because some people crash their cars and die. You know what I mean? Yeah. It's, I, I feel like I like that gambling exists and I always wish that it existed back in the day. I was like, it'd be fun that a hundred bucks on this or a hundred bucks on that, but I don't have the problem. Like I could see if I came from a family that was torn apart by gambling and you'd go, you know, you don't understand my dad lost our house. Like, okay, but that was a bad decision. Your, you know, your dad could have died drinking and driving and smashed into a tree. These are bad decisions. You don't have to make bad decisions just because something is tempting you. It's an interesting, it's an interesting debate because do you nanny state the whole world? Do you think gambling should be illegal? Do you think you should have to go to Vegas for it? That seems kind of crazy. I mean it's certainly not a black or white issue to me. There's a lot of gray area involved in it and I know there's a lot of people that push back on the idea of, of whether these gambling apps and all these different things should be legal and like\n\nIt's the normalization process that bothers me the most. Mm. That it's part of the new service with the apps that, that it's, but it's just put in front of you whether you're interested in it or not. You know, this team is playing that team and here's the odds. Right. And I just don't, I don't think it's healthy to have that as much of, you know, tho those stats as much a part of the actual news report as who's playing and what's on the line.\n\nThe thing about it though is it does lead you to have debate about like, here's a perfect example. Canelo Alvarez versus Terence Crawford. Terence Terence Crawford was going up two weight classes. In my mind though, he's so skillful. I gave him a chance. Right. I was like, I favor him to win. But I believe he was the underdog who was the, find out what the odds were for the Canelo Alvarez. Terence Crawford fight. I believe he was the underdog even though he was an undefeated multi division world champion. Like one of the greatest of all time for sure. But he was jumping up from the 154 pound weight class where he just won the belt. He was the 147 pound weight class all the way up to 1 68. That's a big leap. 14 pounds. And everybody thought canal's gonna have too much power. He is gonna be too big. I'm like, I don't think so. I don't think that's correct. It was odds. Is it same? Yeah. Crawford was underdog. Yeah, Crawford was the underdog. So not a huge underdog. Plus 1 35 versus plus one 40 somewhere around there. So it's not huge. Not even two to one. Not even one and a half to one. But enough where I was like, I think they're wrong. You know? So it's like, it, it fosters debate, you know, even if you're not gambling. And I didn't gamble on that fight, but I did. I was telling my friends, I got a long discussion with a good buddy of mine who's a, a real boxing connoisseur. He is like, Canelo's too big, he hits too hard. I'm like, that guy doesn't get hit. Much like, I don't think that's as big of a factor as we're thinking. I think it's a skill thing. They're not that different in size. I'm like, I don't think so. And so that odds thing is to me exciting. Like, it, it fosters debate. Like you get, you start talking about, you know, and if it's a game, you start talking about players. Like he chokes in the outfield, he does this, he does that. This guy's, he's always stealing bases. I'm factoring that in and you know, the odds become a part of the discussion. But yeah, it is ultimately the problem is, first of all, kids are addicted to apps as it is. They use them, they're always on their damn phone. And they'll go from TikTok to Instagram to to x to, you know, they're check this and then they'll check that and they'll check that and they'll check their Snapchat and then they'll check the gambling app. And then it's like, you're just addicted to this goddamn phone. So something on your phone that's also addicting. It's like addiction on top of addiction. 'cause you're already getting your little dopamine rush just by looking at your phone. And then if you're also getting a gambling rush on top of that. Yeah. We gotta educate people. Yeah. But I think we gotta educate people on social media addiction, which I think a, a giant percentage of our population is completely addicted to\n\nSocial media, probably including me. I spend large amount of every day scrolling through TikTok for some reason. And\n\nWhat do you, what's your algorithm like? What kind of stuff are you getting?\n\nI'm getting a lot of dating apps at the moment, which is really embarrassing because I'm, I'm not looking on any, I'm not on any dating apps, so I'm not sure that the algorithm is fully truthful. I think there's certain amount of things you just get fed. Right. You know, for\n\nEspecially like a dating app because that's a promotion, you know? Right. They're\n\nPromoting that. Yeah. There's a lot. Seems to be a lot coming up. But that's the problem, isn't it? Because the way the algorithm shapes it, you know, pretty much everything that comes up on your phone you have some form of interest in. Right. So that keeps you looking at, at what you're looking at. Yeah. I've got to probably gotta dial it down a little bit, but I'll be in the bush in a minute. This has been such a crazy year, man. You know, so, you know, we finished Nuremberg last year and then I went on that big tour, which is when I was here, when I came to see you the first time. But this year since between December and August I made five movies. Wow. And I was on the set of the sixth and so weary and I had no juice. I, I still feel it a little bit actually, man, you know, I've had a little bit of time off, but I've still had so many responsibilities. I kind of feel like I broke my brain or something in August. Mm. And I'm still trying to recover and I won't really recover till I get home the next time. As I was saying to you before, is when I land at home now I won't know when I'm flying out again. And that is such a relief because when you do know, when you're flying out again every day is just counting down, counting down. You might have three weeks, but it doesn't feel like three weeks. Hmm. Because you 100% know when you're leaving again. But this time I'll get home and I'll have three months and I'll be in the bush and I'll be waking up with the birds and you know, hopefully all of those things that I emptied out through the, the earlier part of the year will, will fill up again.",

He's doing some,\n\nDefinitely doing some\n\nTestosterone.\n\nHe\n\nLooks jacked.\n\nHe looks jacked, right?\n\nYeah. But he didn't like, quick, quick, quick.\n\nYeah. He got jacked quick at\n\nAge. Like at 50. At age 59 In less than a year, he, he went from pencil net geek to looking like a, like the rock? Yeah.\n\nLike a little miniature alpha fella.\n\nYeah. Yeah. Like, like his neck got bigger than his head. Yeah, he\n\nGot\n\nVery quick. But then like his earlier pictures, his neck's like a noodle.\n\nI support this activity. Just see him going in this direction,\n\nWhich is fine. And his voice dropped like two octaves.\n\nI want you to move in that direction as well. I think we can achieve this. I, I,\n\nI mean, I, I should\n\nI I think we can achieve Giga Chad. That's what people\n\nCalled it. Where is that guy?\n\nBele? I don't know where he is.\n\nThat's like a real guy.\n\nThe artist? Yeah. No.\n\nOh, giga Chad. Oh, giga Chad.\n\nYeah. I don't know if that's a real guy. It's hard to tell.\n\nIt is a real guy. It is a real guy. Yeah.\n\nHe's got the crazy jaw and like perfect sculpted hair. Yeah. Yeah.\n\nWell, I mean, they may have exaggerated a little bit, but probably, but no, I think, I think he actually just kinda looked like that in reality. Oh. So like he, he's a pretty unique looking individual.\n\nI think we can achieve this. That guy right there. That's a real guy.\n\nThat's real. Dude. I think\n\nI always thought that was CGI.\n\nNo, I, I think one of the, I think the upper right one is not him. That's not that\n\nOne to the left of that. Like, that's real. No, that's, that's artificial, bro. That's fake. That's got that uncanny valley feel to it, doesn't it?\n\nIt's, it's not impossible.\n\nNo, no. It's not impossible to achieve, but it's not, it's not possible to maintain that kind of leanness.\n\nThat's a crazy No, I mean, that's like, like you're, you're, you're also at that point, you're, they're there. He's dehydrating and all sorts of things.\n\nOh, it's based on a real person. Yeah.\n\nYeah. Based on, right.\n\nBut it's not a real person. What\n\nDoes he really look like?\n\nLike those images, I think are bullshit. Some of 'em are real. Is that real? Okay. That real. That looks real. That looks a really Jack bodybuilder. Yeah. Yeah. That looks real. Like, that's achievable. But there's a few of those images where you're just like, what's going on here?\n\nYeah. Yeah. Yeah. Totally. Well, I mean, you see, you see it Is that, is that the ice? That's\n\nThe real dude.\n\nWell, there's that, that, that Icelandic dude who's Thor.\n\nOh yeah. The guy who jumps in the frozen lakes and shit. Yeah. Well,\n\nThe, the guy who played the mountain. Oh,\n\nThat guy that is, yeah. That\n\nIs like a, that, that is like a, a mutant strong human. Yes. Like, like he would be in like the X-Men or something, you know, we were hanging out. I mean, he's, he's just like, not like, and, and, and then is that, you know, that I've seen that meme tent and tent bag. No. You know how like, it's like, it's really hard to get the tent tent in the tent. Oh, right,\n\nRight. That's true. Then\n\nThere's a picture of of him and his girlfriend with\n\nOh, right. That's hilarious. Yeah. Yeah. That's, I don't know how\n\nIt gets in there, you know, it's like, seems too small. But\n\nI met Brian Shaw. Brian Shaw's like the world's most powerful man. Yeah. And he's almost seven feet tall. He's 400 pounds. And his, his bone density is one in 500 million people. So there's one, it's like, there's like maybe 16, 16 people.\n\nI mean, he dense\n\nBones. He's an enormous human being. Okay. Like a legitimate giant, just like that guy. Yeah. Yeah. But we met him. He was hanging out with us in the green room of the mothership. But it's like, okay, if this is like David and Goliath days, like Yeah. Yeah. This is an actual giant, like the giant of the Bible.\n\nOnce in a while, they get a super giant person. This is a\n\nReal, a real one. Like not tall, skinny basketball player. Yeah, yeah. Like a seven foot, 400 pound powerlifter.\n\nLike, you don't want to especially\n\nLook at him. That's the guy. See if there's a photo of him standing next to like a regular human. I was trying to get this. There it is. Yeah. That's him right there. Like,\n\nThere's like, there's like one of him with next to standing next to Arnold and stuff. Yeah. And it's where, and Arnold, everyone, everyone just looks tiny. I mean, I think he's a pretty cool dude actually.\n\nOh, Brian's very cool. Very smart, too. Unusually, you know, you expect anybody to be that big, it's gotta be a moron. Yeah. But no.\n\nYeah, there was, there was Andre the Giant who was awesome. Yeah. He was great in Princess Brian. No,\n\nHe was just awesome. Period. Yeah. Yeah. So we were talking about this interview with Sam Altman and Tucker, and I was like, we should probably just talk about this on the air, because it is one of the craziest interviews I think I've ever seen in my life. Yeah. Where Tucker starts bringing up this guy who was Yeah.\n\nA whistleblower or whatever. A\n\nWhistleblower Yeah. Who, you know, committed suicide, but doesn't look like it. And, and he's talking to Sam Altman about this, and Sam Altman's like, are you accusing me? He's like, no, no, no, I'm not. I'm just saying. I I think someone killed him. Yeah.\n\nAnd like, and it should be investigated. Yeah. Not just drop the case.\n\nIt seems like\n\nThat they just dropped the case. Yeah, yeah. Yeah. It seems, but his parents think he was murdered. Yeah. The wires to a security camera were cut blood\n\nIn two rooms,\n\nBlood in two rooms. Someone else's wig was in the room. Someone\n\nElse's wig. Wig, wig. Yes. Yes. Not, not normal. His wig not normal to have a wig laying around. Yes.\n\nAnd, and he ordered DoorDash right before allegedly committing suicide. Yeah. Which is seems unusual, you know? Yeah. It's like, you know, let's, I'm gonna order pizza on second. Thoughts, I'll kill myself. Is it seems like that's a very rapid change in mindset. It's\n\nVery weird. And especially the parents have, they, they don't believe he committed suicide at all.\n\nHas no note or anything. No.\n\nYeah. It seems pretty fucked up. And you know, the idea that a whistleblower for an enormous AI company that's worth billions of dollars might get whacked. That's not outside the pale.\n\nI mean, it's straight out of a movie. Right.\n\nOut of a movie, but Right out of a movie is real sometimes. Yeah. Right.\n\nExactly. It's like, right. It's a little weird that I think, I think they should do a proper investigation. Like what's the downside on that proper investigation?\n\nRight. No, yeah, for sure. Yeah. Yeah. But the whole exchange is so bizarre.\n\nYeah. Yeah. It is. It's\n\nSam Altman's reaction to being accused of murder is bizarre.\n\nLook, I don't know if he's guilty, but it's not possible to look more guilty, so I'm like,\n\nOr look more weird. Yeah. You know, maybe it's just his social thing. Like maybe he's just odd with confrontation and it just goes blank, you know? But if, if somebody was accusing me of killing Jamie, like, if Jamie was a whistleblower and Jamie got whacked, and then I'd be like, wait, what are you, what are you, are you accusing me of killing my friend? Like, what the fuck are you talking about? I would, I would be a little bit more irate.\n\nYeah, yeah. Exactly. You know, it'd be,\n\nI would be a little upset.\n\nYeah. It'd be like, well, you'd be like, you'd certainly in insist on a thorough investigation. Yeah. As opposed to trying to sweep it under the rug.\n\nYeah. I wouldn't assume that he got that he committed suicide. I would be suspicious if, if Tucker was telling me that aspect of the story, I'd be like, that does seem like a murder. Fuck. We should look into this.\n\nI mean, all signs point to it being a murder. Not, not saying, you know, Tim Malman had anything to do with the motor, but\n\nBlood in two rooms,\n\nBut blood in two rooms. Like Yeah, this, the wires, the security camera and the DoorDash being ordered right before suicide. No suicide note, his parents think he was murdered. And the people that I know who knew him said he was not suicidal. So I'm like, this, why would you jump to the conclusion parents\n\nJust sued the\n\nLandlord? They sued the son's landlord, alleged the owners and the managers of their son, San Francisco apartment building were part of a widespread coverup of his desk.\n\nThe landlord.\n\nYeah. There's a bunch of weird, they said there was like packages missing from the building. Some people said they saw packages still being delivered and then all of a sudden they all disappeared.\n\nHuh. Fewer. But that could, future reasons could be people steal people's packages all the time.\n\nThe porch pirate situation. Yeah.\n\nYeah.\n\nIt says they failed to\n\nSafeguard also. I mean, the amount of trauma those poor parents have gone through with their son dying like that. I mean, it must God bless 'em. And how could they be stay sane? Yeah. After something like that. They're probably, they're so grief stricken. Who knows what this episode is brought to you by the farmer's dog.

Dan Bonino the, they were trying to convince everybody of that, like, okay.\n\nThe guards weren't there and the cameras stopped working and you know,\n\nThe guards were asleep, the cameras weren't working. He had a, a giant steroid up bodybuilder guy that he was sharing a cell with that was a murderer who was a bad cop. Like all of it's kind of nuts. Yeah. All of it's kind of nuts like that. He would just kill himself rather than reveal all of his billionaire friends.\n\nYeah.\n\nAnd then\n\nDid you see Tim Dylan talking to Chris Cuomo about this? Because\n\nHe like I did. He like, yeah. Chris Cuomo just looked so stupid.\n\nTim just listed off\n\nAll the, Tim just, and he is like, I agree. It is strange. Like, of course it's strange, Chris, Jesus Christ, you can't just go with the tide. You gotta think things through. And if you think that one through, you're like, I don't think he killed himself. Nobody does. You'd have to work for an intelligence agency to think he killed himself.\n\nIt does. It does seem unlikely. It seems\n\nHighly unlikely.\n\nHighly,\n\nHighly unlikely. All roads highly unlikely. All roads point to murder. Yes. To point to They had to get rid of him because he knew too much. Whatever the fuck he was doing. Yeah. Whatever kind of an asset he was, whatever thing he was up to, you know, it was apparently very effective. Yes. And a lot of people were compromised. You see, your boy Bill Gates is now saying climate change is not a big deal. It's like, relax everybody. I know. I scared the fuck outta you for the last decade and a half, but eh, we're gonna be fine.\n\nYeah. I mean, you know, as we was saying, as I was saying just before coming into the studio with, you know, it like every day there's some crazy wild new thing that's happening. Yes. It's like, it feels like reality's accelerating.\n\nYeah. It's every day and every day. It's like more and more ridiculous. Yeah. To the point where the simulation is more and more undeniable. Yeah.\n\nYeah. It really feels like simulation. You know? It's like, come on. What are the odds that this could be the case? You know? Are\n\nYou paying attention at all to three I Atlas? Are you\n\nWatching on Oh, does the, the comet?\n\nYeah. Whatever it is.\n\nYeah. Yeah. I mean, I mean, one thing I can say is like, look, I, if, if I was aware of any evidence of aliens, you, Joe, you have my word. I'll come on your show and I will reveal it on the show. Okay. Yeah. That's a good deal. Yeah. It's a pretty good deal. I believe you.\n\nYeah. Yeah.\n\nThank you. Appreciate that. I'll, I'll stick to, I I keep my, you know, keep my promises, so, alright.\n\nYeah. I'll\n\nHold you. Do that. Yeah. Yeah. I don't And, and I'm never committing suicide. To be clear, I don't think you'll either. On camera guys. I am never committing suicide\n\nEver. If someone says you committed suicide, I will fight tooth and nail. Thank\n\nYou. I'll\n\nFight tooth and nail. Thank you. I will. I'll not believe it. I will not believe it. The thing about the three I Atlas is it's,\n\nThat's a hell of a name actually. Yeah.\n\nIt's a third. It\n\nSounds, it sounds like third eye or something.\n\nYeah, it does.\n\nThree\n\nI is a third. It's only the third interstellar object that's detected. Okay. Yeah. Avi Loeb\n\nThird eye. Yes. Yeah.\n\nAvi Loeb was on the podcast a couple days ago talking about it. Yeah.\n\nIt could be on, I don't know. But\n\nApparently today they're saying that it's changed course. Did you see that Jamie? No. Avi Loeb said something today. I'll send it to you. I know. It's on Reddit rapidly\n\nBrightens and gets blue.\n\nHere you go, Jamie. I'll send it to you right now. It's fascinating. It's fascinating also because it's made almost entirely of nickel, whatever it is. Yeah. And the only way that exists here is industrial alloys. Apparently.\n\nThere must No, there are, there are, there are definitely comets that and asteroids that are made primarily of nickel. Oh, really? Yeah. So the, the, the places where you mine nickel on earth is actually where there was an asteroid or comet that hit earth that was in nickel rich, you know, as Oh, wow. Nick Nickel rich.\n\nRight. Oh, giant nickel Rich, rich deposit.\n\nYeah. That's the, that's, that's, it's coming. Those are from impacts. You definitely didn't wanna be there at the time because anything would've been obliterated. Right. But that's, that's where the, the sources of nickel and cobalt are these days.",

      "transcript_chunk": "its core, all of that is because he's afraid. Yeah. He's afraid to die. Oof. And that is really sad. Yeah. Because you're not really present. Right. You know, and so I'd also hate for that to happen. So I don't know. It's it's, it's a dance. It is a dance I think, you know?\n\nYeah. 'cause you don't wanna say, oh, this life is just temporary. Lemme just go to shit. Lemme just fall apart.\n\nNo, you can't do that. Right. You have to protect what you have. Yeah. But like, I also, like, it's, it's also very, I didn't realize because I'd made it arguably healthy enough to, you know, 42 years old. I'm now 45, but 42 years old without realizing how many things can kill you. I think because I'd lived a pretty blessed life. Of course I'd have had some health struggles of my own, but they were, I had thyroid cancer in 2008, but I call it a baby cancer. I'm trying to dismiss the fear of it, of course, at the time. But it was never life threatening. It was life changing, but never life threatening. So the fear was situational and it was not lifelong. You know, when our daughter got sick and spending as much time as we did in children's hospitals, when you see the diseases and the illnesses that afflict so many children, it amazes me that we made it to this age. Yeah. Absolutely. Amazes me. And, and that is a realization where I finally at like, you know, 42 realized how important every day was and how much of a gift every day was. Even that we have her, you know? But that came to me through circumstance, not because I woke up one day and had an epiphany and went, we're so lucky to be alive. Like, it didn't really happen until that was threatened to be taken away.\n\nThat's un it's unfortunate like that as a civilization and, and America as a culture, that we don't have a history of embracing the moment and, and, and discussing how important It's to recognize that you're fortunate and to try to take care of yourself and that life is very temporary and fleeting. Yeah. And don't get wrapped up in nonsense. Yeah. And we just let people figure it out on their own. And we collectively, all, if we're intelligent, we try and we have some failures and successes and good friends. You figure it out eventually. Like what's really important is love and friendship and doing something you're passionate about and just trying to leave a nice mark on this life while you're here. Yeah. But that's not what's told in society. Like society's overall message is just overrun with advertising. So it's all about stuff and it's all about objects. And then you got social media where it's all about image. It's all about like this unattainable life of amazing luxury and success and glamor and Oh my God, that, that must be the most attractive thing to acquire in life. Yeah. But that's a trap. And that's not real. And like anybody who's like popping bottles with models on a yacht, I guarantee you they're depressed. That shit is not healthy. I'm sure they're depressed. That's not good for you. You're, you lack like, true intimate relationships and you're just flossing, you know, and showing your diamond crusted watch,\n\nYou're gonna have one guy that like emails you and says, I'm happy as shit. I'm popping bottles on a yacht. Sure. Yeah. I'm not depressed. Yeah, no. It's\n\nGet that guy high on mushrooms and see if he\n\nReally feels bad and see if he's really depressed. Yeah, exactly.\n\nSee what he really thinks about life.\n\nI I think that like the majority of people are suffering from some sort of mental illness. For sure. I mean,\n\nDefinitely the majority in la Yeah.\n\nWell, I think so. But a lot of the people that I'm friends with, most of the people that I'm friends with are artists that are more in touch, more sensitive. You know, my dad came to me a few years ago and my dad, my entire life told me to stop being so sensitive. Stop being so sensitive. Katie, stop taking, you're taking yourself so seriously. Oh my God. Like, stop Katie, I mean my entire fucking life. And he came to me a couple years ago and he said, I am so sorry. I told you to stop being so sensitive because it's your job. Your job is to be sensitive to everything around you, to accurately portray emotions. That's your job. And you're very good at it.\n\nWell, that's very nice of him to\n\nRecognize that side. It was very nice of him. So I think that, yes. Do people have a lot of mental illness in, in Los Angeles? Are they suffering from depression? I would argue that it, the majority of the population is, and it's not just reserved to California, but I do think that a lot of artists are, because they're more in touch with their, their emotions and their mental health.\n\nYeah. There's probably some truth to that for sure. Does your father have, do you have brothers? I do. Okay. So that's the difference. So I have all daughters. Okay. And when you have all daughters, one of the things you realize is like, oh, they're so different. It's like, they're just a totally different kind of human. It's true. You know, and when you're like, why are you upset? Because I'm treating him like you're treating her like she's a boy. Yes. You cannot treat them like they're a boy. And you know, over time it's given me a much greater understanding of females. Of the species. Yeah. Of, of female human beings. Like, they're not male human beings. No. Like when I, oh, I hang out with my, like if I go out with my wife and all of her friends and I just let them talk and observe the stuff they talk about. Like, it's like, you're, you're totally different culture. This is a totally different interests. None of my friends would have any of these conversations.\n\nBut we're also have a group of women is arguably more disgusting than men. A group of men. Oh, sexually. No, just in general. Like have you ever sat down with a group of women and like, just talked about like bodily fluid, bodi fluid, fluid\n\nFunction. Yeah. Well they, they're notorious for being the worst in bathrooms. Oh my God. They, they, anybody who cleans bathrooms says, dude, the woman's room is always fucking chaos. So gross. 'cause they have to be so clean and put together everywhere else when they get to that bathroom and they don't have any responsibility, no one's looking. They just fucking toilet paper everywhere. Fuck you. I'm not cleaning shit.\n\nIt's true. So we have, our daughter is like almost four in December, and then we have a 16 month old son. And like, we thought that like, he was gonna like come out like her, you know, like, she was like full sentences by like a year old. She was like walking at nine months. Oh no.\n\nDudes are way dumber.\n\nThis kid,\n\nLike\n\nThis kid. Yeah. He understands everything. Like he's smart, but he just like, he's like a big unit. He's huge. He's humongous. He's like 99% down. Like everything. Not just like one thing, everything. My dad the other day was like, oh, he's gonna be big. He's got a huge head. Like he's just a big\n\nKid. Well, all of his resources are set to growing stuff instead of thinking, oh\n\nMy god, he is\n\nDude's mature so much later.\n\nIt's crazy, crazy. Like, not even talking, just started walking. But the other day my husband was like, where's Granger? And I was like, I don't know where Granger is. And me find him, he is like up on the kitchen counter, like ready to start swinging from a light. And I was like, catch the baby. Like my, my, our daughter would've never, like, she's delicate, right. You know, she like, she looks at a slide five times before she goes down it. Like she climbs to the top. She changes her mind. Yeah. She really thinks about it. Like, I think she's doing math problems in her head to like, you know, like make sure she won't get hurt. And then our son is like, I'm going down Face. Face.\n\nYeah. Yeah.\n\nAnd then he like stands up, he's like, I'm okay.\n\nIt's a totally different thing.\n\nIt's a completely different thing. Yeah. Completely different. Yeah.\n\nAnd the only way to really understand them is to live with them. You have to study them. It's\n\nTrue. It's in their, in their natural habitat. Study\n\nThem like David Attenborough. You gotta study them in their natural environment.\n\nThat would actually be a really funny short, it's just like a, a David Attenborough voice. Like falling around like, you know, like children.\n\nLike children. Noticing the difference between the boys and the girls. Yeah.\n\nIn their natural habitats.\n\nWell, AI could probably do that for you and make a really good documentary. Oh my real quick. And then 10 minutes, whatever\n\nIt's called. Not\n\nIn 10 minutes. You don't have to dedicate a year to your life. Look,\n\nIt can exist. I don't need to participate in this stripping away of my, my livelihood. Listen,\n\nI understand. I mean, I'm certain there's gonna be ai, comedians and podcasters, and there's probably gonna be AI UFC commentators to do a better job than me.\n\nBut I think there it is what it is. I think there is like an AI podcast creator right now that's like pumping out\n\nPodcasts. Well, I know that there's a podcast of me and Steve Jobs and I never met Steve Jobs.\n\nOh yeah. There's\n\nA whole podcast. Is it really? Of me having a conversation with Steve Jobs?\n\nWell, that's just deep fake, right?\n\nYep. Yeah. But, but it's ai AI created the conversation.\n\nSo I think the one that I'm talking about, so the producer of my show is telling me that there's an AI where you can put in, like, I'm a potato farmer in Idaho, who's dealing with, oh, okay. A problem with a crop in 2025. And I am wondering about this. It'll put together a podcast for you specifically for that. Mm.

The the negative thing is you're gonna have like fake humans with like fake lived experiences that are like, that resonate with you, that are impactful. That's what's scary. You know, in the, we, we had these conversations with a few friends of mine the other day. You know the show Trigonometry? No. Okay. It's a very popular podcast. But my friend Francis and Constantine, they're the hosts of it. And my friend Megan Murphy was there and a bunch of comedians were there. And I was playing my favorite new song, which is an AI song. And I'm like, tell me, stop it. Tell me how good this It's a co it's a cover of 50 cent song. What up gangsta?\n\nAll right, I'm gonna need to hear this song. Okay. You need to hear it so I can participate with\n\nThis. We'll, we'll, we'll play it right here. You know, you know the original song? Yeah. We'll cut it out. You know the original song, right?\n\nWhich\n\nSong? 50 cent. What up gangsta? Yes. Okay. Wait for this. I hate to say this 'cause I love 50 cent. This is better than the original. It's a 1950 Soul cover Of what Up gangsta.\n\nOkay, now here's my question. Right? If you'd gone to 50 cent and said, can you get together with a producer and create this for me? Do you think he could have done it? Yes. Okay. Yes. But we never gave him the chance to do it. Well, so we're sort of robbing him. He\n\nHad 30 years. He could have done it at any point in time. This is so good. I know what you're saying. Okay. But just, this is my point. My point is okay, that it tricks me and I know the trick. Like I know it's a trick and I don't care. I don't care. It's that good. And no one else cared in the Green Room. Everybody's like, oh, alright. Hit it. Hit her with it, Jamie.\n\nYeah. It's,\n\nIt's a good version. Come on. That's good. That's good. Crazy. You guys Zombie. They did the best version of Zombie ever.\n\nI got a a different version with the girls singing it.\n\nOh my goodness.\n\nBarbershop Quartet singing it.\n\nOh my goodness. And Jamie\n\nFeel just does this all night long, long.\n\nI can just play 'em and like, take walks. Just which ones are good.\n\nHe sent me like 20 of 'em.\n\nI feel like, I feel like I just participated in like, the death of my industry.\n\nI know. Listen, I'm this, I'm on the same page.\n\nI I would so much rather see that in person though. Like, I would love to be at a show because that those songs were phenomenal. Yes. Like, I cannot, I cannot argue that. That was great. I I will probably ask you to send me that version of zombie,\n\nThat shifty Brent guy. They have him listed on Spotify. I, I, I'm probably blowing up their spot, but it's not a human. But they have it listed as a artist so that they could upload it. 'cause I don't think you're allowed to just upload AI versions of stuff. So they just pretend it's a guy. But it's a guy, as you said, like what one things talking about. I'm like, I don't think anybody can keep that flow, that flow where he's not breathing.\n\nHe's not breathing how, unless they're taking the, unless they're taking the breaths out. But it's too, right. And then speed. I, I don't know. I'm not a musician, so I have\n\nNo idea. I don't either. Look, there's guys like Eminem that achieved incredible flow without ai. Absolutely. That have like, like how did he do that? But that's just practice repetition. Yeah. Vocal endurance, whatever. Yeah. I mean, he just knows how to do it. But this fucking AI guy is, it's like all the best things we love about great songs just condensed. And, and, and they know what you love. That's the fucked up thing. It's like, there's so many, like, let's look at all the hits. Papa was a Rolling Stone. Look. Look at all the hits. Look, look at zombie. Let's look at this. And then mush 'em all together and figure out what are the, what are these notes that make people excited? What are the feeling? What are the words that make people like, oh yeah. You know, what are those feelings?\n\nSo, okay, so, and I, I hear all of that. It makes me, I'm literally cringing inside. I'm like dying. But like, so what do artists do? Like what do you, what do musicians do?\n\nWhat has everybody ever done? When things change, you figure it out and adapt. Just, yeah. There's, humans are always going to need humans. We love each other. You know, as much as we hate each other, we love each other more. Because most interactions that people have with other people are not negative. It's just the negative ones are so scary that we concentrate on them more. But humans love humans. And the more you need each other, the more you're gonna need human interaction. Human cooperation art. Art is going to be so much more valuable coming from a human live performances. But are we,\n\nWe're\n\nJust gonna have to adapt.\n\nAre we, are we going to know? Like, that's, that's the thing that I think is a slippery slope and that scares me the most.",
