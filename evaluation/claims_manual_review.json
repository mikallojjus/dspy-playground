      "transcript_chunk": "Joe Rogan podcast. Check out\n\nThe Joe Rogan experience\n\nTrain by Day. Joe Rogan podcast by night all day,\n\nGentlemen. How are you, sir? Good to\n\nSee you. Joe Rogan. Yeah.\n\nGood to see you.\n\nNice to see you, man. Your\n\nMovie's great.\n\nThank you very much.\n\nWhen does it come out\n\nIn the United States? It comes out November 7th. Okay. And then various dates over the next month and a half or so around the rest of the world.\n\nIt's a fucking heavy movie, man. Yeah. It's a heavy movie. Yeah. The, the trial, that footage, was that all real footage? The Holocaust footage? Yeah. Real footage of the, the\n\nPlow. That was one of the, one of the reasons that that inspired Jamie to go ahead. That he was given access to that footage, some of which has never been seen since 1946. Oh. You know, it's a very interesting way that he makes the subject matter accessible because it's such a dry topic from the outside. Right. Here's a court case. Right. You know, he's yet another courtroom drama. Right. Procedural or whatever. So I can imagine that people would see that and go, well, that's, you know, might not be an exciting watch or something, but he sort of puts the audience in this position where he allows them to start to be amused by some of the things that are going on and the interpersonal relationships. And, you know, when the commandant of the prison has to call up his two top mental health experts and dress them down for getting into a fist fire, you know, things like that kind of, it, it's, there's a charm to it. And then he gets you into the courtroom and he locks the door. Mm. And he goes, now you're gonna see what we're talking about. So I think it's a very interesting film device to disarm people before he starts giving them the, the real juice, you know?\n\nYeah. It's, it's also a fascinating psychological tape from the psychiatrist, from Kelly's perspective, you know, because the way he's describing all human beings, that all human beings are capable of these horrific acts. Yeah.\n\nAnd that's the thing that was a very unpopular take at the time, actually led to his removal from the process, because he wasn't fulfilling what the war department wanted him to say. Yeah. Which is, you know, all Nazis are crazy, you know, ruled by a mad man, and this is a unique experience, but that's not what he found. In sitting down talking to the 22 major Nazi sort of names that, that he was assigned to post-war, he realized that every single one of these people was, you know, as normal. Well, there was a couple that were pretty out there, but, you know, for the most part, he was dealing with rational men.\n\nYeah. That's what's scary. And\n\nHow the hell did they end up making this series of decisions if they're rational men? Well,\n\nIt just seems like things just get pushed slowly but surely into this unbelievably horrific place. Right. Like, it starts off, there's just, it's just a war. It starts off Hitler's in power, and then slowly but surely things get pushed incrementally. Yes.\n\nAnd that's the thing that's, you know, difficult because gigantic jumps we can all read. Right. But little incremental changes. Right.\n\nThe boiling of the frog,\n\nJust how, you know, you take away this person's rights, that person's personal power, you know, and slowly, you know, you get to a point where the average person then turns around and goes, how did we get to here? Right. You know, I thought it was, I thought it was about something else. You know, there's a smoke screen going up and I thought we were doing that, and as it turns out, it's very different.\n\nYeah. That's the one of the scariest aspects of human beings is our ability to dehumanize others, to turn others into something less than us non-human and other humans with families, with mothers and fathers and children. It's\n\nOne of the most dangerous things. I, I see it going on everywhere at the moment that we're trying to say that you're either, you know, and for one or of a better teen name that you're either red or that you're blue. Right. And humans are far more nuanced than that. They're not, we're not that extreme, you know? And that the idea that you can split all of us into two camps, it's kind of nuts.\n\nIt's nuts, you know? Yeah. It's\n\nNuts. And it takes out all the room for subtlety in a discussion, and therefore it makes communicating with each other less and less available. Well,\n\nIt's just, in this country in particular, I don't know about Australian politics, but we only have two parties, and they're both essentially financed by enormous corporations. So it's a, it's a ruse. The whole thing's a ruse. Right. And you have different social issues on each side that come up and, and then it becomes this year with us or against us. Right. Versus left. But it's, there's,\n\nIt's going nowhere good.\n\nNowhere good. Yeah.\n\nYeah. We have the same sort of, you know, two principle party system in Australia as well. But we have a slight advantage in that we are kind of on the edge of the world in a lot of ways, you know, so what I've always said is, when you're growing up in Australia and New Zealand, you're growing, you grow up looking out. Yes. You understand your own culture and all that, but you grow up looking out what else is happening in the rest of the world. What, what's happening in Europe, what's happening in America, you know, but by and large Americans grow up looking in,\n\nRight.\n\nThe principal sports are only played by American teams, American football, baseball in some instances, baseball. But they're not the types of sports that we play. Where the pinnacle of that sport is international competition. Right. Rugby union. Right. Rugby league, cricket. Right. Football, soccer, you know, so we, we grow at, with that as being the pinnacle of any particular sport if you get to represent your country. And that's only really relevant in an American sense for in an Olympic period, you know? Right.\n\nThat's it. Yeah. We never think about other sports. We mock them. We think about, you know, like, what are you doing playing cricket? You know?\n\nAnd it's a fascinating game. It's any, anybody who loves baseball generally, I've found baseball lovers are all about the minutiae. They're all about the stats and what those stats mean. You know, there might be a certain score on the board, but, you know, their, and their team might be getting beaten, but they see in the stats that there's, you know, a certain dominance in an area. And so they, you know, they still have a hope that the outcome of the game is, is may come their way. And cricket fans are, are the same as that. So the, the fact that the two never seem to meet is odd to me. It is odd. 'cause it's the same type of game.\n\nThis is, cricket is larger worldwide. Right? Much larger.\n\nYeah. Well you have the India. India and Pakistan. Yeah. And Sri Lanka and you know, countries like that with huge populations playing the game.\n\nDid you, do you guys have home runs in cricket, like where someone really cracks the ball and smashes outta the park? It's,\n\nIt's called a six. If you hit the ball over the fence without a bouncing, you get six runs. Oh, okay. And so that's, that's the run. Does that happen often in, see there's different forms of the game. You have T 20, then you have one day. So this is gonna be, this is gonna be difficult. T 20 means that each team gets to bowl 20 overs. An over is six balls. So you have 26 ball overs that you're bowling to the batting team. And they've gotta get, try and get as many runs as they can. Okay. And then you'll have a go at batting, right? So you have that version of the game, which is very short. It can be, it can happen in an evening. Then you have a one day game, which maybe, you know, starts in the afternoon, finishes by eight or nine at night. But then you have the test match. And this is what I grew up with it. It's sort of been dialed down a little bit now 'cause they brought in shorter forms of the game. But the test match is between two countries and it's played over five days. And the idea is that both teams have to bat and bowl twice. And the result will be whatever it is at the end of five days.\n\nThis episode is brought to you by, called Dara lab.

My cousin Martin was a great cricket player. He was the captain of New Zealand. My other cousin Jeffrey was also a captain of New Zealand. So I kind of grew up in a cricketing family. And it was one of the pathways for me. There was, you know, potentially play cricket, you know. But when you've got two of your cousins who are as good as they were, it's a very crowded room. You know, s like, well how am I gonna make any kind of statement here? When one of the Martin, at his peak, he was called by Sports Illustrated, I believe the Michael Jordan of world Cricket. Wow. He was a very dominant player in his day. And he used to call, we used to discuss test matches as the gentleman's war. 'cause you have a defined space, you have X amount of players and you've gotta stop that little ball in this gigantic 180 meter by 120 meter oval. You've gotta stop that little red ball from going between the players and therefore, you know, preventing the batsman from scoring runs. But that five day game, the way that it ebbs and flows, once you're into it, it's the only way you wanna watch cricket. 'cause it's like, you know, at one moment your team can be just so far ahead. You're like, Ugh. Just, you know, and then it'll turn on a dime and day two things get really dark for your team. You know, day three, you got an edge back again, day four. It's fantastic, man. And as a kid I used to go and attend every day of a five day game. Wow. Yeah. It was crazy.\n\nYeah, there's nothing like that here.\n\nNo, no. I mean, I mean, it really requires, I mean, just like, look at the, you know, five, five day game, it's like five news cycles, right? Yeah. We're not really set up for that sort of patience. And\n\nHow is it broadcast? Is it stream television? Television? Yeah, yeah,\n\nYeah. Yeah. I mean, you know, there's cables and companies and stuff have got involved now, but it used to be national network. And when cricket season was on, I mean, you know, back in the day people would come from overseas and into Australia and the summer and, and ask the question, is there anything else on television except sport.\n\nIs it, so when, when you're, do they take commercial breaks? Yep. Okay. They do. So that's the problem with soccer, right? Soccer in America, the reason why it's very hard to sell is not just that a lot of people don't play it right, but it's says there's no commercial breaks. Right.\n\nThey just keep going. You have a huge number of people who play association football, soccer in this country. Oh,\n\nFor sure. Listen, they have a, a professional team here. I've been to the game, but it's nowhere near the involvement that football has\n\nAmerican football, American football in this country. Yeah, for\n\nSure. Not even close. Yeah.\n\nWell see, all of our sports that we like in Australia, apart from cricket, tend to be quite compact. You know, 80 minute game, 90 minute game, 10 minute halftime, and it's part of your day. It's not your whole day. Right. It's like, we'll go to a football game and then we'll go and, you know, have dinner or go and do something else. So we have that same thing where the action is so continuous that the idea of stopping for a commercial break quite gets quite tricky.\n\nYeah, that makes sense. It's always been fascinating to me that rugby never took off in America. Yeah. Because it seems like kind of a more savage version of football. Yeah.\n\nWell the, the way I think it sort of plays out is you've got rugby union, right? Which is 15 men aside. Every time a player is tackled, you re-compete for the ball. You have rocks, mos, you have line outs. It's a very different game. But there's another version of rugby called Rugby League, which was played in the north of England. And that has a defined period of offense and defense. And I think that's where American football comes from. I actually own a team in Australia in the NRL, the National Rugby League, the South Sydney rabbits, the oldest team in the game, 1908, we were formed, bought the team in 2006. And it's very easy to explain to Americans, have American friends come down. I spend maybe 20 minutes talking to them and they get the game and they start to dig it. My girlfriend at the moment, actually Brittany, was one of the reasons why I really started being attracted to her because she understood the game straight away, you know? And then I find out that when she was younger, she was a cheerleader for the New Orleans Saints.\n\nOh,\n\nWow. While she was studying electrical engineering. So it, yeah, it, it's a very similar, rugby league is a very easy game for Americans to follow. Now, how it's refereed becomes frustrating where an American audience, because it's, there's so much room for interpretation, referee to referee game to game situation to situation. So it can get frustrating. I think one of the greatest things about American football from the outside, or from an objective point of view, it seems that every single thing that the, the NFL try to do is based on and across the board fairness for everyone. Mm. You know, so those, you know, the conversations were between the referees and what have you seemed to be, everybody's on the same page. And sometimes when you're watching rugby league, something that you saw somebody else get sent from the field for the week before, and now nothing happens this week, but it's the same kind of hit or whatever. I was like, what? You know, so I, I've had a few Americans get corrupt, very frustrated. Is that corruption? No, I think that's, yeah. I think it, the game moves very fast. Right. And, you know, referees don't have eyes on all sides of their head, you know?",

      "transcript_chunk": "I won't even guess, but I think Clapton was living in New York or London or somewhere. And he had a, he had a, a party at his house and it, 'cause he just had that record come out and it would gone number one. And he had it stuck on his fridge with a magnet. You know, like the charts with a circle around it, you know, I shot the sheriff number one, Eric Clapton and Bob Marley was at the party and apparently he found a pen and he wrote onto Clapton's fridge. No, Eric, I shot the sheriff Bob,\n\nI shot him first Bitch.\n\nThat's\n\nHilarious. But that uncut gems film is it, is it, it it, it is a perfect movie in regards to like the way it treats a degenerate gambler. He's a jewelry broker, jewelry salesman. And he's just out of his fucking mind. It's always sports, it's always this, it's, there's, there's always a game that's going on and he's betting this and it, you get so much anxiety watching the movie like, oh God, don't do that. Right. Don't do that. Don't. Oh Jesus, what are you doing? It's like the whole movie. My palms are sweating. I'm moving around in my chair because I as a kid grew up in pool halls, like from the time not grew up in pool halls, but I spent so much time between age 23 and you know, into my thirties. I was in pool halls all the time. Right. And I played a lot of pool and I was around a lot of addicted campers. And I never got it, it never hit me. But I was always just fascinated by the grip that it had on people. It was like they would, their eyes would be going back and forth. Their fucking skin would be pale. It gripped them like a drug. It gripped them like crystal meth.\n\nI, I really dislike the way in Australia we have normalized it. You know, they're doing a sports report on the news, the national news. And they'll tell you the odds. The odds.\n\nWell we do that with the UFC. The UFC. We give the odds they, they even, I don't know if they announce round by round odds, but the, I think they do, but the, I don't, I try to pay attention to it 'cause I don't vote. I, excuse me, I don't gamble on the UFC but I used to, so I used to gamble on the UFC when I first started working for them. And then I was like, I don't think I should do this anymore. No, probably not. This is a long time ago though. So what I started doing is giving my friend Aubrey, who's my business partner at on it. I started giving him tips and he was like 84%. Right? 'cause I know the sport. And a lot of these guys would be coming from Japan or coming from Russia. And I'd be like, oh, this guy on from Brazil, Anderson Silva bet the fucking house. Right? I go bet the fucking house. 'cause people do\n\nNot my house though, your\n\nHouse, not my house. But there's people that were coming across from other organizations that I was a giant fan of and the bookmakers were woefully uneducated about, especially foreign fighters. Right. And there's a thing like if you are gambling on MMA and you don't know how to fight, you're just guessing. You don't really, we're all just guessing when two guys get into the cage together. But you're really guessing. Like you really don't, you can't recognize like how fast a person is. You can't recognize how good they're at countering. You just know stats. Right. You know, but you don't know how to do it. And if you don't know how to do it, you can't really see it. You don't really know. So at A certain point in time I stopped just on my own gambling 'cause I like, I don't, 'cause I was, people were accusing me of being biased one way or the other anyway. Right. Which maybe I was, you know, I got better at that. But I wanted to make sure that no one thought that. So I was like, I'm only gambling. I'm a couple hundred bucks or something like that. I wasn't doing anything crazy. Right. But the, the fucking people that I have friends, like good friends that are just hooked and when they start talking about like fights that they're gambling on or they put so much money on this and money on that, I'm like, oh my god guy. I know guys that put millions of dollars on a fight. I'm like, oh my god. Yeah. You're freaking me out. You're fucking freaking me out man. I don't care how wealthy you are. If you put a $3 million bet on a fight and you lose, like you're not gonna sleep for a week,\n\nMan. I just wouldn't be able to wake up with myself the next day.\n\nAnd then if win, I would\n\nFeel so foolish.\n\nIf you win, it might be even worse. 'cause now you're gonna keep doing it.\n\nNow you get that, you get the sting. Yeah. The thing is with, with what we do in Australia, like the newspapers, like you know, network news services, we allow betting ads. It is so all prevailing. You know, I had an experience probably a year or two ago and I see my two boys are talking to a mate of theirs and they've all got their phones out And I realized they were checking up on their bets. You know, so I had to have a big conversation with my boys and say, look, every single dollar that you have comes outta my pocket. If I give you a dollar, that's not a dollar to gamble with. I had to have very serious conversation with 'em about, it's like, I don't care if you think it's fun, you know, I don't care. You've gotta actually see it for what it is. Yeah. Because what's five or $10 now is easily gonna turn into four or $500 in a minute. A thousand dollars. You know, sooner or later you will allow yourself to think that this thing is, you know, beyond fun and it's a way for you to earn back your losses or whatever. Right. So I just had a, had to have a, a chat with 'em and they were probably looking at me going, how old is our father that he doesn't understand that everybody does this? You know? But I just had to let 'em know from my point of view, I didn't appreciate them taking my hard earned dollars and wasting them.\n\nI get it. But I also like that it exists because I want the ability, like if I wasn't working for the UFC and I could go to the fights and gamble on the fights, I would definitely do it because it a knowledge, it wasn't to\n\nMe. Right.\n\nThis episode is brought to you by Uber Eats every football season, the same thing happens. The game somehow makes everyone really hungry. Quarterback scrambles, clearly assigned it's time for breakfast burritos, turnovers suddenly dessert at 2:00 PM doesn't sound so crazy. And wing formations. Well those can only mean buffalo wings as if they're ever not in play. Even the goalposts start looking suspiciously like french fries. It's almost like football is sending the message to eat more food. The good news Uber Eats makes those cravings easy to satisfy with game day deals all season long from wings and pizza to chips and drinks. Even last minute grocery runs, you'll find savings on all your favorites delivered straight to your door. Order Now on Uber Eats,\n\nI don't need it. If I'm into the sport. Yeah. I want to see the game, you know, I, I care about Oh yeah. What happens in the game. I\n\nGet it.\n\nPossibly because from the owner point of view, I don't, I wouldn't want any extra pressure. Of course. So I, I don't understand why here's, here's this game. It's like two teams of pristine athletes who have busted their nuts to get in this situation. And the competition, the physical competition between these two teams isn't enough. You gotta put something else on the line, you know? Well it just adds,\n\nIt adds for some people,\n\nFor some people. Yeah. Yeah.\n\nThey get that extra juice out of the knowing that, the thing is also as a commentator, I am as unbiased as humanly possible. And it's a hard thing when friends fight. 'cause there's some guys that fight that are my good friends and I'm, I'm like, I just hope they don't get hurt and I want 'em to win. But I have to be excited about the other guy winning, which is kind of crazy. The other guy's beating up your friend. Right, right. And you have to be excited about it. So it's good that I don't have any money riding on fights 'cause I don't have, I'm not happy if one person wins or loses. Right. My my idea is we're gonna see who's the better athlete, who's the better fighter. And I can handle gambling. I've never had a gambling problem because I'm, I'm not a risk averse person. Obviously I like risks, but I'm also, I'm, I'm safe. Like I know what I'm doing even though I do dangerous things.\n\nYou've had a look at it first. Yeah. You've examined, but\n\nYou do\n\nHave, you have that ability and inclination for examination. So\n\nYou have to have that. And I feel like that's the case with alcohol. That's the case with cigarettes. I'm in favor of all those things being legal. But I know so many people that have a problem with alcohol, like cannot live without alcohol. I know so many people that can't quit smoking cigarettes. I feel like you should be able to do whatever you want to do. And I want, I want freedom. And that comes with gambling. And I, I think gambling freedom, like the ability to decide that you want to take a risk of something that should be available, but we should educate people as to like, what is actually going on in your mind that's allowing you to get captured by this thing. And now you're chasing bad money and you're in a downward spiral management. Like understanding, okay, this is a thrill, but this thrill could take over your whole life. Right. If you are maybe genetically susceptible, psychologically susceptible, like understand what it is. But I don't think we should take away cars that can go over 60 miles an hour because some people crash their cars and die. You know what I mean? Yeah. It's, I, I feel like I like that gambling exists and I always wish that it existed back in the day. I was like, it'd be fun that a hundred bucks on this or a hundred bucks on that, but I don't have the problem. Like I could see if I came from a family that was torn apart by gambling and you'd go, you know, you don't understand my dad lost our house. Like, okay, but that was a bad decision. Your, you know, your dad could have died drinking and driving and smashed into a tree. These are bad decisions. You don't have to make bad decisions just because something is tempting you. It's an interesting, it's an interesting debate because do you nanny state the whole world? Do you think gambling should be illegal? Do you think you should have to go to Vegas for it? That seems kind of crazy. I mean it's certainly not a black or white issue to me. There's a lot of gray area involved in it and I know there's a lot of people that push back on the idea of, of whether these gambling apps and all these different things should be legal and like\n\nIt's the normalization process that bothers me the most. Mm. That it's part of the new service with the apps that, that it's, but it's just put in front of you whether you're interested in it or not. You know, this team is playing that team and here's the odds. Right. And I just don't, I don't think it's healthy to have that as much of, you know, tho those stats as much a part of the actual news report as who's playing and what's on the line.\n\nThe thing about it though is it does lead you to have debate about like, here's a perfect example. Canelo Alvarez versus Terence Crawford. Terence Terence Crawford was going up two weight classes. In my mind though, he's so skillful. I gave him a chance. Right. I was like, I favor him to win. But I believe he was the underdog who was the, find out what the odds were for the Canelo Alvarez. Terence Crawford fight. I believe he was the underdog even though he was an undefeated multi division world champion. Like one of the greatest of all time for sure. But he was jumping up from the 154 pound weight class where he just won the belt. He was the 147 pound weight class all the way up to 1 68. That's a big leap. 14 pounds. And everybody thought canal's gonna have too much power. He is gonna be too big. I'm like, I don't think so. I don't think that's correct. It was odds. Is it same? Yeah. Crawford was underdog. Yeah, Crawford was the underdog. So not a huge underdog. Plus 1 35 versus plus one 40 somewhere around there. So it's not huge. Not even two to one. Not even one and a half to one. But enough where I was like, I think they're wrong. You know? So it's like, it, it fosters debate, you know, even if you're not gambling. And I didn't gamble on that fight, but I did. I was telling my friends, I got a long discussion with a good buddy of mine who's a, a real boxing connoisseur. He is like, Canelo's too big, he hits too hard. I'm like, that guy doesn't get hit. Much like, I don't think that's as big of a factor as we're thinking. I think it's a skill thing. They're not that different in size. I'm like, I don't think so. And so that odds thing is to me exciting. Like, it, it fosters debate. Like you get, you start talking about, you know, and if it's a game, you start talking about players. Like he chokes in the outfield, he does this, he does that. This guy's, he's always stealing bases. I'm factoring that in and you know, the odds become a part of the discussion. But yeah, it is ultimately the problem is, first of all, kids are addicted to apps as it is. They use them, they're always on their damn phone. And they'll go from TikTok to Instagram to to x to, you know, they're check this and then they'll check that and they'll check that and they'll check their Snapchat and then they'll check the gambling app. And then it's like, you're just addicted to this goddamn phone. So something on your phone that's also addicting. It's like addiction on top of addiction. 'cause you're already getting your little dopamine rush just by looking at your phone. And then if you're also getting a gambling rush on top of that. Yeah. We gotta educate people. Yeah. But I think we gotta educate people on social media addiction, which I think a, a giant percentage of our population is completely addicted to\n\nSocial media, probably including me. I spend large amount of every day scrolling through TikTok for some reason. And\n\nWhat do you, what's your algorithm like? What kind of stuff are you getting?\n\nI'm getting a lot of dating apps at the moment, which is really embarrassing because I'm, I'm not looking on any, I'm not on any dating apps, so I'm not sure that the algorithm is fully truthful. I think there's certain amount of things you just get fed. Right. You know, for\n\nEspecially like a dating app because that's a promotion, you know? Right. They're\n\nPromoting that. Yeah. There's a lot. Seems to be a lot coming up. But that's the problem, isn't it? Because the way the algorithm shapes it, you know, pretty much everything that comes up on your phone you have some form of interest in. Right. So that keeps you looking at, at what you're looking at. Yeah. I've got to probably gotta dial it down a little bit, but I'll be in the bush in a minute. This has been such a crazy year, man. You know, so, you know, we finished Nuremberg last year and then I went on that big tour, which is when I was here, when I came to see you the first time. But this year since between December and August I made five movies. Wow. And I was on the set of the sixth and so weary and I had no juice. I, I still feel it a little bit actually, man, you know, I've had a little bit of time off, but I've still had so many responsibilities. I kind of feel like I broke my brain or something in August. Mm. And I'm still trying to recover and I won't really recover till I get home the next time. As I was saying to you before, is when I land at home now I won't know when I'm flying out again. And that is such a relief because when you do know, when you're flying out again every day is just counting down, counting down. You might have three weeks, but it doesn't feel like three weeks. Hmm. Because you 100% know when you're leaving again. But this time I'll get home and I'll have three months and I'll be in the bush and I'll be waking up with the birds and you know, hopefully all of those things that I emptied out through the, the earlier part of the year will, will fill up again.",

      "transcript_chunk": "paralysis tick. And they realized, she realized that between her and this other girl that looks after the, the puppy and we're not there, they'd got their dates mixed up. And so it wasn't actually covered for flea and tick, you know, stuff in its bloodstream. Mm. So very dangerous. So they had to shave the dog completely and everything. And they, they pulled off another couple of ticks, but there was only just the one paralysis tick. So it's okay. But if you leave that, and if you don't deal with it, the dog's gonna be dead in a minute.\n\nParalysis\n\nTick. Yeah. Yeah. It gets into their, into their body. And, and it is, it, it affects them the way the name says on the box, the\n\nParalysis. There's one that's going on in America now called, called the Well, what it, what it gives you. It's, it's a lone star tick is what what gives you this bite. And this produces something called Alpha Gal. And it makes you allergic to red meat. What? Yeah. It's my friend, my good friend Evan Fer. Got it. And he, he was allergic to red meat for a good solid year. And then eventually it went away. And then it came back again Recently. It's, it's a huge pain in the ass. So\n\nWe, we have ticks in Australia, but we've never had to deal with Lyme disease like you have here. Mm. But in the last, you know, four or five decades, people started raising deer in Australia for, for meat and what have you. And a few of them get away. You know, there's, there's no deer farms around where I am, which is north of Sydney by 600 Ks. But recently a couple of the guys that worked for me on the farm said they've seen deer going through the bush at the back of my block. You know, so that means that there's some just animals that have escaped, and they're most likely to have been in the southern highlands, which is south of Sydney. And somehow they've got themselves all the way up to where, where I am. How\n\nMany miles is that? Or kilometers?\n\nWell, we're probably talking about 700 something kilometers.\n\nThey just wandered. Yeah.\n\nWow. And, and didn't get run over or didn't get, you know, that's crazy.\n\nThat's\n\nAbsolutely.\n\nAnd they're probably bringing ticks,\n\nProbably and the wrong tics.\n\nYeah. In America, they have a problem with That too. Deer farms and this disease called chronic wasting disease, and it's spread throughout, large swaths of America have a giant issue with this, where deer herds get infected. My friend Doug Duran, he has a, a farm out in Wisconsin and they, they've had a significant problem with it to the point where they've started issuing more tags and thinning the herd. They're trying to kill more deer to try to lessen this spread of this stuff. Right. 'cause chronic wasting disease, it get, it's a PreOn disease, so it's like, it, it gets on plants. It has, it stays on them for a long time. So, and they start drooling when they have it. And in that drool is more chronic wasting disease. Right. So another deal will come along and graze on the ground where they drool, then they get it. Horrible, horrible disease. And a lot of it emanated from these deer farms\n\nWhen I first bought the farm, which was a hundred acres to start with, but it's now like 1700 and it's attached to a state forest as well. So I can get up behind my place and go for days. Oh wow. Which is just sort of like, you know, which is cool, but back in the day, we used to have platypus in the creeks. We had wombats, and now I see more foxes down. I see native animals, or I see an equivalent amount of foxes as I see wallabies\n\nAre foxes invasive. Yeah. Yeah. Okay.\n\nThere you go. And they're absolute, you know? Yeah. Because they eat anything and everything. Yeah. I used to have a big family of what we call bush turkeys living behind the house, and they're still there, but they used to just proudly walk around, you know? And, and it was fun. You'd going through the bush and then suddenly there's a road full of bush turkeys. It's great, you know, but now the population is right down and they're totally ninja now. You know, you don't see them very often when you do, they're like very suspicious. They checking you out, you know, he's just being\n\nHunted 24 7.\n\nIt's foxes, man.\n\nYeah. You also have a, a large feral cat problem,\n\nRight? Gigantic. Yeah, gigantic. The one and only cat that I let my mother have at the farm. This is way back man. I was training for Cinderella, man. And, you know, they sent me this group of boxes, Olympic guys and stuff like that. And every single one of 'em can smash the piss outta me in the ring. So I've gotta smash the piss outta 'em in other areas. So I train them until they drop, you know, getting them on bicycles and taking them to the bush, you know, and things like that. Just to sort of like, keep the balance, you know? Right. And this one particular day, and I had it in my mind that I was just gonna absolutely smash them. I was gonna get into this situation 'cause it's one road, you know? And I was just gonna get so far in front of them, psychologically damage them, you know what I mean?\n\nSo, and I, I just devious, yeah. Just\n\nHad a conversation with my mom and she was like, oh darling, you know, I, you know, I'd really love to have a cat. And I'm like, mom, we lived in this privileged situation. We've got sulfur, crested, cockatoos roses, king parrots, all these beautiful birds. And the worst thing that we could do for them is put a cat into that. So you can't have a cat. You know, I'm riding through the bush, 25, 30 Ks in at this point, right. I'm getting to the top of this hill. I'm looking down, I'm seeing these boys struggling quite some distance, probably about a kilometer and a half away from me, you know? And I'm going, good, I'll just have a little rest here. And I just hear this little noise and I'm like, what the hell is that? So I just take three or four steps off the road. You know, probably about seven or eight minutes ago, I was coming around this corner and a car was there on the road, which is kind of unusual for the state forest in that particular area. Right? So I take these three or four steps in and there's a little kitten sitting in the bush, like, what the hell? So I pick it up, it's warm, you know, I can't leave it here. So I, I put it in my backpack, right? And I complete the ride. I get to the top of this hill where this t trig station is, and everybody's standing around and I go, oh, I found a cat. You know? So I bring it out, everyone's, all these big boxes go, ooh, you know, cute little kitten. So I took it home to my mom. I said, okay, here's your cat. You know, and the way that I reasoned it is like, this is me saying to my mother, you cannot have something that will make you happy. And then the universe goes, listen to your mother. So, you know, that cat hated human beings for the rest of its life, you know? Wow. The only person it got on with was my mum. And we used to have like four bells around his neck. So to give the birds enough warning so it didn't cause too much damage. So\n\nWas a feral cat then,\n\nI think? Or was\n\nIt tossed outta that car?\n\nI think so, yeah.\n\nOh, it\n\nWas too clean and too warm for it to have been living. But that's what people do. That's, they have a problem. They have a cat that has a litter. They dunno how to solve it. Pet stores don't want it. Their friends don't want it. So they come up with the concept of just chucking them into the bush.\n\nWell, didn't it start out what they brought, they introduce cats to try to eliminate some other animal.\n\nWe have such a history of stupidity in that regard. Have you heard of the cane tote?\n\nYes. Yes.\n\nIt's just so fantastic. Right? Yeah. So, you know, they're growing sugar cane in Queensland and there's a particular flying creature that they want to control. So they start looking around. We always blame the British for this. 'cause it's usually, it's usually a naturalist, a British naturalist or scientist that comes up with the concept. And so they, they look through all the ahs, can't remember where they found it from, but they, they found this toad who seemed to have this appetite for this particular insect. And they would feed it, it ate at them. Great. So we'll introduce the cane toad to get amongst the sugar cane and lessen that creature. When they were checking if the cane toad would eat the creature, they were feeding it dead once. Right? It's a flying creature. Toad doesn't have a tongue like a frog. Can't catch this thing if it's flying. Oh. So, my God, it was of no use at all. Oh my God. In trying to lessen that com population. However, it became like a dominant species. And it was in Queensland, but now it's starting to come in New South Wales. So they're basically marching south. And it's a problem, man. It's, it's like a serious problem. They secrete poison. So if a dog gets interested and the toe gets afraid, the dog can sort of like sniff or lick its head, then get poisoned and that's the end of your dog, you know? But there was a period of time there where there's actually a documentary from the nineties called Cane Toads. And it sort of just points out how crazy people were getting with it. You know, people in a small country towns walking from their house to the pub, taking a cricket bat and just smacking the cane toes off the road as they went. You know, it's like all these people becoming like, you know, crazed with the idea of, of getting rid of the cane toe population. But it, it hasn't affected them. They just keep growing. How much\n\nIs the population now? How big is it?\n\nSo big? And these things, Jamie, can you do me a favor? Look up the weight of the largest cane toad that they found. Because it's, it's always a surprise. I mean, these things grow and if they're in the right environment and things that they can eat and feed on, they just get bigger and bigger. That's not the biggest. Look at this thing. Look at this thing, mate.\n\nWhoa. That's like an English bulldog.\n\nHowdy duty. It's bigger than my dog.\n\nOh my god. Bigger than one. My dogs look at his head. What is the weight on that fucker? What does it\n\nSay?\n\nThat's crazy.\n\nYep.\n\nI gotta find another one to add. Fuck me. Hold on.\n\nI gotta weight there.\n\nIt say how big\n\nThat was a record. Of course.\n\nIt's Oh, fat. That fucker is 2.7\n\nGrams. 5.8 pounds. Wow. That looks bigger than 5.8 pounds.\n\nIt does. But it might be a perspective thing either way. I said that\n\nWas the current one.\n\nOh. Show the video. Scroll up so you can see that video. Or make it larger, like when she's holding it. Yeah. It looks like about five pounds. Boy. Have you ever seen when they, there's a lot of horrible videos online where they take toads and they put 'em in a box with mice. You ever see what toads do to mice? No. You would never think that toads are ferocious. Right. You know, you'd never think that toads are basically monsters. These just giant mouth monsters that swallow mice's hole. But they do. They're super aggressive. It's crazy to watch. Jamie. I know you're gonna get one. I just had to\n\nMake sure it was worth pulling\n\nUp. Is this a good one? Yeah, but there's, there's ones where there's a bunch of 'em in boxes. See, this one is kind of weird because he's not freaking out yet.\n\nHe's being sneaky. Oh, what's that? Look at\n\nThat head. See him get excited. Look at his head. I mean, if that thing was giant, like that was a hippopotamus shaped chasing after you. Ah, look how quick that is. How did, how did he get it?\n\nHe must be closer than it\n\nLooks like. He just swallowed 'em whole. Yeah. Oh, watch how quick he does it. Yeah. This\n\nBit here. Oh, it's just one step forward and bang. Yeah,\n\nJust snap. Yeah. Go see if he could find one of them video. Oh, he just inhales them. Like, he literally inhaled him. He's got a little bit of a tongue. Oh, he, he grabbed him with the tongue first. Right? He yanked him in. Oh God. See if you can find those videos where there's a ton of them in a box.\n\nWe're getting two live feedings of the mice like this.\n\nEither way,\n\nThat's a giant bullfrog. It's not a cane to slightly different\n\nGiant African bullfrog either way. Point is they eat mice, they eat 'em whole. Right? And, and how many of 'em are now in Australia? How many million? Oh, here we go. This guy's just gonna go ham. It starts. Oh, he's gonna eat all of them. Look how gross those things are. They look so dumb. Just so mindless and, and gross.\n\nNo, I don't think he's gonna get all of 'em. Video's not long enough.\n\nHe hasn't gotten any of them. I can, what's going on here\n\nPast it,\n\nJust gathering them in a corner. Ugh.\n\nIt's, it's a creepy animal. So and so look, what are the numbers? Like, put that into perplexity\n\nCane toads.\n\nYeah. How many cane toads? Ask our sponsor, how many cane toads are in Australia? And what was the initial deposit? Like? How many They drop off that I had it,\n\nIt was only a couple hundred. And then they bred like 60,000 in 1937. And the answer for now is estimated at 200 million.\n\nMan. And that little flyer that eats the sugar cane, it's still there. Oh\n\nMy god. 200 million. Yeah.\n\nBut see, look, if you see where those that see that cluster of light blue balls, right? They basically in there, in the middle of that, that cluster is where they dropped them to start with. And look at how they've,\n\nWell they're gonna make their way across the whole\n\nCountry. Oh, there you go. 40, 49. So the white one is actually where they put them to start.\n\nWow.\n\nAnd everything else is migration.\n\nAnd by 2000, look how far they've gone. Mm. Wow. What's the plan to get rid of those things?\n\nI'm not sure that they have a cohesive plan. There's no\n\nPlan. Well, that's the problem. If they have a plan, they're gonna bring in some lizard or something. Yeah. In\n\nFrogs that's gonna end up gonna end up, you know, doing something else. Yeah. It's gonna\n\nKill everything\n\nElse. Every single time they've done that. You know, like in New Zealand for example, they introduced the goss bush as a way to have hedging instead of fences. But New Zealand's got a way higher rainfall and sunshine hours than England where it came from. So now it's just everywhere, you know. So beautiful arable farmlands just taken over by Gores. And when it grows in Australia, in New Zealand, it grows thicker and more prickly and much harder to, to deal with. We have the same thing in Australia with plants like Lantana just everywhere, all through the bush, you know, in my lifetime. So in 96 I used to be able to walk through certain areas of my property, just under tall trees with, you know, subtropical ferns and vines on the ground. Now there's many areas of my property that are just impossible. You cannot get through it anymore. 'cause it's choked out with introduced weeds.\n\nWhat is that crazy plant down south that we talked about Once that is overrun some of these forests, it's pretty beautiful, but it's also very creepy to see what it's done. Just like taken over all the trees, all the trees, all the, anything on the ground just covered wisteria. It, it's called kudzu. Kudzu. Yeah.\n\nI'll show you. I'll make sure this is the right stuff. That's\n\nWhat you're talking about? Yeah. That's it. Look at that. Right?\n\nIsn't\n\nThat nuts? Yeah.\n\nLike\n\nThat image is creepy. I mean, that's like a steaming\n\nAt the back of my place, man. I used to have that waterfalls and creeks.\n\nLook at that. It's taking over that whole building. That's crazy. Everything. Yeah. Just where'd they come from?\n\nSee, that's in Fiji.\n\nYeah, it's in the United States though. So what was it, how was it brought in?\n\nChina, Korea, Japan.\n\nOh, did people bring it in on purpose? That's\n\nWhere it's, that's where it's originated from.\n\nSorry. Right. History of us introduction introduced from Japan in 1876. Yeah. New Orleans Exposition. Oh, that's where I heard there's a lot of it. Vine was widely marketed in the southeast as an ornamental plant, and then it just took\n\nOver California.\n\nWow. It's, it's funny when people try to do that.",

      "transcript_chunk": "was. But that against the reality of his life and how he grew up, how he was educated, what his experiences were, who he really was as a man. There's a lot more to Goering than just looking at this going, oh, bad man Nazi. You know, he, one thing I find fascinating, when he was a kid at school, he was like one of the dumbest students in his class at a normal school. And because of his sort of continuous failure as a punishment, he got sent to military school. In military school. He was a top student because it was stuff that interested him. He comes out of school pretty much on the dawn of the first whole war, has his first military experience in the infantry as a young officer gets wounded and realizes that standing on the ground and on a battlefield is not really the right place for him. And what's interesting him is what keeps going on overhead. So he manufactures a way to get himself assigned to a, a fighter squadron is supposed to turn back up for duty with his infantry squadron. But sort of, you know, manufactures a way to keep him as associated with the fighter and learns how to become a pilot while he is doing that. And at A certain point in the war, they're losing more pilots and they train. So they go, he knows how to fly. He can be a pilot, finishes the first world war with 22 kills air to air kills. That's three times the fighting. A and he's also, because he recently passed in battle at the end of the first World War, he's in charge of the Baron v Von Richtofen, the Red Baron Squadron, which is the pinnacle of the German air force. So here he is as a young man, he's finishing that first war experience and he is a fair dinkum, which means true, he is an actual war hero. And so through the twenties he's on cigarette cards in Germany by a packet of cigarettes. And there's a picture of Herman Goring, you know? Wow. So, and he goes into that political environment, that post bizarre environment with a, a very definite belief in his country as being something special. And he wants to make a contribution to bring lifting his country out of the mare that it's, it's currently in. So he starts looking for a political connection and ends up going upstairs in a coffee house in Munich, I think it was. And hearing a fellow called Alf Hitler talk and, you know, realizes that he has a lot in common with this guy. Or he sees things and knows that Hitler was a soldier. You know, it's a funny thing we put into the movie at one point, 'cause there's a speech about Rami that Rami Mallick makes about Hitler being a failed painter and a not very good soldier. And I think the response I gave ing at the time, which is not in the film, but he talks through Hitler's actual military record. And yeah, he didn't, he didn't rise above Lance Corporal, but he turned down promotion three different times. He won an Iron Cross in 1914, and then he won a second one in 1918. And doing things that were showing such extreme courage that he was awarded the Iron Cross. And he, he delivered messages on the battlefield. He would take the messages from headquarters and take it to the frontline troops and then bring their response back. Things like that, you know. So now one point in time I had going say, you know, you call him a failed painter, but maybe he got to A certain point in his life where there were more important things to address than painting. So, you know, nuance, you know,\n\nI thought it was also fascinating that you guys delved into the fact that he was an addict.\n\nYeah. We only touch on it a little bit. Yeah. But that's, that this crazy, there's really good book blitz. I can don't remember the name. Norman Oler. Blitzed, yes. Yeah. Which gave me on a podcast, which gave a lot of information. 'cause brilliant, when, when go was arrested, he had something like 40,000 pills on him,\n\n40,000\n\nIn his car. Right. He had a, a habit of 40 to 50 a day. Right. So you look at him and you can, you can see it when you, when you know that fact and you start looking at photographs, you can see him kind of leave the planet at A certain point where he's just off his tits all the time. You know, from about 42 onwards. He doesn't really have adults' ear anymore. Bels, Himmler, hydric, they've all taken those positions. The things that he promised he could do with the look wafer didn't actually come off, you know, as strongly, they didn't know it at the time, but that's the enigma machine. Everything, the codes being broken. So no matter what they did, they were always being second guessed. So, you know, Hitler's trust of him was adjusted a little bit. And I also sort of liken it to him, knowing he's gonna get stabbed. So he just doesn't bother going to the place where he would get stabbed. You know? So he does a whole bunch of other stuff and he keeps his authority, but he's not at in the center of things anymore from that 'cause\n\nOf the pills. A big part of it,\n\nBig part of it, it's personal safety. 'cause he thinks like he's no longer has the definitive ear and trust of his leader. The pills overtake his lifestyle and he decides to, you know, interest himself in, in other things for the greater good of Germany. Like the collection of great works of art and things like that. You know. But there's a, you know, a lot of things in this story that, that are just bigger once you start looking at it and examining, they're way bigger than what we know or what we commonly understand. And that's what I was looking for, to try and find a way to, you know, understand his base motivations. And at the end of the day, he, he, you know, in his own way, he's a pure patriot, just so happens to be a sort of a, a set of beliefs or whatever that most of us in the, in a western world would call ab barrant.\n\nWow. And and you gotta take into consideration the drug aspect of the entire Nazi movement. The, all the troops were on meth. Yeah. Hitler was on opiates. I mean, Norman Oler, that book just, I, I can't recommend it enough. It's so eyeopening. 'cause you're like, well that makes sense. That's why they were so fucking psychotic. That's why\n\nThey could march through the night where\n\nThey could push three nights in a row. Yeah.\n\nThrough the, the Belgian forest.\n\nBut it's very rarely taught. This is not like when we grew up, we didn't grow up thinking that they were just drug psychotic, you know, animals that were on meth, you know, in, in tanks. And the most, the, the, that gave the people the front line, the most meth. So they had different dosages for different people depending on what they were required to do. And the tank guy got the\n\nMost meth. And if you think about ING's position, he's the one ordering the drugs. Right. How many pilots have we got? How many planes? How many missions are we doing? How many sorties Right? Do that multiplication add? 10%. For me, fucking,\n\nIt's a drug fueled war. Like probably the most drug fueled war ever. I mean, the kamikazes were using meth. And then the, the Hitler thing was, I always thought that hi hit Hitler was meth as well. But Norman was saying that he was opiates as well. Right. So just like ging. Right.\n\nThey,\n\nMaybe it was how they dealt with what they were doing. They all just stayed blasted outta their fucking head all day long.\n\nWell, I mean, look, you're surrounded by guys that have a sort of a fanatical mindset. You know, you, you're gonna wanna be awake. Yeah. You know, you don't wanna fall asleep at the wrong time if that's the group of people that you've surrounded yourself with. And that's the thing that I keep saying. It's a, it's an old cliche, but I, I think it's something that he, he really learned, you know, if you lie down with dogs, you're gonna get fleas, Herman. Yeah. You know? Yeah. But I think him cleaning up by being forced by being in a prison environment, being forced by the allies to go cold Turkey nearly killed him. He had sort of heart problems because he went from 40 or 50 a day to nothing. So, but that clarity of thought that he had after being clean for, you know, six or nine months when the trial starts, that became dangerous. Because now he's sort of got his faculties back. And his intent on breaking down this whole idea of international law as, as being ridiculous. That, you know, he's a man who served his country. He's still in a uniform. He's still like a, a, a military guy. So he's quote unquote following orders. Yeah. And, you know, they were a demo democratically elected government who then step by step dismantled democracy once they were in power.\n\nAnd the fascinating thing about this character, and the way you play him is, in the beginning, he seems like a guy on opiates. 'cause he's like so relaxed about everything. You know, it's like he doesn't seem to be carrying the weight of what's happened to him. Right. And for you to, and then there's dark moments, particularly like during the trial where you are like, whoa, there's a lot of range to this guy. And that's gotta be a weird place to be to, for you to try to put yourself in the mind of what ultimately became one of the most horrific figures in modern history.\n\nYeah. It's not comfortable. It's not comfortable, but that, that pain's part of the gig, you know? Yeah. It, it really is. And there's, you, you, you sort of learn to accept it. And I say this to people quite a lot 'cause they, you know, big question is how do you turn off, you know, when you've been a Nazi for a day, what do you do to relax?\n\nDefinitely don't do method.\n\nYeah. But the, the, you know, you ask anybody and, and you would be the same just because in a little while the podcast is over for the day, doesn't mean that that's the end of your job. Doesn't mean you're just gonna turn off and never think about it again until you're gonna, obviously, you know, anybody has a passion for the thing that they do is gonna continue the process. Five o'clock might be when the office closes, but you're gonna go home, you're gonna have dinner, you're gonna think about the deal that you're currently doing, the presentation that's ahead of you, or whatever it happens to be. You're gonna keep processing. And that's what happens when you, you're playing a character. 'cause you might have delivered x amount of dialogue today, but you've got x amount tomorrow too. So you've gotta keep that process going. So,\n\nSo you're just thinking about a Nazi\n\nAll the time, time 24 7 all the time. There's no, it's relentless. One, one description of of making a movie is that it's a train journey. It's not like a car, you know, where you can pull over and have a wee on the side of the road. It's a train journey. And once you get on that train, you're staying there until it gets to its destination. And you've just gotta accept that. I mean, and that there's, you know, good and bad. And that there's a, a, a saying that goes with this, you know, the, the best thing and the worst thing about the job that I do is that one day it's gonna finish. Always finishes. You can be having the worst time of your life, but it's gonna finish. But you can be having the greatest time, you know, have the incredible relationship with the crew and the cast and the director. But it's gonna finish. And you have to get used to that. You have to understand that.\n\nWhen, how much time did you prepare and how much time did you film for? So like how much time were you actually in the head of this Nazi? Well,\n\nI, I signed on in 2019. So\n\nYou started thinking about\n\nIt then? I thought I was going straight from loudest voice, which finished shooting around April or something like that. And I thought by the end of that year we'd be doing, you know, we would've shot that film.\n\nSo that's when you started researching it. Yeah.\n\nAnd then as it turns out, we got set up and collapsed three different times. And so I had five years, five years of, you know, scratching around trying to find little bits of information to humanize him in my mind, but also for me to try and understand him and understand the, you know, what he got. Because on it, it doesn't make a lot of sense when you read about his history and stuff. And where he gets to doesn't make a lot of sense. He was a mountain climber really. Right. When he was a young man. There are traverses and the Austrian Alps that Herman Goring was the first person to do that traverse of that peak. And you think about the mentality required of a mountaineer to stand at the base of a big ass rock and look up and say, I'm gonna keep going until I reach that summit. That says a lot about who Herman Goring really was and you know, who's Bavarian. Right. So from southern Germany. And once I, 'cause I didn't know he was a mountain climber. Once I knew that, then I started looking around for, well, what does that mean to be a mountain climber? You know, prior to the first World War, what kind of equipment would you have? And it's very basic, man. It's nothing, you know, you gotta, you're relying on your wits and your strength just completely. And yeah,\n\nThey didn't even have nylon ropes.\n\nProbably not.\n\nNo,\n\nNo. But not then. Right. Just all stretchy hemp. Oh Jesus, that's gonna be behave completely differently once it gets wet. But it gave me some real insight to him. But, and it also ended up giving me this great way of connecting to the other German guys who were playing the other Nazis. You know, because I just knew from the first day when they all arrived and they were sitting together in a group, I could see that they were already feeling the punishment of playing that kind of character. So I just brought them together and I asked them, 'cause now you know, these guys, some of them are German, some of them are Hungarian. And I said, look, you know, there's this song that I found and I'd like to learn the song together. And they all, you know, most of them knew the song. But that's what we would do every day as a group. We'd get together, we'd sing that song, and then we'd walk into court together feeling connected as a unit. You know?\n\nWhat kind of song was it?\n\nIt's called Mussi Den.\n\nIs it a German song?\n\nIt's a German song. And, well, I didn't realize when I first came across song, it's a Barbarian Mountain song. So he definitely knew that song. It's actually the melody that Elvis Presley uses for the song Wooden Heart in the movie Chi Blues Zoom. Stay late in Hal, stay late in Hal. You know, that's, but I don't have a wooden heart. That's what we're busy singing together. So\n\nYou guys would sing this to get into the character\n\nAnd you Wow. Be the calm. Yeah. So there's just a little thing just to remind that particular group of guys that we we're just actors we're just playing roles and you know, this will finish.\n\nThere's a lot of people that don't want to show a human side of a monster. Hmm.\n\nAnd which I think is very dangerous and quite stupid. You know, because it gives you a complete misunderstanding of what a monster is. You know, that. Yes. Okay. Here's somebody with, you know, horrific expert as the joke used to be. Even Hitler, you know, he used to love dogs. So that's the joke. Right. You know, and, and that, but there's some real truth in understanding the human process in that, that somebody who makes the absolute worst decision in the world can still be a loving father.\n\nMm.\n\nYou know, can still have a group of friends, but on, you know, a particular, in a particular moment that is the same person who's made this horrific decision that will have terrible effect on a, a generation of people.\n\nYeah. I mean it's, it's really the same kind of thing we were talking about with Tony Soprano.\n\nRight.\n\nLike that this, this person is a terrible person, but yet loves his kids. Right. Loves his friends. Yeah.\n\nWell, charm is one of the greatest weapons of evil. Yeah. You know, it's, it's a really, you know, it's a, it's a fun thing for us. We see somebody, you know, who can tell a story, tell a joke, hold a tension in a room. Yeah. You go, it's cool.",

You know, and, and that, but there's some real truth in understanding the human process in that, that somebody who makes the absolute worst decision in the world can still be a loving father.\n\nMm.\n\nYou know, can still have a group of friends, but on, you know, a particular, in a particular moment that is the same person who's made this horrific decision that will have terrible effect on a, a generation of people.\n\nYeah.

We see somebody, you know, who can tell a story, tell a joke, hold a tension in a room. Yeah. You go, it's cool. But when that process of charm goes to this other place, which becomes about life and death or the're taking away of people's rights, the dehumanizing of people as we were discussing earlier, you know, and there's, you know, I, I don't want to get into politics 'cause I have this, my, my boys have this rule. If you're gonna talk to Joe, you're not allowed to discuss politics.\n\nBecause they know once I start your boys, my, my two sons\n\nYeah's. Because my youngest boy, I think I told you, he, he became obsessed with you and, and listening to your st stuff for a while. And you became one of his sort of points of education and, you know, so that's why I started listening to you. 'cause I wanted to know what he was hearing, you know? And I go and I, I, after listening a few times, I was like, you know what man, it's cool. You know, the 'cause again, we'll use that, that word you do actually have the allowance for nuance. And that's the greatest thing about this situation. We sit down to talk, we're gonna be talking for a couple of hours. Yeah. So I don't have to reduce everything. I wanna talk to you about to make it pop in three minutes.\n\nRight. And worry about things being taken outta context in a soundbite. Right? Yeah. That this is the issue with discussing any positive attribute to a Nazi. You know what I mean? Like, you, you open up that door. Oh my God. Russell Crowe's a Nazi sympathizer.\n\nBut the people that\n\nDon't like you are just gonna take that.\n\nYeah. Yeah. And here's what Joe Rogan's discussing. Yeah,\n\nYeah, yeah. But it's, I think what you're saying is absolutely true. That it is stupid to think that way because it, because that's a human being and a very fucked up evil human being that did horrific things. But know that that is a path that people can go down even if they think they're doing the right thing. So we\n\nAre taught, for example, to regard Gaddafi in a certain way. Okay. But if you look into what happened in his country while he was the leader, you look into the fact that every person is given a house at a certain age. You look at the fact that everybody's education and healthcare is free. You look at, if somebody showed a particular talent for something that required further education overseas, all of the costs of that were paid for by the government. Now these are all things put in place by the same country's leader that we are told is evil and corrupt.\n\nYeah.\n\nSo it doesn't quite balance.\n\nWell, there's also us government interference. That's a, that's a, that is one that we definitely monkeyed with. I mean, he ran afoul of the United States government, you know,\n\nWell, what he was trying to do, as far as I understand the situation is he was trying to unite Africa and a United Africa is gonna be, it's a problem. Well, either it's gonna be fantastic. Right. It's gonna be amazing.\n\nA problem for the people that wanna run things. Yeah. Yeah. If all of a sudden there's a new Subaru\n\nPower, you've got a whole bunch of countries that, that, you know, have a connection with a certain African nation or whatever that suck their, you know, minerals out of the ground or whatever, don't pay them properly for it. Yep. You know, and and greatly benefit financially. And that's pretty much every European country's got some kind of African connection in that regard. And\n\nIncluding China.\n\nWell, China's now coming in. Yeah. Because it's able to offer a slightly better deal than they've been used to, you know? But people have to understand you. The population of Africa is enormous. Yeah. Enormous. You've got multiple countries with hundreds of millions of people.\n\nWell, when you see the continent of Africa and you see all these other countries, how many would fit inside of it? You're like, oh boy. Yeah. 'cause that's the weird thing about maps and globes is you get a distortion of the actual true\n\nSize. Well there is a distortion, right? Yeah. Whatever that's called, which shows America at the center and being physically a larger landmass than it actually is in relative terms. Oh, it's\n\nA little bit, it is the size of Australia.\n\nA hundred thousand square miles. Continental USA is a hundred thousand square miles larger than the island of Australia.\n\nThat's not much. Not\n\nMuch.\n\nThat's not much. It's not much, man. Especially when you think that you guys have 20 what? 25? 25. And we have probably 325 plus. Right. I don't think we know really how many people we have, but we have at least 320 million. Yeah, that's a lot of folks.\n\nA lot of people man. Yeah. It's a hell of a lot of people.\n\nSo we'd like to think we're a lot bigger than we are, but then you look at where we fit in Africa, you're like, oh, it's like, it's a little tiny little tiny thing.\n\nI think there's someone like 55 countries or something in Africa.\n\nI don't know. It's probably, yeah. I mean it's also Egypt. That's the other thing, you know, it's also like the most advanced civilization possibly that ever existed before today. And they were there too. It's like, it's a wild place. Like from top to bottom. It's a very, and it's the origin possibly of humankind\n\nAnd a lot more desert, I think, than, than people realize. You know, you have the Sahara and stuff, we all know that. But then there's these other gigantic areas like that. But would that be the West coast? Have you seen those roads in like Namibia or whatever where it's just, it's like a sand dune. It's 40, 50 meters high, drops down to the ocean and there's one little flat bit that there's a road. And that's possible, you know, at certain times or whatever, if the tides are not doing this and that, but that's the road. Jeez. It's like a mountain of sand and an ocean and a one little ribbon.\n\nGeez. It's, you know, United States is one of the weird things about us is that we're, we're a country that thinks mostly of ourselves and hardly ever leaves. You know, some people leave, but yeah, I bet there's a solid percentage of people that never leave the United States and maybe never even leave their city. Right. And your version of the world, you're relying on other people to give you the story of what the world is. Until you go somewhere, until you go to Thailand, until you go somewhere and you're like, wow, there's a totally different way of living out here.\n\nYeah. I've even had people, you know, come down to help me with movies or whatever, like guys that are coming down to train me and some weapon or other or whatever, and they do a lot of traveling, but it's all within the continental USA.\n\nYeah.\n\nAnd they come to Australia and they didn't realize that other people have opinions. You're not gonna find a heck of a lot of agreement to, you know, some very basic tenants. If you sit in an Australian bar, you'll find a whole bunch of people go, that's fucking stupid, mate.\n\nYeah.\n\nYou know? But look, it's still, to me it's the, the greatest country in the world is the United States of America. Absolutely greatest potentials are all here. But how it's founded on balance and fairness and opportunity, that's how it remains. Great. Not because you start taking opportunity away from people. Right. Because you are affording them opportunity. And, you know, just, it's,\n\nJust\n\nKeep that in mind, ladies and Gentlemen. Yes.\n\nBecause\n\nIt, nothing's finished, nothing's done. We're just in the process and it can all get better. For sure.\n\nYeah. And it's the rare country that is almost entirely founded by people moving here over time. Yeah.\n\nIt's all immigration.\n\nYeah. Yeah. Which is the strength. And also, you know, the, the problem with the last four years was that they were just letting anybody in and they weren't vetting people. Right. And they were inviting people in. And the problem now is they're grabbing people that are productive citizens and they're grabbing 'em and taking 'em out. 'cause they don't have the right paperwork. Yeah. So neither one is a good solution and both of them cause huge problems. Yeah. And one of the scary things. But\n\nYou do have to be aware too, though, a lot of the information that we know about that is coming to us from a motivation that we don't necessarily read. Right. They want us to think of things in negative terms. Sure.\n\nBoth sides. On both sides of the issue. Yeah. A hundred percent. Yeah. We're, we're constantly being manipulated. I had Representative Luna on the podcast and one of the things that she said that that, that I kind of knew was probably true, but I didn't wanna believe it. She was like, there's a lot of problems they never solve on purpose, so that they could campaign against them. And that's why they, they keep these things in play. That resolutions could have been reached, problems could have been solved. But these politicians are so self-serving that they don't ever want that to take place. Yeah. These people that run, these two individual parties want to keep that, that banter back and forth. They wanna keep the argument going. And\n\nYou see how absolute they are. If you know somebody with that color hat is trying to promote something, you know, the person with the other color hat. So that's absolutely ridiculous. Then it changes. An election happens. Now the person with a different colored hat, they're in charge and they're gonna put in place exactly what they said the other person was doing that was wrong. Yeah. Is now part of their policy platform.\n\nWhat is wrong with the way Australia's run? Well,\n\nWe're a little bit lucky at the moment. We have a prime minister who's very much motivated by trying to help everybody, you know, which should be the job of a politician, right? Sure. To improve the lives of the people that they represent. And he's kind of inherited, You know, a conga line of stupidity that was going on, you know, and he's trying to fix things. But of course, just the way things are reported, whatever, you know, there's, there's haters on every corner. But he's a good man and he's doing his very best and he's, you know, working extremely hard. But, you know, like he arrives off a plane the other day. He's just come back home from some very successful international meetings where he is established various trade things and, and opportunities and situations for Australia. Gets off the plane wearing a Joy Division T-shirt. Right. Big band from his youth. And he's just a relaxed character. You know, he's been wearing a suit and tie for weeks on the road. He's just walking off Australia's version of Air Force One in the Joy Division t-shirt. So the member of the opposition wanted to point out and did so in parliament that joy division is a Nazi term and comes from a section of a particular camp where the women were prostituted. And that's why it was called the Joy Division. And it's like, okay, what's the point of that? Right. We all know it's a band name. We know it's, it's a band name. Right. And just 'cause you like the Rolling Stones doesn't mean that you want rocks to be falling on people. What are you fucking talking about? You know, this whole stupidity and that's what you're facing all the time. Picking up some pointless piece of minutia and, you know, lighting it on fire and making a smokescreen to cover up the reality of the fact that that Prime Minister just worked his ass off on behalf of the country and successfully achieved a bunch of things and should be patted on the back, you know, not pushed down the stairs.\n\nYeah. Well we have a lot of that here too. That's,\n\nBut there is a timidity to a timidity I think is probably the thing in terms of how Australia is run. Things like the, the gambling ads and stuff like that. Common sense would tell you this is not a good thing to allow, you know, put the timing of these ads back so kids are asleep or whatever. Don't let them read out the odds on the news that you could fix that pretty quick. But that gambling section of the community is worth a lot of money and people in positions of power. 'cause it's not necessarily, you know, it's, it's not the guy that's gonna spend his whole wages gambling through an app that, that gets to have a say in this. You know, it's the guy whose family money allows him to run a string of 18, you know, race horses and he enjoys going to the races on the weekend. And, you know, gambling for him is not such a big deal because he's got, you know, an income from other things, blah, blah, blah. You know, so it's the wrong perspective on a problem sometimes is the actual problem.\n\nMm. And the fact that this is a fairly new thing and that young people growing up with this, there's not a history of people abusing gambling apps. Right. It's not, it's not something their parents had to deal with. It's\n\nRight. Generationally. It's not something that I can, oh, I, you know, from my experience, I can tell you this, so I had to have a, you know, when I had that conversation with my boys, it was a broader conversation about gambling and about, you know, what it takes to earn a dollar.\n\nYeah. The, I think the accessibility issue is something that people have problem with. The fact that it's on a phone versus going to a place, right. You choose to, you're gonna get your buddies together. You are gonna go play poker in a casino. Right. That's a different decision, right. Yeah.\n\nThan just sitting at home. Yeah. You know, and just constantly frittering away your money. Well\n\nThis is the thing, it's just we are, there's always some sort of point of attack. There's always an attack vector for people getting your attention or getting your money and trying to, and then we have to decide as a society, like do we, is this good to just allow, like we want freedom, but do we want to, like you can't advertise cigarettes on TV anymore. Right. They decided at one point in time, this is crazy. Cigarettes are bad for, you can advertise\n\nAlcohol,\n\nYou still can. Yeah. Yeah. Which\n\nIs weird. That's a certain time of day. Yeah.\n\nIt's weird. Yeah, it's weird. 'cause alcohol probably kills more people than cigarettes.\n\nThat funny thing that we have that was fed to us that, you know, cigarettes are this incredible burden on our health healthcare system. In reality, if you look at it, it's a burden. But, you know, there's a lot of people dying of lung cancer who've never had a cigarette. So we haven't really solved that. We don't really know where that's coming from. But in reality, the burden on our healthcare system is obesity and all the problems that come from obesity. That's the biggest. Yeah. We allow food production systems that we know to be extremely unhealthy and very bad. We just allow them to continue on. You know, we've got items of quote unquote food that have been tested and turns out there's no actual food in this. It's just, you know, a manufactured product. I think the, the famous one here was the, the Twine thing. Right? When they actually got around to looking at what was in a twine, they realized that every single part of it was completely unhealthy. Yeah.",

      "transcript_chunk": "eople than cigarettes.\n\nThat funny thing that we have that was fed to us that, you know, cigarettes are this incredible burden on our health healthcare system. In reality, if you look at it, it's a burden. But, you know, there's a lot of people dying of lung cancer who've never had a cigarette. So we haven't really solved that. We don't really know where that's coming from. But in reality, the burden on our healthcare system is obesity and all the problems that come from obesity. That's the biggest. Yeah. We allow food production systems that we know to be extremely unhealthy and very bad. We just allow them to continue on. You know, we've got items of quote unquote food that have been tested and turns out there's no actual food in this. It's just, you know, a manufactured product. I think the, the famous one here was the, the Twine thing. Right? When they actually got around to looking at what was in a twine, they realized that every single part of it was completely unhealthy. Yeah.\n\nIt's just mostly sugar, right? Yeah. Yeah. But Twinkies are delicious and I think you should be able to buy Twinkies, you know what I mean? So I, I'm on both sides of it. I'm a healthy person. I eat 99% of my food is very healthy, but I think you should be able to do whatever the fuck you want. It's just education is the most important thing. And letting people know what they're, and then teaching people some discipline and how to be able to exercise some control over yourself.\n\nSo I was 126 kilos when I finished Nuremberg.\n\nMm.\n\nI'm a hundred 0.9 right now.\n\nThat's amazing. Congratulations. Well,\n\nA lot of that.\n\nYou look great by the way. Thanks. Really do\n\nA lot of that is because you introduced me to your mate Brigham\n\nFrom Waist Towell. Yeah. Yeah.\n\nAnd so I've probably connected with them about five times since that first time we went. And the real benefit that I'm getting that I think, right, because I'm not, not completely over the science, but it seems to be with these injections that I've been getting into my shoulders, into my knees, but also IVs that it's calmed down my body's inflammation. You know, I think we talked before about just how many old injuries I carry, you know, and how like the injuries in my shoulders have a deeply arthritic, but we can now see in an ultrasound over time how, what was messy a year ago and like big thick bands of of arthritis now it's just lessened. You know, probably by about 70% on one area of my right shoulder, probably about 90%. So my range of motion, if we'd done this last year, would've been about there. Right. But now is fucking rock and roll something, you\n\nKnow what I mean? Isn't that great? It's all\n\nGoing good, you know? I know. It's amazing. And like, just feeling like the musculature starting to build and everything. I'm taking it really slowly. And that was one of the things I was worried about with Highlander because jumping into that role with the shooting date coming, it was like, man, I've gotta do, I've gotta do three workouts a day. I gotta, you know, and that for me is a bad recipe because yeah, I can, I can do that for X amount of time, but once I stop, I'm gonna stop completely. You know? And what I want to do is I wanna make all these changes and make it a long-term situation. So I think the Waste two world was a great call for me because it's calmed down a bunch of stuff. It's taken a bunch of pain away, you know, so I can go and work out and not have to suffer for two or three hours afterwards. Yeah. You know, you know, I'm still picking up injuries 'cause I've gotta face the fact I'm 61. Yeah. You know, like the other day I'm doing my cat guitar dinosaur trying to get this fricking move going on. A fricking tore the tendon here on the ulnar. Ugh. So that's gonna be bad for sword fighting, but I'm trying to fix that without having to have a, a surgical,\n\nHow bad is it torn?\n\nIt's only a little bit really, you know. Okay.\n\nYou just gotta make sure you don't overuse it while it's healing. Can you brace it? Well\n\nThe, the, the problem I've got is I've got X amount of time to claim the skill and either way, right. If I do the rehab exercises without doing surgery, if it fails, I'm now falling right on production and you know, of re torn or something. Right.\n\nBut I can help you with that. Just do this skill slowly.\n\nYeah.\n\nHere's the thing about skills. Skills that you learn slowly. You can translate into high speed quickly. Yeah. Because you develop a neural pathway. So instead of using an actual sword, use a foam sword use like one of those little fucking noodle things that people put in the pool. Use that. So you're just, just develop them. When I was teaching martial arts, one of the things that I always tell people is don't try to do it quickly when I show you something, I want you to do it slowly.\n\nThat's exactly what I did. Yeah. I'm in a car park and we were talking about the speed of something and I went, oh yeah, so you get sh and I went, oh fuck.\n\nAnd I\n\nKnew I to, but I just put my sword away and I kept the conversation going. Didn't mention it, but I got home and I was like, oh fuck.\n\nOh, you rushed, you didn't warm up. Yeah.\n\nWell the thing is we were warm, but it was a thing that I just, just in that split second, I thought, I wonder what it's like to go full speed. Oh. And I did it and I, and I just like, no way too early. But you're absolutely right. Pace is deceptive. Yeah. If you learn something, I mean, you know, that's like that old fashioned sort of stuff with with with the karate I first did when I was a kid, you know, they aim for you to do 10,000 of something before you have to use it in an actual competitive fight. You know?\n\nYeah. People who train people with guns have a saying, slow is smooth, smooth is fast.\n\nRight? Yeah.\n\nYeah. Absolutely. You want herky jerky movements and with martial arts and specifically sword fighting, it's, there's very specific movements that you're learning. And if you learn those movements slow as you speed up, you'll be going along the right pathway. And when I would teach people kicks in particular because it's a weird thing to learn how to kick something. Like you've gotta do it slowly. 'cause if you try to muscle it, you're gonna develop a bad habit that's gonna keep you from achieving full power because you want a proper technique. Yeah. And\n\nYou have to process where your balance is. Yeah. You know, what you, how you're pushing your force, but how you retain Yeah. You know, the ability to reset. Yeah.\n\nYeah. Juujitsu as well. People that learn by drilling, they get way better, way quicker by doing it flowing and doing it more easy and play like the Gracie's always say keep it playful. Yeah.\n\nLike that's, well see the thing is I know all this stuff, but I was in such a point of weariness that I was just trying to please people. Right. Oh. And so I muck myself up and you know, but I've got a bit of time now for it to heal and for me to start and actually do like, I like to do, you know,\n\nHave you visited Brigham while you're here?\n\nYeah. Yeah. I saw him missed that. Okay, great. Yeah, he's looking great.\n\nYeah, he looks great, right? Yeah. He is looking good.\n\nHe'll look you up the new, the new place. And now here's the thing. We talk about this and your listeners would probably, you know, it's expensive. No two ways about it. So it's possibly not at everybody's grasp what the sort of things that I'm doing. But I think, I'm not sure if this is absolutely right, but I think, you know, one of his sort of fervent ambitions Brigham, is to make it more available. Yes. You know, because this should be, this is cutting edge medicine. Yes. You know, if we can sort of write things in our bodies with an injection as opposed to an operation, you know, the problem I had in my left shoulder, I go and see my shoulder surgeon who fixed it while I was doing Cinderella, man. And so I did two operations with this guy, one in 2001 and the second one in 2004. But it's always had a sort of problem. And, and he did say at the time, after the second operation, that he had to cut a few corners and it would probably cause me problems later on in life. So I probably went to see him about five or six years ago and he said, okay, so you are, this shoulder is at a point of arthritis. Now what we have to do is we have to cut through the muscle bar, we have to pop out the humeral head of your arm bone. We have to shave off the top of the humal head and then we have to put a carbon fiber cap and then we have to put it back in. So everything back up, you've got about 12 months of rehab. Right. Just sounds wrong. You know, it just sounds wrong. It's like, you know, so this process that I've been going through with Brigham, basically having the effect of layering so I can now see that if the arthritis was that deep, it's now this deep, you know, it's still there. I haven't solved it yet, but I'm giving my body what it needs to make it better.\n\nAlso, there's new breakthroughs almost every week, right. And these new breakthroughs, they're, they're able to achieve the, the, they're, they're growing actual cartilage on people that were bone on bone. Right? So they're, they're developing new methods to regenerate tissue. That's the cushioning in between your, your knees and your elbows and all these things that were, and shoulders that we're requiring people to get those horrific things. Putting an artificial joint in place. 'cause everything is so arthritic.\n\nThat's one of the things that does trouble me greatly in for this country health medical systems to benefit everybody. Something has perverted here where, you know, the drug that I might need that I can buy for $50 for a month supply in Australia is two and a half thousand dollars for a month here. Yeah. Come on man. I know what's going on. It's crazy. You know, and where's, see you've got all these elected representatives here and this country's got, you know, a lot, you know, that's what you should be working on man. You know? Yeah.\n\nBut they can't\n\nBecause everybody's got their, their hands\n\n500 back. Everybodys their hands tied. Yeah. They're all got their, including the media. That's the crazy things. The amount of money they spend on advertising for the media that really just serves the purpose of now the media can't criticize the pharmaceutical drug companies. Right.\n\nWild. Yeah. Wild. It's interesting. It's because, you know, I get back here as you know, you know, my girlfriend's from New Orleans and you know, we're sitting and watching TV here and she's now seeing America from the outside. 'cause she spends most of the time traveling with me. And we don't spend that much time in, within America. You know, we live in Australia, but we've been, I've been working mainly in, in, in Europe the last few years. So she's now coming back to her country, but she's got fresh eyes and she's sitting there the other night she was watching something. She came out, she said, I've just watched like 12 ads for drugs. Right. Just one after the other, after the other, after the other. You know what, what's this tiny little problem that you might have? Or you know, if I can say it in a certain way to make you think that you've got it, bang, I got a drug for it. Bang, bang. You know? And yeah. I mean 600,000 plus people in this country in the next 12 months will go bankrupt because of their medical bills. You know how many people will go bankrupt in Australia because of their medical bills in the next 12 months?\n\nZero. Zero.\n\nYeah.\n\nYeah. It's one of the biggest problems we have. You know, and the idea that you would let that happen and not do anything about it because you're bought and paid for by these enormous companies is kind of insane. Yeah. It's insane. And they're trying, they're trying to do something about that, you know, and RFK junior's fighting an uphill battle trying to do something about that. But it's a captured industry.\n\nYeah. Yeah.\n\nAnd you know,\n\nThe\n\nFact socialized medicine, fact,\n\nProbably the fact the largest western economy is punishing its citizens in that way. Yeah. Just beggars belief. That's crazy that healthcare isn't such a principle thing. 'cause if, if, if we're not looking after ourselves and aiming for the longest life, what's the point of the human existence kind of thing. You know what I mean? So that should be a principle. Everybody's health should be a principle focus of our elected representative. Well\n\nSaid. Russell Crowe, you're the fucking man.

You know, like, I'm a creative, it's, it's my go-to default.\n\nIs the compression on something sounds weird? Yeah. Oh, it's just really loud. Something happened. Maybe my ears got better. What happened?\n\nYou can hear now. My ears aren't very good.\n\nSometimes I, you know, when I'm underwater for too long or I swim or something like that. And then I forget that my ears have water in 'em and then they come out like, oh, there's that moment where like, oh, this is how I hear. Oh,\n\nI feel like I have the in ear monitors for my job. And\n\nOh,\n\nRight. I still, like, I've been using 'em for, I don't know, 20 years and I'm still not used to 'em. Like, I come from like honky tonk world where you can hear everything. Yeah. Hear the room.\n\nWell, it's so good that people have them now. 'cause boy, so many people I know from back in the day are almost deaf.\n\nOh yeah. We, I'm so glad we have them. It's not the same. I mean it, you don't feel the energy of the room, but save your hearing, which is\n\nHelpful. It's a good trade off. Yeah, true. I mean, you can hear it enough. It's a good trade off. Yeah. And so many of my friends who shoot guns too, same thing. Yeah. You know, they started hunting when they were kids and no ear protection back then. Yeah. And you know, you, you say something to them and they're like, what? Like they're all, they're all half\n\nDeath. Yeah. My dad was a police officer and he's, I swear that's why my parents are still married because he can't hear it all. And the dog ate his hearing aid and he never replaced it. And I'm like, is that on purpose, dad? That's\n\nHilarious. That's hilarious. Yeah. You definitely develop an ability to shut things off. Yeah. Otherwise, because men and women think and communicate differently. Yeah. And if you want your wife to communicate with you the way your buddies do, then Well, you married a dude. Yeah. Okay. So if you want to be married to a woman, you have to listen. You have to like, listen and everything with both ears. And sometimes it's like round about journey to get to the point and you can't go, what the fuck are you talking about? 'cause then they're like, oh my God, why are you so hostile? So you have to go. Okay.\n\nOkay. Selective hearing.\n\nYeah, selective hearing.\n\nBut my husband will like, I'll say it and I'll be like, say it back to me. And like, and I found that when I do that, it's worse because I'm like, I'm like, say, say what I said back to you get bananas at the store. So he comes home, I'm like, where's bananas? I didn't get any. So don't repeat it. Just hold it in there.\n\nThat's hilarious. He blocked it out for himself.\n\nYeah, exactly.\n\nThat's very funny. Yeah. The the earing thing, the hearing thing is kind of nuts that no one knew. Like, it just makes you wonder, like when did people, when I wonder when people were aware that like loud music was gonna kill your hearing.\n\nI don't know. Like, just, I mean, I, I've had the in-ears for a long time and they did save all of our ears. But it's like, I think that, and then like, the longer you go, like still, even though I have those, like I turn them up way too loud. Oh, do you? Because I'm like missing. Right. The energy. And so\n\nDo you ever, you ever just say, fuck it for this\n\nShow, take one out. Like sometimes when it's like a house band, you just get to use wedges. I'm like, yes. This is amazing. What's a wedge? It's just like the little onstage monitor. Oh, right. You know what I mean? So, but it's just so loud. I mean, it's so loud. And I also do, I do mounted shooting. And so\n\nI saw that. That's crazy.\n\nAnd so it's a good reminder. Like the first time I took off on the first, I just started last year. I'm not good at all, but I love it. And I took off on my horse and I forgot to wear ear plugs. And I was like, well, I, I'm a musician. I probably plug my ears when I'm shooting a revolver off of a horse.\n\nYeah. But it's, is it a revolver using a regular bullet? No, it's black\n\nPowder.\n\nJust the powder itself. Yep. So it's just\n\nA spectator safe horse safe.\n\nSo it just sprays, sprays\n\nPowder.\n\nPowder and air\n\nAt the balloon.\n\nAnd it pops balloons. Yeah. At how, what, what distance\n\nIt could shoot, I think 15\n\nYards. Feet. Feet. Oh, okay. Yeah. So you're just riding around the horse popping balloons.\n\nI love it. I do.\n\nWhat was the origin of that sport?\n\nI don't know. Actually, one of my best friends, her name is Ken Sane, and she lives out in Scottsdale. She's like the 10 time world champion and whoa,\n\nWhoa. Hold on. We became, there's a world championship of popping balloons on a horse. Yeah.\n\nIt's called mounted shooting. And Oh, cowboy mounted shooting. But she's cowgirl and she's like, guys', girls, everybody, she's a badass. And became friends with her. And I just never had the guts to go do it, you know? And finally my husband was like, stop talking about it and go out there and do it. Go out there and shoot with her. You're gonna love it. Wow. And I got addicted immediately. It's just like something different.\n\nWell, it's very wild west, right? Oh yeah. It's essentially training how to fight with a gun on a horse. Yeah. That's all it is.\n\nExcept it's the balloon is the Yeah. Perpetrator.\n\nBut I mean it's, that's how you would train. Yeah. It's super Right. Without killing people.\n\nIt's super fun. And it's like, you know, just something that like started a new hobby at 40. Like, it's just try to like preoccupy my mind and, and I don't know, I think it inspires me to like, take a break from thinking about what I think about every single day, which is music industry, you know? So just like trying new things and saying, what the hell, let's go for it.\n\nI think that's very good for artists. I, I try to talk to comedians about that all the time. I'm like, get pick up something, man. Yeah. Like\n\nHobbies are\n\nImportant. Play golf. Go fishing. Do something. Yeah. For me, I play pool, do something. So\n\nI just started golf too. Oh, I remember. I try new things. Era. There\n\nYou go. You try new things. Era. Yes.\n\nMy, my yes. Era. Like sure, I'll do it. Started golf. Not too great yet, but I did, I just played the Ryder Cup.\n\nOh, nice.\n\nThey had like a celebrity. Hmm. Somebody heard, I played golf and I, when they heard that, I literally started like that day.\n\nJamie's a nut and I Jamie's a full on golf nut. Like\n\nHe's literally was like cramming my ass off like this September because I was on tour all summer and I didn't have time to practice. And you know how that feels like golf is, you have to practice and do you have a\n\nCoach?\n\nI had a coach, yes. No, Dan, I have a coach and he came with me as my caddy. Very helpful. But it was, it was an experience. It was a lot of pressure. Like,\n\nDid you feel it even though like, no, it didn't expect you to win. Oh my\n\nLike, yeah. I mean I just felt like, what, what, what the hell have I done when I got there? It's like, play doing something you don't do in front of people. Right. A\n\nLot of people. But you do it, you just don't do it a lot.\n\nYeah. And I don't, I do things in front of people, but it's singing.\n\nYou do things in front of people and you're really good at it. That's the difference.\n\nWell that's the thing. Doing something that you suck at in front of people is a very scary place to be. Right.\n\nRight. Jamie has OJ Simpson's golf clubs,\n\nA couple of them. Not all of 'em. I have a few. That's\n\nAwesome. How many do you have? It's not really awesome at all. Drivers? Well, I mean, they're haunted.\n\nWhatever you're into\n\nCouple. Dr. How many you got? Three.\n\nNo, I mean I got a whole, whole set. But\n\nDo you use them?\n\nI I used one of them.\n\nD is, did you hit Well?\n\nI have, that's why I used it.\n\nWhy are they blister curse? I\n\nDunno. I mean, well, he bought it as a goof, you know.\n\nYeah. It's just fun to talk about. It's a fun\n\nJoke. Just one of those things. Conversation starter. It came up. Was it, did you get 'em after he died? Yeah,\n\nYeah. Yeah. I mean, I got 'em like six months ago. Yeah.\n\nI forgot. I forget when he died\n\nA couple years ago.\n\nWell, that's cool. I mean, I,\n\nI guess, but it is really important having some kind of a thing that you do to take your mind off of the business. 'cause the people that I know where their mind is only on show business, whatever it is, music, comedy, whatever it is, they go crazy. You, you can eventually get lost in your own little world. Yeah. Like you need a little break.\n\nYou do. And I, I think it's like, you know, especially if you're like a writer, like you gotta go live to write about it or what are you writing about? Same shit you already said. Right. You know? Right. It's like I need to go live a life and gather information and be around different people and Yeah. Sort of open my circle up to just, I don't know, different experiences. Something Yeah. A different environment. Yeah.\n\nYeah. My friend Ari does that. He disappears for like three months every year and a half or so. Like, he gets rid of his phone, gets rid of his email, he\n\nLike goes off grid.\n\nOh, he goes off grid. He goes to Asia. He backpacks through Asia and he's famous. He's a famous comedian and he doesn't give a fuck. He just goes and vanishes for like, we can't find him. No one knows where he is. I don't hear from him for like three, four months. I just hope he's alive.\n\nDoes it change him?\n\nOh yeah. He comes back weird. He's weird already. He's weird as fuck. Weirder. He's weirder when he comes back. 'cause he is, you know, been living in foreign countries for, you know, a long time. Yeah. This episode is brought to you by the farmer's dog.

Right. You know, there's no room. You just, you're just doing that thing only.\n\nYeah. That's what, what, that's what I think I loved about it and got addicted to. Yeah. You know, and I guess I don't really have, I always say I don't have like an adrenaline junkie in me, but I guess I'd have to have a little bit for joining the circus like I did. You know, like Yes, you do.\n\nIt's kind of joining the circus. It's,\n\nYeah. So, but like, I think that just that little, that the focus and the little jolt Right. That you get of like, you know, the, the same kind of high we get like after a show, you know, it's like, right. I still guess I need that, but just in a different form.\n\nYeah. Joining the rodeo. Yeah. There's, there's something about shooting at things too. I do archery and there's something about shooting at things that also just really cleans your mind because in that moment, while you're pulling a trigger, there's no room for anything else. Yeah. If you're trying to hit a target, there's no room for anything else and it just, it pushes all that stuff away. Right. It gives you like a little, little mental vacation. Yeah.\n\nA hundred percent. And then\n\nYou come back like cleaner. What kind of\n\nBow are you shooting?\n\nI shoot a compound bow. Compound bow. Yeah. A Hoyt. Yeah.\n\nYeah. I used to shoot bows. I have a long time, but Oh really? I, I got 'em back out during 2020 when I had all the time in the world. And my husband's from New York City so I was like, I got these bows, I'll, I'll teach you how to shoot a bow. So we just set up the targets and got 'em all fixed stuff and it was fun. I mean it is fun. It's the same thing I think you're talking about.\n\nIt's very similar.\n\nIt's focus. It's just, even if it's just for a little while, it's that little moment in time that this is all I'm doing right now.\n\nRight. Have you ever bow hunted?\n\nI used to be a hunter. Yeah. Yeah. Yep. I did. I hunted for a long time. My dad tree\n\nStand. Yep.\n\nOkay. Or ground blind either way. Right. Bow hunting was my absolute favorite to, to do because it took the focus and it was intimate. Yeah. And it took a lot of skill and practice. Certainly bow hunting to make sure you're gonna Yeah. White tail. White tail. Oh\n\nNice.\n\nBut I raised a baby deer a buck. Aw,\n\nThat's a problem. Yep.\n\nThat's a problem. So my hunting days are behind me. Peace on my heart.\n\nWe found a buck with a broken leg on our property and my wife took to feeding it. Yeah. And all of her enthusiasm for me hunting kind of went out the window.\n\nIt changes things. Yeah.\n\nBecause it's kind of like a dog. Like they're,\n\nThey're they, he was just like a dog. Like they, they're sweet. A full grown,\n\nThey come right up to you. Yep.\n\nWild ass whitetail, deer like became like my pet.\n\nAnd it's different than any other feral animal in that they domesticate like that\n\nThey really do. Like he was literally, I'd come home and he would run over to me like a dog. So definitely changed my mind.\n\nWell I think it's because they're dumb. Unfortunately. I think nature has them set up to be not very intelligent and just food. Yeah. You know, and he's a beautiful food thing. Yeah. That's really what they are.\n\nYeah. My dad, my dad, you know, I grew up hunting with him, like taught me how to shoot a gun and all that stuff at 17. And when I raised that buck, he was like, it's over, isn't it? Yeah.\n\nIt's\n\nOver. It's over.\n\nIt's over. Yeah. I'll never raise a baby elk, I'll tell you that. Yeah.\n\nDon't do it. I don't love elk hunting too much.\n\nYeah. But I, I get it. I mean we have deer in our neighborhood and I see these little cute babies that are born every year and you know, we stop the car. Oh my God.\n\nEspecially so cute.",

      "transcript_chunk": "uld listen to stories that they would tell me about like things that they got into and they were getting into things like that. Like on a daily basis. Yeah. There was always shootouts, there was always car wrecks. There was always murders and domestic violence cases. And it's like, man, how many of those guys are just walking around with severe PTSD. Yeah. And no one cares. No one respects it.\n\nNo one's talking about it. No. Like they're just, you know, I, I think that like they don't even acknowledge it themselves. Like I know my dad worked vice in Dallas for his whole career and Woo. And back in the day like, and my and my husband like they just don't, and then they just come home and like, you know, I'd\n\nKill my hearing aids too. Like\n\nHe's like the dog ate, I guarantee you that. He just threw it away.\n\nHe fed it to put peanut butter on that fucking thing.\n\nGood job Reclaimer. We know what you did. Now he put peanut butter on it. That's just wrong. It's just wrong in so many ways.\n\nYeah man. He probably needed peace it and quiet. Yeah.\n\nHe needs mom to hush.\n\nYeah. Everybody shut the fucking world off. Yeah. You know the, one of the greatest pool players, if not the greatest pool player of all time is deaf. There's a guy named Shane Van Boning. Really? And he shuts his hearing aid off when he plays Just\n\nSo it's just silent. Yeah. Just\n\nFuck off world. Wow. And he's just in his like you people could be screaming in the crowd and he doesn't hear shit.\n\nWhat is it about pool? Like what's the, you said you play pool, you like\n\nIt. I've been playing pool for 35 years. Yeah, I've been playing forever.\n\nBut what is it about that particular,\n\nBecause the balls don't give a fuck who you are. They don't care what you think you are, they don't care who you know how much money you have. You know what you've accomplished already. How many shots you've already made. The balls don't care. The pockets are four and a quarter inches wide. And if you don't hit it perfect, it doesn't go in and it requires all of your concentration. And if you really know how to play pool, then you're dealing with like English. So you're dealing with like spin on the cue ball left and right and you're dealing with draw and follow. It's a dance of the mind in these orbs. You're hitting a ball into another ball and trying to get that thing to go straight. And it just requires this complete harmony of hand eye coordination and your spirit. Like you have to like stay calm while you're doing it. That's why\n\nGod, that's a very, that's a very good explanation of that. I'm the worst pool player of all. I mean you would think like playing as many honky tonks as I have played that I could play pool.\n\nMost\n\nPeople, it's so bad.\n\nPeople that think they could play pool can't play pool.\n\nMost people don't.\n\nIt's like, don't know really how to play pool.\n\nLike back in my day it was like just a place to flirt.\n\nYeah. It's that. It's that. The thing about pool is once you get down the road and you start to understand, you get, you really start getting the game and understanding the, and then playing in tournaments and then gambling. Then you're dealing with like real pool players. And these real pool players play pool eight hours a day.\n\nWow.\n\nEvery day you have to because you know how the thing of like being comfortable on stage or being comfortable riding a horse or being comfortable like shooting a bow or, or playing golf. Multiply that times a hundred and you have pool because pool's the only game where you take a stick and you hit a ball into another ball Every other game you hit a ball, you just hit a ball with a stick. But in pool you're hitting a ball into a ball and controlling the movement of both balls. Like the one that's hitting the ball. You're controlling how it spins off to get perfect position on the next shot. And then the other one, you wanna make sure it gets the exact right angle to go into the pocket while you're like calculating all this spin and the geometry of the table and Void collisions. It's maddening.\n\nIt's very like, I just got anxiety. It's maddening. I just got stressed out. It'll\n\nDrive you crazy. It'll, it's a game that will drive you crazy. But when you catch it, there's a thing called being in stroke and and being in dead stroke. It's a rare thing. It happens like, you know, once a month or something like that where you just can't miss where you know where everything is and it's just like calm that comes over like the world dissolves and all you feel is the table and you're completely in sync with the movement of the balls. You know how many revolutions each ball is gonna make. You feel the difference between two extra revolutions, like you know where, how hard to hit it. Exactly. And that's what everybody's chasing. They're chasing this feeling of being in dead\n\nStroke. Why does it happen happen once a month because\n\nIt's so hard to get there. You, you'd probably get, I'd probably get there all the time. If I played like a pro like eight hours a day. You probably get there once a week, but nobody stays there.\n\nBut that's probably the draw that keeps you coming back to it.\n\nYeah. Dudes do drugs just so they can get there. They get hooked on pills they get because they find that like maybe it's amphetamines, maybe it's opiates, whatever it is. Like some guys will do drugs and find that spot and then go back to drugs just to get to that spot.\n\nFrom pool. From\n\nPool. Yeah. Dang. Oh it's a nutty game.\n\nI mean I've never, it's a nutty game ever dug, dug into it like that but\n\nOh, at the highest levels. Guys are gambling from hundreds of thousands of dollars in these fucking weird places in Kentucky and weird pool hall. And they're streaming online on YouTube. They're streaming on different websites. Dang. Oh, it's at the highest level. It is a crazy game. It's a crazy game.\n\nWell I never knew that, but I learned a lot about that\n\nToday. I know a dude who's one of the best in the world and he can't travel because he needs pills. 'cause he so he can't go like overseas. He can't go anywhere. He can't travel without his pills. If he does, he won't play. Right.\n\nReally?\n\nOh, it's nuts. Yeah,\n\nIt's a head game.\n\nOh, what's that? That's it. It's, there's my friend Jeremy Jones, he won the US Open when greatest players of all time. He's like, it is the MO and he plays everything. He played baseball like at a high level. He plays golf plays. He's like, it is the most mental game really. And that's why nobody's good at it. That's why it never gets to a, it never got to a place where it was like really appreciated professionally. Right. Because you have to know how to play it to be, to understand what you're seeing. Yeah. To really see people play well, you have to know what the, what's happening.\n\nI don't, I'd never, I'm not like good at any, I've not played sports, so I'm not good at them.\n\nNo sports\n\nAt all. Well, I didn't really, I mean, I grew up kind of playing softball here and there, or so is golf.\n\nLike the\n\nFirst thing, golf is my first and my mount shooting, which is technically labeled a sport.\n\nThat's a sport for sure.\n\nSo that's like, it's new to me. Like sports are new because I just, I don't know. I started this at 17 and didn't and just was laser focused, like horse with blinders doing country music. And then what\n\nIs it like going from just being a regular high school kid and all of a sudden 17 just being thrust into a spotlight?\n\nWell, I wasn't in the spotlight at first. I was playing shit holes with no lights. But\n\nEven shithole, there's some kind light You're on stage\n\nThe pole light. Yeah. Well, well, I, I don't know. Like, I just, I don't know. I, I feel like that I, I didn't have a choice. It picked me. Like I, it's the only thing I've ever been good at. Everything is hard. It, everything else is hard to me. But like music was the only thing that I was like, I guess that's what I'm supposed to do. 'cause I'm actually good at it. Like, thank god it comes naturally\n\nFollowed it though. So many people have a thing like that and they say, oh, that's just unrealistic. I can't do that.\n\nI didn't have a backup plan that helped. There was that I, I barely graduated high school. I was like, I don't wanna waste my dad's money. That does help Going to college. I was like, I have no backup plan. So like, it really does help. The hunger that it creates is like a fire that you can't explain.\n\nYeah. You know, and it's not good advice. I would never give the advice of don't have a backup plan because some people are not gonna make it. No, you're right. And then they'll blame you. Yeah. You know, you're told me I shouldn't have a backup plan. Yeah. But I really think that for someone who's got some talent and some, a real desire to do that, and, and you can stay the course and you could deal with the hard times. Like you can't have a backup plan. You cannot, because that backup plan will rob your time. Yeah. That's the thing you have to think of. Yeah. It robs your focus. Yeah. It steals from your energy. Yeah. So it'll stop you from reaching your full potential. Fuck your backup plans.\n\nYeah. I mean, it didn't come from me. Yeah.\n\nIt came from me. Fuck your backup plan.\n\nAnd I don't wanna get blamed, but I, I just think that's like, the reason that it happened is a lot of hard work, obviously, and determination, but just nothing else. I have nothing else. Like I was terrible at school, terrible at sports. Had to get tutoring, had to like, stay late for the cheerleading dance. Like everything was just hard for me.\n\nRight. But that's just because you're a great singer. Like that's where your mind works. Like, it's just such a wonderful thing that you found the thing that you're really good at. 'cause some people, some people don't, they just don't know why they, they suck at school. They don't know why they can't pay attention. They don't know why they can't be at work on time. They don't know why. They're like, what's wrong with me? And if maybe that person just found that thing and they're like, oh my God, I'm supposed to be riding horses and shooting balloons. Exactly.\n\nHere I'm, I found me. Yeah. I think it's, I I feel like we're the lucky ones when we get to like, we know like, this is, this is what I'm supposed to do. This is what I'm gonna chase no matter what it costs. And you know, that doesn't, I see so many people that are so immensely talented that just didn't happen for, and Yeah. And you don't, and you don't know why. Like the why you said it, you don't know if it was one little factor of a period in their life or just not seen at the right time or chasing the right thing at the right time. And I don't know, I feel, I feel very thankful for that. But I'm also like trying to learn new things at 40 because I spent my whole adult life doing that. You know what I mean? Yeah. So now I'm like, what can we do next? Let's find another hobby. But that's\n\nA great approach though. Yeah. That's great. I mean, it's recognizing you want to have some more stuff in your life. That's interesting.\n\nI think that does come, I don't know. Does that come with like\n\nWisdom with age,\n\nAge wisdom and, and also feeling accomplished? Yes. I mean, I feel like I set my goals, I hit them. Yeah. You know, and that feels like, oh,\n\nThis episode is brought to you by Goldbelly. This is insane.

There's gotta be a part that, you know, you can relax a little. Like not that you know, you will, you know, when comes to like writing and singing and stuff. Yeah. But at least you don't have to worry. Like, am I gonna make it like, all right. Kind of made it like,\n\nOkay, let have some fun.\n\nYeah. And what's disappointing ma? The whole idea of making it is like your life will be better and you'll have Well your life will be better if you have more fun. Yeah. Like find some stuff you like to do.\n\nExactly. You seem like somebody that chases a lot of new things and conquers them, which I think is really inspiring.\n\nWell, I chase things that can never conquer. That's, that's the key.\n\nWell, that's like that. And no one told me that till I started playing golf and now it's too late.\n\nYeah. Well\n\nYou can't ever win.\n\nFor me, it started with martial arts. You never conquer that. You, there's always gonna be somebody better than you. Especially if you're not a professional,\n\nBut you get really, really good at the things that you're pursuing.\n\nBut it's probably mental.\n\nYou spend time on that illness.\n\nSomething wrong with me. I, I'm for sure if I was born at a different time. I was born in the sixties. They didn't really diagnose kids with a DHD when I was a kid. And\n\nOh, we both have it dope\n\n'em up a hundred percent.\n\nWe a hundred percent have it. A hundred\n\nPercent. I got it. Whatever that fuck it is. It's a superpower. It's a superpower if you use it, right? Yeah,\n\nI think so too.\n\nYeah. Just the idea that you have to medicate a kid 'cause he can't sit in school. Like find out if that kid's good at other stuff. Right. Find out if there's a thing that a hundred percent. Yeah. Okay. Maybe they can't sit there where someone's teaching them math. Maybe they get bored real quick. Maybe they start talking to her friends, whatever it is, they probably have a thing they're really good at. If they could find that thing. I bet they're focused like a motherfucker when they're playing video games. Right? Yeah. So what's that all about? You know, find the thing that that kid can lock into. A\n\nHundred percent agree. Yeah.\n\nThe thing is like, you make people do things that are completely unnatural. You make people sit down when they're six in a chair. Why? Some lady who's making $35,000 a year doesn't like kids is teaching them some shit that she doesn't care about. So there's no energy in the room. Yeah. Everything. And then when they're out in the yard with their friends are having fun and they're laughing and mad, so they're looking around, this is\n\nBullshit.\n\nThis class sucks. And they're talking to each other. And then they get in trouble for talking like, Ugh. Yeah, your child's a problem. Is the child really the problem? Seems like the child has a lot of energy. That's not a problem. Yeah. You just, you're not providing an inspiring environment for a, a growing mind. Just turning you into a, a dull drone. Some worker that just is capable of like shutting themselves off all day and then showing up and then just doing some stuff that they don't wanna do because they were taught how to do it when they were a kid. Like blah.\n\nI feel like there's a lot more opportunities now than there was.",

There's something to it. As much as I my mind want, my rational mind wants to ignore the possibility, like the randomness of the universe, the size and scope of it all. Do you really think it matters what you do you really think? But it does to you. Right. It has a giant impact on your life and everything matters. Just because there's black holes doesn't mean your fucking, your homework doesn't matter. You know, everything matters. Right. Your whole world, everything matters. It's like, you can't think that things don't matter like that. The universe wouldn't have a plan for your life when it seems to have a plan for everything. Yeah. I mean all of it seems to be happening for some sort of a very bizarre reason. Yeah. All of it together. So I'm sure that there's something to fate, but it's just my rational mind wants to go. That's just your ego. It's like silly. You could have been bored in Somalia, you know, life could have sucked for you. You know, it's, it's hard to, because fate's a weird one. Like you can't measure it, can't put it on a scale, but it seems to be real.\n\nYeah. What's real for us. Yeah. So then it's real,\n\nI guess\n\nNow also I'm like, your ceiling is giving me Yeah. I love it. The little shooting stars. Yeah. And you were like, fade is real. And it was like, boom. And I was like, yeah, it's,\n\nIf I don't tell people I didn't tell you, but sometimes people,\n\nI love it.\n\nThey're like, am I having flashbacks? Like, what's going on?\n\nIt's awesome. That's what I love about West Texas. Something about like, it's just so vast in the middle of nowhere. Mm. Like the stars are, they feel like they're, we call it the thunderdome when we're, we like lay in the yard and it just feels like they're, you could reach up and grab them because it's so dark out there. Yeah. It's magical.\n\nWell, they're on top of you and you don't have any light pollution. Yeah. Yeah. That's the thing that ruins the world. Yeah. That's the problem with New York City. That's why everybody's so stew. They're, they're like so like stuck in their own world. Just 'cause like they don't realize they're in space.\n\nExactly.\n\nYou know? Yeah. You don't get that break. Yeah.\n\nNo\n\nBreaks. This is a, a break that you get from space that I don't think you get from anything else where you just like look up and you go, oh yeah, okay. I'm taking all this shit way too seriously. Yeah. This is nuts. Like just above us.\n\nIt totally is. And I also, when you said that, it made me think of what we were talking about earlier about wisdom and like, I don't know, just kind of reaching some goals and taking a breath and calming down and going, okay, everything's okay. It's like I just feel like I saw she starting lost my train of thought. I have a DHD, I'm like, I lost my whole maybe to shut the ball.\n\nWell we were talking about space. What\n\nHappened?

Huh?\n\nWhat are, what's the loosies, why are they different?\n\nThey have like a little thing inside of 'em that you, you, they're called breakers. Okay. So what do you do? So it's like coffee flavor you put in your mouth\n\nJust like it in\n\nYeah. And you crack that little sucker open. It gives you a little blast\n\nOf flavor. A little, yeah. Little sugar. Almost like a little, yeah. Piece of cupcake. Little pizza candy\n\nIn there for You. Good. Those are fours, right? So it's not bad. Oh lord. That's a nice, I get up\n\nFour's nice if I get up and run outta here. Saw I already couldn't concentrate 'cause of the shooting.\n\nI saw a dude online. He got a a 50 milligram one from overseas. What? Yeah. And he tried it and you know, he was violently ill lying on the ground. Like\n\nA terrible, why would you do that?\n\nWell I think he did it for props, you know, like, so he could get some online cred just for the views. Did it for the gram, did it\n\nWork?\n\nI mean, I guess you it, I watched it. I wanted to, I'm like, you're gonna take a 50. Oh you're fucked dude. And he said, oh my god, it's like drinking battery acid. And then he was lying on the ground at the end of it. It was like, I really fucked up. I made a giant mistake. 'cause it's so much nicotine. 50\n\nMilligrams is crazy. But, but you're so like, so into health and just take such good care of yourself. And I What is the bit what? Like why are I just tell people, oh they're good for you have one. Well what do you think? Like tell me your opinion of these. There's this whole craze, there's\n\nNicotine is not bad for you. Correct. The delivery method is what's bad for you. And the delivery method with cigarettes in particular with cigarettes that have a bunch of chemicals added to them that's even worse. Like the regular cigarettes. Like natural cigarettes I bet are probably not as bad for you. Dr. Suzanne Humphreys, she's a, a physician who was on here was explaining to us like why regular cigarettes are not as bad, but there's still, it's still not good for you, you smoking in your lungs. But nicotine itself is not bad. Nicotine itself is neuroprotectant. Nicotine itself actually is a nootropic. So, which means it's cognitively enhancing. So nootropics are like vitamins that help brain function. And there's a bunch of 'em, like have some here we have some stuff called Alpha Brain. That's great. I've seen that. There's a bunch of companies that make different versions of a nootropic, but there are, there are nutrients that enhance memory and enhance your verbal, verbal memory. So your ability to recall words that can enhance peak alpha flow state. Like they've done like real, they've done two double-blind placebo controlled studies at the Boston Center for Memory with Alpha Brain. It shows more effectiveness than any of the drugs that they had studied over the past, like nine months before they did this. So like, this is pretty impressive. So nicotine does That too? Yeah. Nicotine enhances your memory. Enhances brain function. Enhances it, stimulates you. So there's a lot of benefits to nicotine as a, but the problem is like, how do you take it? How are you taking your nicotine? You know, probably one of the best ways is maybe gum, you know, and these, these things\n\nBecause people are wearing patches now and stuff. Oh, fucking\n\nCrazy people. That's Ron White. He wears a goddamn patch. What you doing Ron? I got a patch on it. I'm smoking. He's got a cigar. He is got a zen fucking animal. But\n\nSo good.\n\nHe's such an animal. But I think there's, there's real benefit to, I know a guy who puts a nicotine patch on for productivity when he writes.\n\nWell that makes sense to me. Like I feel like, 'cause all the songwriters are, you know, right now it's everybody in Nashville's singing and I'm like, oh, I'll try one. And it like really does give you a little\n\nStimulant.\n\nYeah. And also have a lot of words in my head. I need to remember words and I also need to write new words. You should. So anything to help with that.\n\nAnything you want. If you want help with memory. Alpha Brain's a really good one's.\n\nI wanna try that because that's a good one. I just think like at some point too, when you're tired, you know, it just, it feels like you, like you can't, I mean you just saw me lose my train of thought. It's like I don't wanna be on like a bunch of Adderall and stuff. No. I wanna be on, I wanna find a different method to like have my brain functioning. Eat the best it can. These\n\nAre addictive though. And I gotta say different people have different levels of like how addicted they get with these. Like some people can't not have them. I went on vacation, I said I'm gonna go on vacation and not bring any and see what happens. See if I freak out just to see and nothing, zero nothing. It was like I kind of missed them maybe for a day or two. Like wanted one didn't have any. And then after like three days I was like, oh, this is fine. Yeah. It's not, it's not like a physical like, oh my God I'm jonesy.\n\nIt's not like smoking.\n\nI'm a shaken. Yeah. Yeah. But I've, I know people that have tried to get off of 'em that really struggle.\n\nI mean, it, it is addictive. I mean it's nicotine. I\n\nThink the vapes are the hardest to get off of\n\nThe vapes. Like that's, I don't want heat on my voice either, you\n\nKnow? Right. That's, well, vapes aren't really hot, but it is. If you buy them ones that are like in the gas station, like who knows where those are\n\nBeing, but like, but the ones that heat up.\n\nOh yeah. The crazy ones. I like that. Adam Curry. Do you know Adam Curry is, he's the first podcaster. He used to be the MTVV. Oh yeah. Dkng. Yes. Guy with beautiful hair.\n\nYeah.\n\nYes. Good. Good friend of mine. He carries around one of those robot lunchbox vapes. Those big old crazy ones. Yeah. Where you're blowing murder\n\nAnd it makes like noise. It's\n\nLike kind of like a power bar on the side of it. So much. It's so ridiculous. And he blows this giant, but it's all like, he, he fills it with natural oil. So it's air quotes healthy. Oh, air quotes. Yeah. But\n\nThat's what they, that's what people say. They smoke American spirits.\n\nYeah. It's healthy. Come on, there's an Indian on there. Yeah,\n\nExactly.\n\nHow come they get away with that? Is, are American spirits owned by Native Americans? No. No. So how the fuck do they have a Native American on there? Not catch any slack. They do, right? Don't they have\n\nAn's a badass pack? They got in trouble in the past for stuff.\n\nSo did they? Yeah, I'm not,\n\nI'm not getting\n\nInto it. Oh. Getting into tobacco company problems.\n\nHe was like, and Pivot.\n\nDid you ever see that movie The Insider with Russell Crow? I don't think so. It's about a guy who works for a tobacco company that is explaining, he was a chemist and he was explaining how they added all these different things to make it more addictive. And they're trying to kill him in the film. 'cause they don't want that information getting out. Ooh. He's the insider. It's kind of crazy movie and based on a true story. Wow. Yeah. I watch that they, they put a bunch of shit in cigarettes to try to get you hooked. Well,\n\nAnd they do it. Yeah. I mean it works people. It does. That's the hardest one. I feel like it's, it's the most, you hear people talking about trying to quit that and drinking to me like, you know what I mean? Just on the daily. Like I'm in a band so everybody's like, oh I quit now they're all like, do you go to Zen? You got a Zen like Yeah because it's just highly addictive. I guess\n\nIt's, it is, but it's, it's people want something. They just want something to take 'em outta whatever state they're in. Gimme something. Gimme a drink, gimme this, gimme a coffee. Like everybody I know that's an Alcoholic's Anonymous. They all smoke or drink tons of coffee. It's either or both. Yes. Because they're just want to do something. Get me. Something's not gonna make me suck dick for bus fare, but I'm gonna least get a little bit of something different than regular life. I don't wanna be homeless. I don't wanna be cracked out. But yeah, gimme something. Yeah, just gimme a little something. Take me away from wherever I am right now. Yeah.\n\nNot that far away. Just a little bit away.\n\nIt's that little next door. Let me go next door and hide.\n\nI'm gonna start saying that way. I'm like, can I have his in? Can I go? I, I need to go next door.\n\nYeah, I'm gonna go next door just a little bit. I don't wanna go too far away. I could hear everybody but\n\nAm I supposed to like break this little candy thing?\n\nI do. Yeah. I break it right away. It just crack down on that little sucker. What's\n\nIn there?\n\nProbably candy. Ooh, nice. Right. That's\n\nLike a little burst of happiness.\n\nWell burst of flavor.\n\nYeah. Oh wait, next door.\n\nI like those. I like those. That's funny. My buddy Duncan found out that his blood sugar goes up when he vapes. 'cause he was buying those gas station vapes and you know he got, it's terrible. He got type two diabetes 'cause he was eating too much sugar. He's okay, don't worry. But he realized 'cause he monitors his blood glucose that like when he was vaping his blood was going through the roof. I go, okay. Why do you think that is? Like, why do you think it's strawberry flavored? What the fuck do you think's in there, bro? You're eating candy all day. Like you're vaping on sugar. Oh\n\nIt's like sugar. Yeah. Oils. Yeah. Yeah.\n\nIt has to be. Yeah it has to be. I mean if it's like grape flavored or whatever the hell it is, it's like there's some, some also, who knows what kind of oil they're putting in those damn things. It\n\nStinks\n\nPretty. It's probably made in China or somewhere. I watched a video on TikTok of these dudes testing them some. Some dude is just sucking on each one of 'em to make sure they work at the factory.\n\nWhat's gonna happen to him?\n\nI don't know what's gonna happen to you because you're sucking on the same one that he was sucking on. Nobody cleans those things off. You just get 'em at the gas station and stick it right in your mouth. That's\n\nLike a karaoke mic. Yes. That's nasty. So nasty. Okay, I'm spinning this out. Oh, to pause. Pause.\n\nOh you get rid of it. Oh.\n\nGave me, it's like a\n\nBuzz.\n\nYeah. It's like a little bit little.\n\nYeah. A little next you went next door.\n\nYeah. I like that. Yeah. Excuse me. I'm going next door.\n\nYeah. So anyway, nicotine vapes not, I don't think they're good for you folks. Sorry. 'cause people thought they were healthier for you than cigarettes. But it turns out like no, not only are they not. Yeah. Here's this look that, oh God, look he's testing all of 'em. All those cute little pink ones. He's gotta make sure they all work.",

By the way, how hooked is that guy? That guy must\n\nBe, that's awful.\n\nFucking hooked. Where is this taking place? I have no idea. Does it say in the, that guy has to test all of 'em. I would like to see like what that guy's look. That guy looks a like he's 15 years old.\n\nDid you see the bottom?\n\nNo. It says\n\nSeven to 8,000\n\nTests per day.\n\nThat's terrible,\n\nBro. Test his lungs. 'cause there's a thing called popcorn lung that kids are\n\nGetting. Yeah, I've heard of that.\n\nThe thing about these things is that they're, they're very, very addictive. They're more addictive than I think any other delivery method. Yeah. Like you just, and the thing about nicotine vapes is the first vape of the day is the only one you really want. The first vape of the day. I would take a vape and be like, this is wonderful. Like, this feeling is wonderful. It's wonderful. And then you chase that dragon and you never get it back until the next day. Yeah. The rest of the day you're sucking on this thing going,\n\nYeah,\n\nNope, nothing. And then I'm not getting it. I'm not getting that wonderful feeling. Yeah. You have to have no nicotine in your system. And then you have that one hint. It's like welcoming into your life.\n\nDo you get like, do these people get like that feeling from those patches?\n\nI don't think so. I think the patches just make you\n\nLike a little Adderall.\n\nYeah. It's like pe I'm sure people have Adderall patches, don't they? Do they have an Adderall patch? I don't think so. No. Adderall's a sketchy one. I had some in here the other day that was telling me they were doing Adderall right before I want, I did an Adderall just so I'm ready.\n\nLike it's like it's a writing. It's very helpful for writing. Oh I'm sure. It's like you don't want to have, I don't want to need it. So that's why I was, was like, what brain thing's gonna take? Yeah. What are loosies?\n\nWhat does it say? Jamie? Oh, amphetamine patch. There it is. Oh sure. Are a DHD treatment that lets you control your time your way. They always say that. Like, look, this is a, a woman who's in control. Look at her with her jean jacket on her arms crossed. I am in control. She's got a control posture. Look at her posture. I'm on a meth patch. I'm in control.\n\nA meth patch. Please Lord. No,\n\nYou are literally on a drug that will kill your superpower. You got a superpower and you're killing it with a drug. So you could\n\nFocus on I definitely don't want a patch of that.\n\nYeah, no thanks. I'm scared. No thanks. I don't need it. Hard pass. Maybe. Maybe somebody needs it. I don't wanna judge. But the reality is that stuff, the, the amphetamines in any shape or form are highly addictive. Yeah. And they're passing 'em out like candy. Yeah. My daughter's in high school and a bunch of kids in high school have air quotes. A DHD. And because of a DHD they get Adderall. And then also they get more time on tests because they got a DH, adhd. They can't focus. So they're fucking on speed\n\nTricks of the train and they get\n\nMore. Yeah. And so because it's very competitive. Yeah. Parents want to get their kids into colleges. They're, they're, you know, getting their kids diagnosed so they can get their kid hooked on whatever. They're probably already hooked on too. 'cause a lot of people that are adults are hooked on it. Yeah. And you can tell those folks 'cause they come to the, the parent teacher meetings and they can't shut the fuck up and they just wanna talk to you about everything. Oh my God. They wanna corner me and ask me about some episode. I did. Oh my god. I love that episode that you did with the kind about climate\n\nYour eyes.\n\nThey're so cracked out. They're so obviously cracked out and there's a lot of people out there just running around cracked out be, but they feel like they got it from the doctor. The doctor gave me this, I'll tell you that. 30 milligrams and I'm just a better person. I think it's better about all tasks. I I'm\n\nActually my, I like talk to that person daily. Like I feel like I, those people are everywhere. They're\n\nEverywhere. Yeah. Well we looked it up. Use perplexity, which is one of our sponsors, and find out how many prescriptions for Adderall they wrote in let's say 2024. Let's take a guess. How many\n\nDo you think? Ooh. I mean, I could not even ballpark that.\n\nI wanna say 40 million. I bet it's 40 million prescriptions at least. It's probably a lot more. But I'm going conservative and I'm saying 40 million prescriptions for Adderall in 2024. What do you want? You wanna guess? Yeah, take\n\nA guess. 40. I say 51.\n\n51. You're probably closer. I bet it's like 90. I bet it's nuts. I hope it's not. I bet it's because it's like individual people refilling prescriptions. You know, I don't think it's like 90 million patients. I be It's a lot. I bet it's all journalists. I feel like most people that are writing things this Yeah, I bet that in. What is it? Okay. How many Adderall prescriptions were written in 2024? According to Perplex? 45 million Adderall prescriptions written in the United States. Well we were both in the middle. Yeah. You what'd you go? 51. Yeah. I said 40 commonly prescribed stimulants for conditions such as a DHD and narcolepsy. This number falls several years of notable growth. Huh? It's weird. Are more people need it?\n\nIt's up since 2019.\n\nLook at that. Yeah. Notable growth data suggests the prescription rates begin to decline slightly after a, a sharp surge during the COVID-19 pandemic and shortages affected, I'll stop. Hold on. 2019 it was only 35. Interesting. So it's up 10 million. Who? That's crazy. 41.4 million in 2021 and 45 million by 2023. I bet there's a lot of people getting it illegally too. Like what's that number? Okay. Let's, that's 'cause you, there was that shortage and Right. Know if they've covered, recovered from it. Well also, once the shortage started, people got dealers. Sure.\n\nBut people are using mushrooms and stuff for that now too.\n\nThat's a very different thing though.\n\nI've heard, I've heard a lot about that.\n\nYeah. Microdosing mushrooms is a, that's a very different thing than Adderall. Yeah. That's like the opposite of Adderall.\n\nYeah. Even if it's for focus. Mm. Right. Like\n\nWell I'm sure it'll help. Your focus\n\nIs on something.\n\nYeah. But you gotta be, you gotta mine your P's and Qs when it comes to your dosages also. Like where are you getting that?\n\nThat's just scary for me. Like, I'm like, where is it from? Like, did you just go to the cow pasture? 'cause that's like what teenagers did when I heard they were doing mushrooms. Like they were like cow tipping and going, you know, from East Texas. So Yeah.\n\nWell they definitely found him growing on poop. I mean that's how all humans originally probably discovered psilocybin. They found him on cow poop. Yeah. But the thing about that though is like, you gotta get 'em from somebody who knows what they're doing. Yeah. Because there's, they're all different and you can get some that are crazy strong. Like there's some out there that'll knock you into another universe. So what are you doing? Are you just eating a cap? Are you paying attention to the, are you getting them in pill form? Who are you getting them from? Like I have a friend who,\n\nThey're all my questions too\n\nGets them from a friend. And I was like, who you who?\n\nIt's a good friend\n\nGuy. Who's the guy that you, you not seen these things get packaged, get the fuck outta here.\n\nIt's a little, little shady. Super\n\nSketch. Yep. Super sketch. Yep. And they're, they all, it's like marijuana edibles before the, the legality in California when it was medical they'd be, it was crazy because now they, they, because of the regulations in California, I think the most they could make 'em is 10 milligrams. Which is normal. Yeah. It's a normal dose. But before that, when it was medical, like it became medical in the nineties, they would make 500 milligram Chiba. These, these things that like they're 500 milligrams, which is insane. It puts you in another dimension\n\nThat's, I never even heard of that.\n\nThey're so strong. And my friend Joey, who's a real demon, Joey used to take the wrapper off of 25 milligram ones and give people a 500 milligram one instead.\n\nOh. He throw a, a real demon\n\nAnd he would just laugh because he can, he could tolerate insane doses. So he would give people like preposterous amounts.\n\nI have a songwriter friend and I love her dearly, but whatever she says, do this. I'm like, do a quarter of that, whatever that is to the public. Do yourself a surface. Do a quarter of that.\n\nSome people have ridiculous tolerances\n\nFor marijuana. Yeah. I mean it's crazy. Yeah.\n\nFor anything.\n\nI'm just over here taking a Lucy from a random dude.\n\nWell it's only four milligrams. I'm kidding. It's minor. It wasn't that bad. Right. I would never like the nine. I would've told you like, spit that quick.\n\nThat's\n\nA lot. Real quick. It's a lot. Yeah, it's a lot. I have twelves.\n\nWhat do you do? You use those for real busy days?\n\nI don't like 'em. They, they jolt me too much. But I have them. This is just 'cause Lucy sent them to me, but I think the right dose is three or four. That's right. You guys just a little pick me up just a little.\n\nNot the cracked out. Not the cracked out. Cracked soccer\n\nMom crack. Yeah. Not the cracked out. Not add. I've never tried Adderall. I've, I'm scared of it. I want to try it one day because I'm scared of it. 'cause I'm like, I need to know what everybody's fussing about because everybody I know that's tried it is like, don't try it. You'll love it.\n\nYou'll love it. You'll fucking love it. It is focus. Yeah. I mean it is, it really hones hones in. I have a\n\nBuddy of mine and his wife told him to stop 'cause he was snorting it 'cause he was writing. That's\n\nInsane.\n\nHe is like, that's the best way to get it real quick. He, and he was like, to his wife, he was like, why do you care how I do it? She's like, you are snorting drugs while the kids are asleep. He's like, okay.\n\nYeah, it's a little far, dude. Slow your roll.\n\nHe's not an addict though. He just, he just felt like he's\n\nNot an addict though. He's not an addict.\n\nHe felt like he had to snort to really get the most outta it, it quickly.\n\nWell everybody, like you said, everybody's trying to find something like,\n\nBecause I think if you take it as a pill, it probably takes like an hour before it kicks in and he didn't have an hour. So he is like,\n\nI have a deadline. Yeah. Does your friend that disappears, does he like, have he doesn't have phone, no digital. Nothing. No. Nothing.\n\nNo.\n\nI wonder if that digital detox is like one of the hardest ones. I feel like\n\nIt's gotta be the hardest. Yeah. I've done social media detoxes for multiple days and you genuinely feel better. Yeah. And then you go, why am I doing this to myself? Or I don't do this.\n\nI know all the time. Something that's annoying. If I can just say it is that like, when people do take a break from social media, that's like all they tell you about the whole time. Well, I'm on a break from social media. I'm like, yes. Can you be on a break with broke without telling anybody that you're on a break from social media. Right.\n\nThey have to tell you how virtuous they are. God, I am actually gonna break of social media unlike you. I'm\n\nLike, cool bro.\n\nYou you little addict scrolling through cat videos.\n\nDoom scrolling.\n\nYeah. There's a lot of doom scrolling. Yeah. It's like people who do yoga, they can't shut the fuck up about it.\n\nYeah. It's like a lot of things. Or people with like a special, a special like a special diet. Like oh yeah, carnivore. Oh, you're hearing about it. Carnivore. You're hearing about it.\n\nVegans are the worst.\n\nYou're gonna hear about it. They're the absolute worst. Like,\n\nLike no one has ever met a vegan that didn't tell them they're vegan. It doesn't happen. They\n\nAlways tell you never. Not like that. They working\n\nInto a conversation eventually. This episode is brought to you by Activision. You know me, I love a bit of action. That's why I'm excited to announce that Call of Duty, black Ops seven is coming soon.

      "transcript_chunk": ". That's a drone. They're\n\nSo\n\nBad. Put in my yard by China.\n\nMy husband is probably dying out there that I even brought this. He's like, are you talking my soup? Our chicken. So I'm just being there. He's like cooking and I'm just like, I'm painting my chickens right now. Always\n\nChickens.\n\nI don't know why. I have no idea. It's easy. That's why. Fate. It's\n\nFate. You're designed to be the greatest folk. Art chicken.\n\nThat's my next song. Folk art. Fake painter\n\nOf all time. Folk art fate. Imagine if that's what it is. Like there's something that compelling. You tell the world about chicken folk art.\n\nI guess. So. Here\n\nWe go. You watch chick. Do you have chickens?\n\nYeah, I do have chickens. I have\n\nChickens.\n\nI love chickens.\n\nChickens are great.\n\nRight? They're awesome.\n\nThey're really cute. They're the ladies. I go in the yard like, hi\n\nLadies. The ladies. That's why I call 'em. I say, Hey ladies, I give them all the scraps. They love everything from the table. Like any leftovers. It's funny to watch 'em though 'cause they're like picky. Like the other day I thought they would eat like leftover breakfast. Casserole wouldn't touch it really? But they were all, they didn't eat the biscuits. Chickens don't like biscuits.\n\nWell, maybe they know that breakfast casserole is eggs and they're like, Jesus Christ, this lady's fucking nuts. She's trying to turned us into cannibals.\n\nRidiculous. Because I didn't think about that.\n\nRight. Maybe it's like,\n\nOh no, what have I done to my ladies?\n\nIt might be like a natural reaction to them. I'll tell you what they go crazy for is mice. Have you ever seen what, oh yeah. Yeah. So this is how I found out. I used to have a house in California that my wife, she changed our back fence. It was a wrought iron fence. And she changed it to glass. And when she did, she, she signed a death warrant for a bunch of hawks. And they kept slamming into that fucking glass. And like three of them died in our yard. And one of them got kd but survived. And I was on the road and she had told me about it. And they'd taken this, this hawk and they had put it in a box. And when I got back we got 'em what's called pinkies. And what pinkies are, are these little baby mice that have, they feed 'em to lizards and snakes. Like that's what they're for. Like when you go to the pet store, they sell you these things. They're not weaned from their mother. And you feed 'em the snakes. I know it's dark. So they, they bought a bunch of 'em and fed this hawk, these little baby mice. And it ate all of them except one. And my daughters were very young at the time and they're like, we wanna keep that mouse. We wanna raise it. I'm like, honey, you can't, it's not gonna live. Like it's not weaned from its mother. It won't survive. I go, I'm just gonna go see if the chickens will eat it. I put this thing down and these chickens attacked like they were raptors from Jurassic Park. One chicken grabbed it and they all chased her around. They were\n\nStealing it from what in the world are you saying?\n\nPulling it out of her mouth? It is the, they are so ferocious. Like you've never seen anything like a chicken with a mouse.\n\nI have never heard this in my life.\n\nI'm gonna show you a video. And this video, oh, do I wanna see this? There's a bunch of videos of cats with mice. So, so this is a mouse. And why, why do these chickens? My god. They just kill this mouse. And look, they all attack each other trying to steal the mouse away from the one chicken. And has it, do they eat? Oh, they eat it quick. Yeah, they devour it. Hmm. So there's another mouse in there that they don't know about yet. So see there's one with a cat. So the cat is playing with the, the mouse. Like, you know, cats don't kill it or an they wanna play. And this chicken just runs over and snatches it from the cat. Like,\n\nFuck you. I have never heard this in my life. So\n\nLook, the cat has a mouse and chicken's like, gimme that bitch. They just go, look, it's got a mouse. And the cat's like, Jesus Christ, you guys are psychos.\n\nWell, who knew? Yeah.\n\nWell because they're dinosaurs. That's who they are. They're just dinosaurs that are really small that survive the impact of the asteroid.\n\nI also love dinosaurs, so maybe that's why. That's it. Chickens. I'm called to paint my folk chicken.\n\nYou just don't realize how ruthless they are until\n\nYou see, I've never heard this in my life. This is blowing 'em. I'm country as a bump. And like I've never heard this. They\n\nDestroy mice. Yeah. Dang. Destroy 'em. They love 'em. They tear 'em apart.\n\nWell, I'm not gonna go do that, but I'm glad I know that now.\n\nLike nothing I've ever seen before. We also saw a mouse that got loose in the chicken coop once they, we had a big chicken coop and a mouse went in there and I saw these chickens just tear that mouse\n\nUp. Well the ma casserole is not offensive to them\n\nEating their own babies.\n\nThey're not, we don't have a rooster.\n\nWell I know, but they don't know that you're right. You know, they brooded sometimes\n\nI think baby know. I just let 'em sometimes. And I'm like, do you? Well I just like, sometimes they look at me like, let me just sit on this. Like, like, okay, you can have it. That's your egg out.\n\nYeah. But they pluck their feathers out.\n\nI know. They, it's a lot.\n\nThey get real. They get real. It, it makes you sad. It's like they wanna be a mommy. They do. Yeah. And you don't let 'em, we had a rooster once, but he did not last.\n\nI do not enjoy having roosters. They're roosters soul\n\nFuckers. They're me. Yeah. He attacked my wife and she's like, we're done. Me\n\nToo. Mine attack me. I'm out on rooster.\n\nYeah, they're they're assholes. Yeah. And but they're doing it because they're trying to protect their hens. Like they don't know that you're okay. No, they just think this big fucking thing is moving around their hens. Like this giant person\n\nThing. They're also mean to the hint. Real mean. They're they're mean brutal. Ripping their feathers out. I'm like, I can't do it.\n\nYeah. They're nasty. They're,\n\nHow many do y'all have? Chickens?\n\nWe have 15. 15 or\n\n16. Y'all name 'em.\n\nYes. I don't name 'em, but my daughter girls and my wife names them. But the rooster, he, we only let him got, he got to maturity and then we gave him to a friend. We're like, this motherfucker can't, no, I was gonna kill him. They're mean.\n\nYeah.\n\nHe attacked me. I went into the, I was like, you just gotta like, show him who's boss. And he is like, no, no, you're not boss. I'll attack you too, bitch. Yeah, exactly. He attacked me and I was like, bitch, like it. I'll fucking kill you. And so to avoid killing him, I gave him away. Well that's good because I was totally ready to kill him. Yeah. Because when I'd go in there, he'd face off against me and just leap at me and\n\nAt\n\nMe. Every\n\nYeah. Might, might attack me too. And dad dealt with it. I don't know what happened to him, but dad dealt with it.\n\nSoup. Turned with the soup. Yeah. That's the thing about roosters too. I guess he can't like just outright eat 'em. They're really tough. So if you do kill 'em, you gotta like, either slow cook 'em or turn 'em into soup.\n\nWell we, we probably did. He didn't tell me\n\nI had a landscaper back when I lived in LA who he used to fight chickens and he took me over his place once.\n\nI hate that.\n\nIt was crazy.\n\nI hate it. Yeah.\n\nHe had like a hundred, a hundred roosters.\n\nWe have done some boxers my nation has done. We're not just, we don't just help dogs. We help all animals. But dogs are focused. But like we've helped break up some chicken rings the past. It's\n\nKind of the crazy that it's still, it's still around.\n\nIt's awful. There's some, it's always out. Like we have a farm in Tennessee and there's a whole, this is whole farm like down the road and it's, they keep him in tiny cages. I just hate it. And every time we report him, every time they just pay the fine. You know what I mean?\n\nWell, it's a part of the culture that's the problem. And they all gamble on it. I know he was Mexican and you know, from Mexico and he had all these friends that lived in this neighborhood where he lived in like, you might as well have been in Mexico. It was crazy. Everything was in Spanish. And when I went over his place, it's like his buddy, we went over his buddy's place. His buddy had like a hundred cages in the backyard in a pit where they would take the roosters. Awful. Yeah. And they put spurs on 'em. So they put\n\nThese like, it's so terrible. I mean, knives\n\nOn their claws.\n\nWe, we try to like, we got to be part of like some of the But when you confiscate like that many they use mean Yeah. I mean you can't Yeah. And reintroduce them into the world. Like Right. You know what I mean? They're taught to be mean. They're bred for that.\n\nYeah. And they'll br they'll breed champion roosters from champion other roosters.\n\nLet's just stick to our little backyard hens. How about that?\n\nYeah. It's just, it's a weird thing because like their, their culture has been, they fight them and then they take the loser and they cook 'em. Yeah. And you know, he was making it seem like it was no big deal. And it was like, to them it was their gambling recreation. Yeah. They would all gather around and guys would come from long distances to bring their chickens to fight.\n\nI hate it.\n\nYeah. To me it doesn't freak me out as much as dog fighting. Dog fighting drives me nuts. 'cause pit bulls are the, they're look, they're very dangerous because they have a very high parade drive and they often don't, they confuse children with other animals. They don't. But as pets, they are the most loyal. They're just, they're the most\n\nLoving,\n\nThey're sweetest\n\nKind.\n\nThey love you to death. They love you so much. But there's so many bad ones and so many ones that are raised just to fight. And that part of our culture, that part of society, like the the underground dog fighting part is like, how can you do that to a dog? Like how can you do that to the best animals? Yeah. It's the scum\n\nOf the earth is what it is. I feel like I have some friends that are huge into pit bull rescue and when they're either rehabilitated or just they get a bad rap period. Right. Like, like say any, any metro shelter you go to, it's 90% pit bulls because people are afraid. Yeah. But they're, they get such a bad reputation. But there are some amazing pities that weren't ever in the fighting greens. Right. They were just overbred and you know, you know, taking it out of a confiscation of a, of a hoarding situation or breaking up the fighting rings and it's the mama dog that's just been having puppies and like Yeah. I just wish people would at least open their minds and hearts to like, there are some amazing pities out there or pity mixes. You know, there\n\nAre, but there are also very dangerous. I\n\nGet it. I know they are. They\n\nGo around other dogs. They will fight those dogs to the death.\n\nI think you're, that's the problem. They have to be vetted. It has to be a well vetted shelter or adoption. You know.\n\nBut the problem is oftentimes you don't know their behavior until they're around other dogs. Yeah. Like I've had dogs that were great around people. Yeah. And I get them around any dog and their hackles would go up and they immediately wanted to fight. Yeah. And you're like, oh god. And then you're the asshole. 'cause your dog is like pulling on the leash and you're like, I'm sorry. Let me get 'em outta here.\n\nRight. I know.\n\nThey, they're dangerous. They're dangerous in that regard because they really are bred to fight. And\n\nI think it takes a special household and owner too to really Yes. Kind of handle a dog like that. Like\n\n100%.\n\nOur best friends, Gwen, she's in my band and her and her husband are long time pit bull rescue family. And he, they just know how to like deal with them and they come around our dogs, they're fine, everything's fine. But it's definitely an alpha male out. Like they kind of show 'em who boss right away and Yeah. And they sort of understand the food chain of the house. You know what I mean?\n\nYeah. There's dogs that are great dogs, but they just need a lot of attention. Like if you have a German shepherd Yeah. Or a Belgium malis, you gotta give those things something to do.\n\nYeah. You gotta know what kind of breed you're getting too. Yeah. Like I feel like people, I always preach, adopt, don't shop. But I still think you within the adoption, like really need to go, I'm gonna spend some time with this dog. I'm gonna talk to his foster family. I'm gonna foster it. Just to really understand what kind of breed you're getting. If you want like a lazy, cuddly thing, but still protect or kid a Pyrenees. You know what I mean? Right. Just know what you're getting. Like just understand like as my household ready. 'cause there's a lot of the, what breaks my heart the most is the like owner surrenders and the returns Yeah. At the shelters. You know what I mean? It's like Yeah. You didn't think through what you were right doing and\n\nThen the dog already thought it had a home and now\n\nYou bring 'em in. Right. Because you did. You wanted a lazy dog and you got a cow dog and it needs to run like\n\nGreat. Pyrenees are great because they're kind of a combination of like a lab and a protector dog. Yes. They're a great little balance. Yeah. Like I have a friend who has a Pyrenees and it's like such a good dog. And he's like, listen man, if coyotes come around here, this fucking dog. Oh\n\nYeah. We're not, we're\n\nNot fo them up. Yep. I go, really? And he goes like, oh yeah. Like you, you ain't never seen a change of personality like this dog when it sees a coyote,\n\nBut then they're like laid up on the couch, the legs in air. Oh, the\n\nSweetest. Just rub my bat under your knee.\n\nHe is the best.\n\nLike a re like I have a golden who's he's the best. Unless you're a squirrel. And then he's, he's hell\n\nThen he's\n\nHe then he is a demon. Yep. Exactly. He's, he's squirrel killer. But other than that he's the sweetest boy. He's just so nice to everybody. Everybody who comes over the house, like you're my best friend.\n\nGoldens are the best.\n\nThey're so sweet.\n\nBut I love 'em all. I love 'em all. We have a chihuahua. I mean, I, I mean you, you getting a chihuahua, you know what you're getting. Yeah. Mean as hell\n\nAnd nervous.\n\nOh my God. I mean she's 16 and blind and she still tries to bite. She don't know where you are. But she's like, but I could get you,\n\n16 is old\n\nAnd blind is a bat. But\n\nYou know. Oh my god.\n\nSenior dog house over here.\n\nHave you had her since she was a baby? Yep.\n\nWow. We doctor her from a shelter when she was like eight weeks old. Aw. We got two seniors now. But seniors I've lost. I was crazy dog lady when my husband met me and I had eight rescues, like wow. It seems crazy now. But it, I have farm and land and three were Pyrenees, two golden mixes and then three little, I don't know what's, and I've lost one every year for six years. And so after this, we have two seniors left. And my husband's like, my heart can't take this. Like he never had dogs growing up. Oh, he loves dogs. But he was like, this is awful. Like ever since we met, we've lost one. 'cause they're stair step in age and Yeah. So I'm like, I need a, my heart needs a break a little bit. It's hard.\n\nYeah. It's hard when they die. It's like, it's, it's so hard. So close to them. And they only lived like to\n\nBe 15, not long enough.\n\n15 or 13. And then it's over.\n\nThey're like, put here to show us true love. I know. They really are.\n\nMeanwhile they're not, meanwhile what they are is like, that's wild. I'm in, we took wolves and turned them into bitches. That's what really, really what happened. Like I have a King Charles spaniel. You know one of those. He's the sweetest. That's my little\n\nCharlie. Is that Charlie? Okay. That's\n\nCharlie. Charlie. He is the sweetest. He's so cute. You pick him up, he just kisses your face. He's just so adorable. That was a wolf at one time.",

It eviscerated this calve and it, it was still alive and it had eaten some of its organs and they had to kill the calve. And then they're like hunting for this mountain lion and he has a video of him shooting this thing. Dogs chase it up a tree and then he shoots it with a bow and arrow. And then he had it stuffed here and he ate it.\n\nDo you aim, you aim for the heart or the head?\n\nYeah. You aim for the heart and the lungs, whatever is available depending on the position of the mountain lion's arm. Right. Like if the arm is like right here, you wanna, you want to tuck it right behind the shoulder and you're gonna get double lungs. And if the arm is up here, you gonna either get the heart or the lungs depending on where their arm is or whether or not you have a, but that's powerful enough to go through the arm and into the body cavity.\n\nIs there a risk, 'cause maybe this is like an urban myth, but if you hurt, hurt an animal, but you don't kill it, it will come back. Some of them will come back to fuck you up like a kind of revenge movie. No,\n\nJohn Wick of animals.\n\nYeah. I imagine they just run away. They\n\nRun away. Well, it's wild like deer that have survived with an arrow in their body cavity. There was a, a deer skeleton that they found of a deer that they, that someone a hunter killed eventually. And this thing had a arrow that had gone through its body and had turned all into bone. So bone had taken over this arrow and the, the whole ca, there it is. That's what it looked like. Wow.\n\nWow.\n\nIsn't that crazy? Mm. So you could see the broadhead had embedded itself in one of the ribs. And so not only did the deer survive, but its body adapted and grew around the arrow.\n\nWow. Wow. Actually, the reason I said that about the nuts. That is insane about the animal was I know that COVID, particularly crows can remember. They can remember. Oh yeah. And then there's been instances where people have hurt crows and the crows phone away. And then a group of them have attacked the person.\n\nOh yeah. They're really smart. They're, they're super and ravens, I think that are, they're actually different than crows. And they're even smarter than crows. Do you know there's a parrot Who was that parrot? That brave parrot? Yeah. Who told us about that? Who was that the other day? Was that Palmer? Palmer Lucky? I think so. I think\n\nSo. Oh, is that the dude with the helmet? Yes. Holy shit. That helmet, bro.\n\nBro, that helmet's nuts. That helmet's nuts. This guy, that guy was, every now and then I get to sit down with someone and they start talking. I go, whoa, he, this guy's fucking crazy smart. Like weirdly smart. Like, oh, okay, I got it. I got it. Like, tell me what you're doing. And he was telling us about this parrot that actually would speak like a human toddler and new colors, new numbers. Could say things could and would communicate\n\nAfrican gray. Yeah, yeah. Yeah. African grays. They have a, they, they can have the IQ of a 4-year-old child. That\n\nIs nuts. Yeah. When you see this thing talking, you're like, yeah.\n\nAnd their imitation of sounds is like\n\nPerfect. Dead\n\nOn. Yeah. Dead on. Yeah.\n\nBut you have to be around them all the time.\n\nRight, right, right. You\n\nHave a twin that you gotta take with you everywhere you go. Yeah.\n\nReally? Because they just get pulled and fuck, fuck. You can fuck shit up.\n\nAnd then they, they're too smart. They actually start like chopping their own wings off and shit like that. Yeah. They get depressed because they don get stimulation depress, they get depressed. They really need a lot of stimulation. Really? Yeah. They're like humans. I thought about owning app para, but I just traveled too much. Yeah. You\n\nDon't know. You don't want that in your life. That's too much work.\n\nIt's, it's a commitment. Yeah. If\n\nYou leave it alone, it would be sad too. Yeah.\n\nBut that's what I'm saying. Yeah. They\n\nGet mad. I had a buddy of mine who had a parrot and when he would leave it, he would come home and start screaming, where the fuck were you? Like, he wasn't really saying that, but it was like, that was what it was saying. Yeah. It was, was screaming.\n\nWhy get married when you've got that? Right.\n\nYeah. And then he had to, upon coming home, immediately take it out and take it out and like put it on his shoulder. Right. Or put it in his hand. And if you put it down for a second it would start getting pissed off. It's crazy. I'm like, dude, he goes, I know it's a lot. He goes, I didn't think it was gonna be this much. It was like, it was a lot of work. Yeah.\n\nJoe, I'm not, hope I'm not being polite. Have you got any of those cigars where all we smoke? I would love a cigar.\n\nLet's go baby.\n\nIt's a weird thing to ask to be. These are really good. I should have said, if you offer us a cigar, we'll accept one. Come on man.\n\nPlease. Thanks, brother. We have a big ass humid door. There is a, oh, I\n\nDidn't bring my light out\n\nOver there. Some here. Right here.\n\nOh, bonobo chimps are very interesting like that as well.\n\nThey're the weirdest, right? Because they just fuck all the time. This might, might need some juice. Let me give you a little juice.\n\nGo\n\nFor it. They're weird because it's like, okay, so chimps can be either hippies or they can be, you know, like the worst barbarians in human history. Well, it's\n\nLike us.\n\nJust like us. Yeah. That's what's weird. 'cause like, but also the bonobos, like they don't have any, they have one rule. The rule is the mom won't fuck the son. That's it. It's\n\nA good rule. So yeah. It's a good fucking rule man. But they're a\n\nBunch of sister fuckers. They're a bunch of sister fuckers and daughter fuckers. Yeah.\n\nBut they're not motherfuckers. They're\n\nProbably dad fuckers too. They're probably fucking, they're probably doing gay sex too. They, they, they seem wild. They're just having a good time. But\n\nThey, so they're homophobic.\n\nNo, not at all. And they solve all their problems with that. Do\n\nYou need to cut these ones? Yeah. How do\n\nYou It opens like a door.\n\nOh, alright.\n\nRight here. And then you pull those.\n\nBut you know they can learn sign language. Oh yeah.\n\nYou know what's interesting though? They don't ask questions.\n\nSo they're like men. Ah.\n\nBut the parrot did.\n\nThe parrot did. Yeah.\n\nThe parrot asked questions. The parrot had some questions about how things work.\n\nThe African grays are incredibly intelligent. Yeah. Incredibly intelligent.\n\nWell, what I'm interested in is what happens when we can start really decoding dolphin language with ai. Right. And once they really understand what they're saying, then things are gonna get very strange.\n\nLight it. And\n\nYou know, because like, what are they, did they, I mean they're really smart, like silly smart. Like dolphins have enormous frontal lobes.\n\nOh yeah. Man. And communication. They\n\nHave dialects. They have,\n\nThey have dialects. Yeah.\n\nThey sound different. Different\n\nParts of the world. That makes sense. I mean that makes sense. Right? The different, slightly different.\n\nWell, on that note, you think, what about whales? Yeah. Whales brains are literally bigger than us. Yeah. They're, they're enormous. So if we're talking about brain size equals I, which I'm\n\nIt's brain size relative to body master. Yeah.\n\nOh is it? Yeah.\n\nYeah. Because you need a big fucking brain to run a big body. Yeah. Right,\n\nRight. Which is also the argument for why the Neanderthals might have been dumber than us.\n\nWell they were from\n\nWhat we think. They don't know that though. Really? Yeah. They had pretty big brains. What's weird about them is they also had language. Yeah. They had writing and or they had, they definitely had tool making. They had\n\nWriting Don't, I don't think they had\n\nWriting. Writing. No, they didn't have writing. They had language. But they, they did do art. That's what it is. Mm. Wasn't writing necessarily, but they drew stuff and they had a brain that's bigger than ours. But they were also like jacked. They had bigger eyeballs. There was a guy that, this was a, there was a crazy theory that I'm sure is horseshit, but it was cool. Like he made Neanderthals look way different. This guy had a theory like, 'cause we're just, we've never seen a live neanderthal. And he was like, what if we are getting it totally wrong? And what if they were more gorilla looking\n\nThan, but we have the skulls and skeletons down\n\nThere. We have some stuff and they also think they have red hair. This guy was, it's a cracked theory. Right, right. But it was a fun theory. But one of the more fun aspects of this guy's crack theory was that their eyeballs are so much bigger than ours. Their sockets are really big. He's like, what if they have night vision like a deer or like a wolf, you know? Which is totally possible for a primate to have. It's not like, it's not like there's anything about being that kind of a mammal that would exclude you from being able to develop night vision eyesight. Are\n\nThere, are there primates that have that?\n\nI don't\n\nKnow because there's mammals for sure. Yeah.\n\nBut what, yeah, let's ask, let's ask perplexity. Perplexity.\n\nIs\n\nThere any, what is that called? When they have night vision when animals are nocturnal and they could see well at night, you know that thing that like when you're driving and you're see\n\nA fox or something? Yeah,\n\nYeah, yeah. The reflective eyes that they all have. Yeah.\n\nYeah. What is that? I don't, what's\n\nThat called? I dunno. I dunno.\n\nWe should know.\n\nDo you know there's a very interesting theory about ne neanderthals and homo sapiens is there are some people who think that we are one of the few species or one of the only species that has a capacity to deceive Oh and trick. So there was, there's a, there's a theory going around that, that\n\nThe monkeys do that monkeys trick other monkeys into thinking there's an eagle coming. So they steal fruit. Do\n\nThey? Yeah. That's interesting.\n\nThey yell out the sound for eagle and then all the monkeys run away and then they steal the fruit.\n\nOh really? Yeah. Wow.\n\nSo here it is. Monkey primates, the tarsier and the night monkey al monkey are the species with the best vision adapted to night conditions. Right. Okay. So they do. Yeah. See, look at that largest eyes relative to body size of any mammal. So it's something about having a large eye. Because if you, okay. So despite lacking a tape, ofum lucidum, the reflective layer that cause eye shine in many nocturnal animals. Oh, that's what that is. The retina is containing extremely high density of rod photoreceptors, which are highly sensitive to dim light. This allows tarsiers to detect and track prey such as insects in near darkness. And they can see in light as low as 0.001 lux. Similar to moonless nights. Damn. So there's a bunch of different little primates. Oh,\n\nLori's.\n\nBut why, I mean, if you were living in a time, especially if you didn't have fire, if you're living in a time where, you know, there's no roofs, like you're, you're, you're hunting, you're outside at night, you're probably spending as much time as you can hunting. 'cause Neanderthals weren't gatherers, they weren't farmers. So all they did was hunt. Mm. So they probably had some sort of night vision, which would've wild.\n\nYeah. The thing that I find interesting is what is there, I think there's certain, the average person in Europe has around 3% Neanderthal,\n\nDNAD,\n\nNAD three, 3% a if you are African zero. Right. So it's, it's just really interesting. And you see some people, and they're more, they kind of have more than neanderthal kind of appearance too.\n\nYeah, for sure.\n\nAnd then other people. And you go, what, what does that actually give you that 3%? What does it do? Is there any discernible difference whatsoever? Does it make you perhaps more athletic, more re more resilient?\n\nIt's a good question. I mean, I think it would depend. I mean there's also a bunch of other weird strains of human that existed that there, you know, like Dennis Ovs and there's, there's quite a few other ones. Yeah,\n\nYeah.\n\nYeah. You know, who knows what if, I think the Dennis Ovs, I think they definitely got into the gene pool too. I forget who they were saying had a high levels of Dennis Ov DNA, it might have been aboriginal Australians. Hmm. But you know, there's, there was a bunch of different types of human, you know, we just figured out how to be the kiest and the most conniving. And I think probably the most clever,\n\nWell, harra, have you read the Sapiens? His thesis is we, we worked out how to work together beyond the 150 done by number. That was his, his idea is basically we created these shared myths. Religion, money, whatever nation, all of the stuff that we all agree is real that, you know, it feels real. Right. But we, the reason we out-competed other species is that we could cooperate across beyond our immediate tribal group. And that's the reason. That\n\nMakes sense. That makes sense. I mean, there's also, human beings have a very distinct desire to make better things all the time. And if you have that and you're applying that to weapons, you're gonna make the best weapons. Right. You know, I don't know if Neanderthals had that. You know, did they have, I mean, if you're gonna make stuff, right? If you're gonna make tools, you must have some creativity and some desire to innovate. And\n\nCuriosity.\n\nYeah. Curiosity, desire to innovate. 'cause we know that, look, there's certain animals that will use weapons. Right. There's certain, like there's a, a famous photograph of an orangutan that's spearfishing. Have you ever seen that? Yeah. Photo. Mm. But it learned how to do it from people and you know, they'll use rocks to break open crabs and they'll do stuff like that. But they're not fastening an arrowhead No. On a stick or a spear. And they're making it with flint. The inter halls did that. So they got to a level where they're like, okay, this is like craftsmanship. Like this is sophisticated craftsmanship. And it would also probably indicate some sort of a complex language that you could explain where you get the, the gut that you turn into fiber that you use to tie the arrowhead to the stick. Like they were, they were doing, they was doing some high level stuff. Yeah.\n\nFor,\n\nSorry,\n\nGo ahead. For a primate.\n\nYeah. I would imagine also a lot of the innovation comes once you have the greater revolution because there's now surplus food. Yeah. And so you can afford to have a bunch of guys sitting around, not hunting, but like thinking about shit or inventing things or you know, making things in a different way. You know?\n\nDid you see that discovery of a skull that was 500,000 years older than they thought was the origin of human beings? So that it potentially pushes back the original homosapiens to 500,000 years? No.\n\nEarlier.\n\nIs that real? Yeah.\n\nYeah. They think it's, it might push back the date. I mean it's an under debate I'm sure. But I think they might push back the date of the rival of homo sapiens to a million years.\n\nWow.\n\nYeah.\n\nBut it just shows, you know, it's nuts. How,\n\nThis is just nuts.\n\nHow little do we know about ancient civilization? Stonehenge in the uk, which is this iconic, you know? Have\n\nYou been\n\nNo, I haven't. No, you\n\nYou should go. It's\n\nReally special energy\n\nThere, man. Yeah. It's really impressive. And like Constance said, there's a special energy and it's, it's a profoundly moving place. When you visit it, you feel as if you have a connection to something else. It's like going to the pyramids. But they have no idea. They have a rough idea of where the stones might have come from, but they've got no idea how they got there. How they erected them. Yeah.\n\nWho you should go man. Joe Rogan arrested a heath airport. That would be a great fucking story. Boy,\n\nI'm sure they can find some tweets\n\nFor us\n\nBrother. Or just the things that I've said.",
