      "transcript_chunk": "Joe Rogan podcast. Check out\n\nThe Joe Rogan experience\n\nTrain by Day. Joe Rogan podcast by night all day,\n\nGentlemen. How are you, sir? Good to\n\nSee you. Joe Rogan. Yeah.\n\nGood to see you.\n\nNice to see you, man. Your\n\nMovie's great.\n\nThank you very much.\n\nWhen does it come out\n\nIn the United States? It comes out November 7th. Okay. And then various dates over the next month and a half or so around the rest of the world.\n\nIt's a fucking heavy movie, man. Yeah. It's a heavy movie. Yeah. The, the trial, that footage, was that all real footage? The Holocaust footage? Yeah. Real footage of the, the\n\nPlow. That was one of the, one of the reasons that that inspired Jamie to go ahead. That he was given access to that footage, some of which has never been seen since 1946. Oh. You know, it's a very interesting way that he makes the subject matter accessible because it's such a dry topic from the outside. Right. Here's a court case. Right. You know, he's yet another courtroom drama. Right. Procedural or whatever. So I can imagine that people would see that and go, well, that's, you know, might not be an exciting watch or something, but he sort of puts the audience in this position where he allows them to start to be amused by some of the things that are going on and the interpersonal relationships. And, you know, when the commandant of the prison has to call up his two top mental health experts and dress them down for getting into a fist fire, you know, things like that kind of, it, it's, there's a charm to it. And then he gets you into the courtroom and he locks the door. Mm. And he goes, now you're gonna see what we're talking about. So I think it's a very interesting film device to disarm people before he starts giving them the, the real juice, you know?\n\nYeah. It's, it's also a fascinating psychological tape from the psychiatrist, from Kelly's perspective, you know, because the way he's describing all human beings, that all human beings are capable of these horrific acts. Yeah.\n\nAnd that's the thing that was a very unpopular take at the time, actually led to his removal from the process, because he wasn't fulfilling what the war department wanted him to say. Yeah. Which is, you know, all Nazis are crazy, you know, ruled by a mad man, and this is a unique experience, but that's not what he found. In sitting down talking to the 22 major Nazi sort of names that, that he was assigned to post-war, he realized that every single one of these people was, you know, as normal. Well, there was a couple that were pretty out there, but, you know, for the most part, he was dealing with rational men.\n\nYeah. That's what's scary. And\n\nHow the hell did they end up making this series of decisions if they're rational men? Well,\n\nIt just seems like things just get pushed slowly but surely into this unbelievably horrific place. Right. Like, it starts off, there's just, it's just a war. It starts off Hitler's in power, and then slowly but surely things get pushed incrementally. Yes.\n\nAnd that's the thing that's, you know, difficult because gigantic jumps we can all read. Right. But little incremental changes. Right.\n\nThe boiling of the frog,\n\nJust how, you know, you take away this person's rights, that person's personal power, you know, and slowly, you know, you get to a point where the average person then turns around and goes, how did we get to here? Right. You know, I thought it was, I thought it was about something else. You know, there's a smoke screen going up and I thought we were doing that, and as it turns out, it's very different.\n\nYeah. That's the one of the scariest aspects of human beings is our ability to dehumanize others, to turn others into something less than us non-human and other humans with families, with mothers and fathers and children. It's\n\nOne of the most dangerous things. I, I see it going on everywhere at the moment that we're trying to say that you're either, you know, and for one or of a better teen name that you're either red or that you're blue. Right. And humans are far more nuanced than that. They're not, we're not that extreme, you know? And that the idea that you can split all of us into two camps, it's kind of nuts.\n\nIt's nuts, you know? Yeah. It's\n\nNuts. And it takes out all the room for subtlety in a discussion, and therefore it makes communicating with each other less and less available. Well,\n\nIt's just, in this country in particular, I don't know about Australian politics, but we only have two parties, and they're both essentially financed by enormous corporations. So it's a, it's a ruse. The whole thing's a ruse. Right. And you have different social issues on each side that come up and, and then it becomes this year with us or against us. Right. Versus left. But it's, there's,\n\nIt's going nowhere good.\n\nNowhere good. Yeah.\n\nYeah. We have the same sort of, you know, two principle party system in Australia as well. But we have a slight advantage in that we are kind of on the edge of the world in a lot of ways, you know, so what I've always said is, when you're growing up in Australia and New Zealand, you're growing, you grow up looking out. Yes. You understand your own culture and all that, but you grow up looking out what else is happening in the rest of the world. What, what's happening in Europe, what's happening in America, you know, but by and large Americans grow up looking in,\n\nRight.\n\nThe principal sports are only played by American teams, American football, baseball in some instances, baseball. But they're not the types of sports that we play. Where the pinnacle of that sport is international competition. Right. Rugby union. Right. Rugby league, cricket. Right. Football, soccer, you know, so we, we grow at, with that as being the pinnacle of any particular sport if you get to represent your country. And that's only really relevant in an American sense for in an Olympic period, you know? Right.\n\nThat's it. Yeah. We never think about other sports. We mock them. We think about, you know, like, what are you doing playing cricket? You know?\n\nAnd it's a fascinating game. It's any, anybody who loves baseball generally, I've found baseball lovers are all about the minutiae. They're all about the stats and what those stats mean. You know, there might be a certain score on the board, but, you know, their, and their team might be getting beaten, but they see in the stats that there's, you know, a certain dominance in an area. And so they, you know, they still have a hope that the outcome of the game is, is may come their way. And cricket fans are, are the same as that. So the, the fact that the two never seem to meet is odd to me. It is odd. 'cause it's the same type of game.\n\nThis is, cricket is larger worldwide. Right? Much larger.\n\nYeah. Well you have the India. India and Pakistan. Yeah. And Sri Lanka and you know, countries like that with huge populations playing the game.\n\nDid you, do you guys have home runs in cricket, like where someone really cracks the ball and smashes outta the park? It's,\n\nIt's called a six. If you hit the ball over the fence without a bouncing, you get six runs. Oh, okay. And so that's, that's the run. Does that happen often in, see there's different forms of the game. You have T 20, then you have one day. So this is gonna be, this is gonna be difficult. T 20 means that each team gets to bowl 20 overs. An over is six balls. So you have 26 ball overs that you're bowling to the batting team. And they've gotta get, try and get as many runs as they can. Okay. And then you'll have a go at batting, right? So you have that version of the game, which is very short. It can be, it can happen in an evening. Then you have a one day game, which maybe, you know, starts in the afternoon, finishes by eight or nine at night. But then you have the test match. And this is what I grew up with it. It's sort of been dialed down a little bit now 'cause they brought in shorter forms of the game. But the test match is between two countries and it's played over five days. And the idea is that both teams have to bat and bowl twice. And the result will be whatever it is at the end of five days.\n\nThis episode is brought to you by, called Dara lab.

My cousin Martin was a great cricket player. He was the captain of New Zealand. My other cousin Jeffrey was also a captain of New Zealand. So I kind of grew up in a cricketing family. And it was one of the pathways for me. There was, you know, potentially play cricket, you know. But when you've got two of your cousins who are as good as they were, it's a very crowded room. You know, s like, well how am I gonna make any kind of statement here? When one of the Martin, at his peak, he was called by Sports Illustrated, I believe the Michael Jordan of world Cricket. Wow. He was a very dominant player in his day. And he used to call, we used to discuss test matches as the gentleman's war. 'cause you have a defined space, you have X amount of players and you've gotta stop that little ball in this gigantic 180 meter by 120 meter oval. You've gotta stop that little red ball from going between the players and therefore, you know, preventing the batsman from scoring runs. But that five day game, the way that it ebbs and flows, once you're into it, it's the only way you wanna watch cricket. 'cause it's like, you know, at one moment your team can be just so far ahead. You're like, Ugh. Just, you know, and then it'll turn on a dime and day two things get really dark for your team. You know, day three, you got an edge back again, day four. It's fantastic, man. And as a kid I used to go and attend every day of a five day game. Wow. Yeah. It was crazy.\n\nYeah, there's nothing like that here.\n\nNo, no. I mean, I mean, it really requires, I mean, just like, look at the, you know, five, five day game, it's like five news cycles, right? Yeah. We're not really set up for that sort of patience. And\n\nHow is it broadcast? Is it stream television? Television? Yeah, yeah,\n\nYeah. Yeah. I mean, you know, there's cables and companies and stuff have got involved now, but it used to be national network. And when cricket season was on, I mean, you know, back in the day people would come from overseas and into Australia and the summer and, and ask the question, is there anything else on television except sport.\n\nIs it, so when, when you're, do they take commercial breaks? Yep. Okay. They do. So that's the problem with soccer, right? Soccer in America, the reason why it's very hard to sell is not just that a lot of people don't play it right, but it's says there's no commercial breaks. Right.\n\nThey just keep going. You have a huge number of people who play association football, soccer in this country. Oh,\n\nFor sure. Listen, they have a, a professional team here. I've been to the game, but it's nowhere near the involvement that football has\n\nAmerican football, American football in this country. Yeah, for\n\nSure. Not even close. Yeah.\n\nWell see, all of our sports that we like in Australia, apart from cricket, tend to be quite compact. You know, 80 minute game, 90 minute game, 10 minute halftime, and it's part of your day. It's not your whole day. Right. It's like, we'll go to a football game and then we'll go and, you know, have dinner or go and do something else. So we have that same thing where the action is so continuous that the idea of stopping for a commercial break quite gets quite tricky.\n\nYeah, that makes sense. It's always been fascinating to me that rugby never took off in America. Yeah. Because it seems like kind of a more savage version of football. Yeah.\n\nWell the, the way I think it sort of plays out is you've got rugby union, right? Which is 15 men aside. Every time a player is tackled, you re-compete for the ball. You have rocks, mos, you have line outs. It's a very different game. But there's another version of rugby called Rugby League, which was played in the north of England. And that has a defined period of offense and defense. And I think that's where American football comes from. I actually own a team in Australia in the NRL, the National Rugby League, the South Sydney rabbits, the oldest team in the game, 1908, we were formed, bought the team in 2006. And it's very easy to explain to Americans, have American friends come down. I spend maybe 20 minutes talking to them and they get the game and they start to dig it. My girlfriend at the moment, actually Brittany, was one of the reasons why I really started being attracted to her because she understood the game straight away, you know? And then I find out that when she was younger, she was a cheerleader for the New Orleans Saints.\n\nOh,\n\nWow. While she was studying electrical engineering. So it, yeah, it, it's a very similar, rugby league is a very easy game for Americans to follow. Now, how it's refereed becomes frustrating where an American audience, because it's, there's so much room for interpretation, referee to referee game to game situation to situation. So it can get frustrating. I think one of the greatest things about American football from the outside, or from an objective point of view, it seems that every single thing that the, the NFL try to do is based on and across the board fairness for everyone. Mm. You know, so those, you know, the conversations were between the referees and what have you seemed to be, everybody's on the same page. And sometimes when you're watching rugby league, something that you saw somebody else get sent from the field for the week before, and now nothing happens this week, but it's the same kind of hit or whatever. I was like, what? You know, so I, I've had a few Americans get corrupt, very frustrated. Is that corruption? No, I think that's, yeah. I think it, the game moves very fast. Right. And, you know, referees don't have eyes on all sides of their head, you know?",

      "transcript_chunk": "I won't even guess, but I think Clapton was living in New York or London or somewhere. And he had a, he had a, a party at his house and it, 'cause he just had that record come out and it would gone number one. And he had it stuck on his fridge with a magnet. You know, like the charts with a circle around it, you know, I shot the sheriff number one, Eric Clapton and Bob Marley was at the party and apparently he found a pen and he wrote onto Clapton's fridge. No, Eric, I shot the sheriff Bob,\n\nI shot him first Bitch.\n\nThat's\n\nHilarious. But that uncut gems film is it, is it, it it, it is a perfect movie in regards to like the way it treats a degenerate gambler. He's a jewelry broker, jewelry salesman. And he's just out of his fucking mind. It's always sports, it's always this, it's, there's, there's always a game that's going on and he's betting this and it, you get so much anxiety watching the movie like, oh God, don't do that. Right. Don't do that. Don't. Oh Jesus, what are you doing? It's like the whole movie. My palms are sweating. I'm moving around in my chair because I as a kid grew up in pool halls, like from the time not grew up in pool halls, but I spent so much time between age 23 and you know, into my thirties. I was in pool halls all the time. Right. And I played a lot of pool and I was around a lot of addicted campers. And I never got it, it never hit me. But I was always just fascinated by the grip that it had on people. It was like they would, their eyes would be going back and forth. Their fucking skin would be pale. It gripped them like a drug. It gripped them like crystal meth.\n\nI, I really dislike the way in Australia we have normalized it. You know, they're doing a sports report on the news, the national news. And they'll tell you the odds. The odds.\n\nWell we do that with the UFC. The UFC. We give the odds they, they even, I don't know if they announce round by round odds, but the, I think they do, but the, I don't, I try to pay attention to it 'cause I don't vote. I, excuse me, I don't gamble on the UFC but I used to, so I used to gamble on the UFC when I first started working for them. And then I was like, I don't think I should do this anymore. No, probably not. This is a long time ago though. So what I started doing is giving my friend Aubrey, who's my business partner at on it. I started giving him tips and he was like 84%. Right? 'cause I know the sport. And a lot of these guys would be coming from Japan or coming from Russia. And I'd be like, oh, this guy on from Brazil, Anderson Silva bet the fucking house. Right? I go bet the fucking house. 'cause people do\n\nNot my house though, your\n\nHouse, not my house. But there's people that were coming across from other organizations that I was a giant fan of and the bookmakers were woefully uneducated about, especially foreign fighters. Right. And there's a thing like if you are gambling on MMA and you don't know how to fight, you're just guessing. You don't really, we're all just guessing when two guys get into the cage together. But you're really guessing. Like you really don't, you can't recognize like how fast a person is. You can't recognize how good they're at countering. You just know stats. Right. You know, but you don't know how to do it. And if you don't know how to do it, you can't really see it. You don't really know. So at A certain point in time I stopped just on my own gambling 'cause I like, I don't, 'cause I was, people were accusing me of being biased one way or the other anyway. Right. Which maybe I was, you know, I got better at that. But I wanted to make sure that no one thought that. So I was like, I'm only gambling. I'm a couple hundred bucks or something like that. I wasn't doing anything crazy. Right. But the, the fucking people that I have friends, like good friends that are just hooked and when they start talking about like fights that they're gambling on or they put so much money on this and money on that, I'm like, oh my god guy. I know guys that put millions of dollars on a fight. I'm like, oh my god. Yeah. You're freaking me out. You're fucking freaking me out man. I don't care how wealthy you are. If you put a $3 million bet on a fight and you lose, like you're not gonna sleep for a week,\n\nMan. I just wouldn't be able to wake up with myself the next day.\n\nAnd then if win, I would\n\nFeel so foolish.\n\nIf you win, it might be even worse. 'cause now you're gonna keep doing it.\n\nNow you get that, you get the sting. Yeah. The thing is with, with what we do in Australia, like the newspapers, like you know, network news services, we allow betting ads. It is so all prevailing. You know, I had an experience probably a year or two ago and I see my two boys are talking to a mate of theirs and they've all got their phones out And I realized they were checking up on their bets. You know, so I had to have a big conversation with my boys and say, look, every single dollar that you have comes outta my pocket. If I give you a dollar, that's not a dollar to gamble with. I had to have very serious conversation with 'em about, it's like, I don't care if you think it's fun, you know, I don't care. You've gotta actually see it for what it is. Yeah. Because what's five or $10 now is easily gonna turn into four or $500 in a minute. A thousand dollars. You know, sooner or later you will allow yourself to think that this thing is, you know, beyond fun and it's a way for you to earn back your losses or whatever. Right. So I just had a, had to have a, a chat with 'em and they were probably looking at me going, how old is our father that he doesn't understand that everybody does this? You know? But I just had to let 'em know from my point of view, I didn't appreciate them taking my hard earned dollars and wasting them.\n\nI get it. But I also like that it exists because I want the ability, like if I wasn't working for the UFC and I could go to the fights and gamble on the fights, I would definitely do it because it a knowledge, it wasn't to\n\nMe. Right.\n\nThis episode is brought to you by Uber Eats every football season, the same thing happens. The game somehow makes everyone really hungry. Quarterback scrambles, clearly assigned it's time for breakfast burritos, turnovers suddenly dessert at 2:00 PM doesn't sound so crazy. And wing formations. Well those can only mean buffalo wings as if they're ever not in play. Even the goalposts start looking suspiciously like french fries. It's almost like football is sending the message to eat more food. The good news Uber Eats makes those cravings easy to satisfy with game day deals all season long from wings and pizza to chips and drinks. Even last minute grocery runs, you'll find savings on all your favorites delivered straight to your door. Order Now on Uber Eats,\n\nI don't need it. If I'm into the sport. Yeah. I want to see the game, you know, I, I care about Oh yeah. What happens in the game. I\n\nGet it.\n\nPossibly because from the owner point of view, I don't, I wouldn't want any extra pressure. Of course. So I, I don't understand why here's, here's this game. It's like two teams of pristine athletes who have busted their nuts to get in this situation. And the competition, the physical competition between these two teams isn't enough. You gotta put something else on the line, you know? Well it just adds,\n\nIt adds for some people,\n\nFor some people. Yeah. Yeah.\n\nThey get that extra juice out of the knowing that, the thing is also as a commentator, I am as unbiased as humanly possible. And it's a hard thing when friends fight. 'cause there's some guys that fight that are my good friends and I'm, I'm like, I just hope they don't get hurt and I want 'em to win. But I have to be excited about the other guy winning, which is kind of crazy. The other guy's beating up your friend. Right, right. And you have to be excited about it. So it's good that I don't have any money riding on fights 'cause I don't have, I'm not happy if one person wins or loses. Right. My my idea is we're gonna see who's the better athlete, who's the better fighter. And I can handle gambling. I've never had a gambling problem because I'm, I'm not a risk averse person. Obviously I like risks, but I'm also, I'm, I'm safe. Like I know what I'm doing even though I do dangerous things.\n\nYou've had a look at it first. Yeah. You've examined, but\n\nYou do\n\nHave, you have that ability and inclination for examination. So\n\nYou have to have that. And I feel like that's the case with alcohol. That's the case with cigarettes. I'm in favor of all those things being legal. But I know so many people that have a problem with alcohol, like cannot live without alcohol. I know so many people that can't quit smoking cigarettes. I feel like you should be able to do whatever you want to do. And I want, I want freedom. And that comes with gambling. And I, I think gambling freedom, like the ability to decide that you want to take a risk of something that should be available, but we should educate people as to like, what is actually going on in your mind that's allowing you to get captured by this thing. And now you're chasing bad money and you're in a downward spiral management. Like understanding, okay, this is a thrill, but this thrill could take over your whole life. Right. If you are maybe genetically susceptible, psychologically susceptible, like understand what it is. But I don't think we should take away cars that can go over 60 miles an hour because some people crash their cars and die. You know what I mean? Yeah. It's, I, I feel like I like that gambling exists and I always wish that it existed back in the day. I was like, it'd be fun that a hundred bucks on this or a hundred bucks on that, but I don't have the problem. Like I could see if I came from a family that was torn apart by gambling and you'd go, you know, you don't understand my dad lost our house. Like, okay, but that was a bad decision. Your, you know, your dad could have died drinking and driving and smashed into a tree. These are bad decisions. You don't have to make bad decisions just because something is tempting you. It's an interesting, it's an interesting debate because do you nanny state the whole world? Do you think gambling should be illegal? Do you think you should have to go to Vegas for it? That seems kind of crazy. I mean it's certainly not a black or white issue to me. There's a lot of gray area involved in it and I know there's a lot of people that push back on the idea of, of whether these gambling apps and all these different things should be legal and like\n\nIt's the normalization process that bothers me the most. Mm. That it's part of the new service with the apps that, that it's, but it's just put in front of you whether you're interested in it or not. You know, this team is playing that team and here's the odds. Right. And I just don't, I don't think it's healthy to have that as much of, you know, tho those stats as much a part of the actual news report as who's playing and what's on the line.\n\nThe thing about it though is it does lead you to have debate about like, here's a perfect example. Canelo Alvarez versus Terence Crawford. Terence Terence Crawford was going up two weight classes. In my mind though, he's so skillful. I gave him a chance. Right. I was like, I favor him to win. But I believe he was the underdog who was the, find out what the odds were for the Canelo Alvarez. Terence Crawford fight. I believe he was the underdog even though he was an undefeated multi division world champion. Like one of the greatest of all time for sure. But he was jumping up from the 154 pound weight class where he just won the belt. He was the 147 pound weight class all the way up to 1 68. That's a big leap. 14 pounds. And everybody thought canal's gonna have too much power. He is gonna be too big. I'm like, I don't think so. I don't think that's correct. It was odds. Is it same? Yeah. Crawford was underdog. Yeah, Crawford was the underdog. So not a huge underdog. Plus 1 35 versus plus one 40 somewhere around there. So it's not huge. Not even two to one. Not even one and a half to one. But enough where I was like, I think they're wrong. You know? So it's like, it, it fosters debate, you know, even if you're not gambling. And I didn't gamble on that fight, but I did. I was telling my friends, I got a long discussion with a good buddy of mine who's a, a real boxing connoisseur. He is like, Canelo's too big, he hits too hard. I'm like, that guy doesn't get hit. Much like, I don't think that's as big of a factor as we're thinking. I think it's a skill thing. They're not that different in size. I'm like, I don't think so. And so that odds thing is to me exciting. Like, it, it fosters debate. Like you get, you start talking about, you know, and if it's a game, you start talking about players. Like he chokes in the outfield, he does this, he does that. This guy's, he's always stealing bases. I'm factoring that in and you know, the odds become a part of the discussion. But yeah, it is ultimately the problem is, first of all, kids are addicted to apps as it is. They use them, they're always on their damn phone. And they'll go from TikTok to Instagram to to x to, you know, they're check this and then they'll check that and they'll check that and they'll check their Snapchat and then they'll check the gambling app. And then it's like, you're just addicted to this goddamn phone. So something on your phone that's also addicting. It's like addiction on top of addiction. 'cause you're already getting your little dopamine rush just by looking at your phone. And then if you're also getting a gambling rush on top of that. Yeah. We gotta educate people. Yeah. But I think we gotta educate people on social media addiction, which I think a, a giant percentage of our population is completely addicted to\n\nSocial media, probably including me. I spend large amount of every day scrolling through TikTok for some reason. And\n\nWhat do you, what's your algorithm like? What kind of stuff are you getting?\n\nI'm getting a lot of dating apps at the moment, which is really embarrassing because I'm, I'm not looking on any, I'm not on any dating apps, so I'm not sure that the algorithm is fully truthful. I think there's certain amount of things you just get fed. Right. You know, for\n\nEspecially like a dating app because that's a promotion, you know? Right. They're\n\nPromoting that. Yeah. There's a lot. Seems to be a lot coming up. But that's the problem, isn't it? Because the way the algorithm shapes it, you know, pretty much everything that comes up on your phone you have some form of interest in. Right. So that keeps you looking at, at what you're looking at. Yeah. I've got to probably gotta dial it down a little bit, but I'll be in the bush in a minute. This has been such a crazy year, man. You know, so, you know, we finished Nuremberg last year and then I went on that big tour, which is when I was here, when I came to see you the first time. But this year since between December and August I made five movies. Wow. And I was on the set of the sixth and so weary and I had no juice. I, I still feel it a little bit actually, man, you know, I've had a little bit of time off, but I've still had so many responsibilities. I kind of feel like I broke my brain or something in August. Mm. And I'm still trying to recover and I won't really recover till I get home the next time. As I was saying to you before, is when I land at home now I won't know when I'm flying out again. And that is such a relief because when you do know, when you're flying out again every day is just counting down, counting down. You might have three weeks, but it doesn't feel like three weeks. Hmm. Because you 100% know when you're leaving again. But this time I'll get home and I'll have three months and I'll be in the bush and I'll be waking up with the birds and you know, hopefully all of those things that I emptied out through the, the earlier part of the year will, will fill up again.",

      "transcript_chunk": "paralysis tick. And they realized, she realized that between her and this other girl that looks after the, the puppy and we're not there, they'd got their dates mixed up. And so it wasn't actually covered for flea and tick, you know, stuff in its bloodstream. Mm. So very dangerous. So they had to shave the dog completely and everything. And they, they pulled off another couple of ticks, but there was only just the one paralysis tick. So it's okay. But if you leave that, and if you don't deal with it, the dog's gonna be dead in a minute.\n\nParalysis\n\nTick. Yeah. Yeah. It gets into their, into their body. And, and it is, it, it affects them the way the name says on the box, the\n\nParalysis. There's one that's going on in America now called, called the Well, what it, what it gives you. It's, it's a lone star tick is what what gives you this bite. And this produces something called Alpha Gal. And it makes you allergic to red meat. What? Yeah. It's my friend, my good friend Evan Fer. Got it. And he, he was allergic to red meat for a good solid year. And then eventually it went away. And then it came back again Recently. It's, it's a huge pain in the ass. So\n\nWe, we have ticks in Australia, but we've never had to deal with Lyme disease like you have here. Mm. But in the last, you know, four or five decades, people started raising deer in Australia for, for meat and what have you. And a few of them get away. You know, there's, there's no deer farms around where I am, which is north of Sydney by 600 Ks. But recently a couple of the guys that worked for me on the farm said they've seen deer going through the bush at the back of my block. You know, so that means that there's some just animals that have escaped, and they're most likely to have been in the southern highlands, which is south of Sydney. And somehow they've got themselves all the way up to where, where I am. How\n\nMany miles is that? Or kilometers?\n\nWell, we're probably talking about 700 something kilometers.\n\nThey just wandered. Yeah.\n\nWow. And, and didn't get run over or didn't get, you know, that's crazy.\n\nThat's\n\nAbsolutely.\n\nAnd they're probably bringing ticks,\n\nProbably and the wrong tics.\n\nYeah. In America, they have a problem with That too. Deer farms and this disease called chronic wasting disease, and it's spread throughout, large swaths of America have a giant issue with this, where deer herds get infected. My friend Doug Duran, he has a, a farm out in Wisconsin and they, they've had a significant problem with it to the point where they've started issuing more tags and thinning the herd. They're trying to kill more deer to try to lessen this spread of this stuff. Right. 'cause chronic wasting disease, it get, it's a PreOn disease, so it's like, it, it gets on plants. It has, it stays on them for a long time. So, and they start drooling when they have it. And in that drool is more chronic wasting disease. Right. So another deal will come along and graze on the ground where they drool, then they get it. Horrible, horrible disease. And a lot of it emanated from these deer farms\n\nWhen I first bought the farm, which was a hundred acres to start with, but it's now like 1700 and it's attached to a state forest as well. So I can get up behind my place and go for days. Oh wow. Which is just sort of like, you know, which is cool, but back in the day, we used to have platypus in the creeks. We had wombats, and now I see more foxes down. I see native animals, or I see an equivalent amount of foxes as I see wallabies\n\nAre foxes invasive. Yeah. Yeah. Okay.\n\nThere you go. And they're absolute, you know? Yeah. Because they eat anything and everything. Yeah. I used to have a big family of what we call bush turkeys living behind the house, and they're still there, but they used to just proudly walk around, you know? And, and it was fun. You'd going through the bush and then suddenly there's a road full of bush turkeys. It's great, you know, but now the population is right down and they're totally ninja now. You know, you don't see them very often when you do, they're like very suspicious. They checking you out, you know, he's just being\n\nHunted 24 7.\n\nIt's foxes, man.\n\nYeah. You also have a, a large feral cat problem,\n\nRight? Gigantic. Yeah, gigantic. The one and only cat that I let my mother have at the farm. This is way back man. I was training for Cinderella, man. And, you know, they sent me this group of boxes, Olympic guys and stuff like that. And every single one of 'em can smash the piss outta me in the ring. So I've gotta smash the piss outta 'em in other areas. So I train them until they drop, you know, getting them on bicycles and taking them to the bush, you know, and things like that. Just to sort of like, keep the balance, you know? Right. And this one particular day, and I had it in my mind that I was just gonna absolutely smash them. I was gonna get into this situation 'cause it's one road, you know? And I was just gonna get so far in front of them, psychologically damage them, you know what I mean?\n\nSo, and I, I just devious, yeah. Just\n\nHad a conversation with my mom and she was like, oh darling, you know, I, you know, I'd really love to have a cat. And I'm like, mom, we lived in this privileged situation. We've got sulfur, crested, cockatoos roses, king parrots, all these beautiful birds. And the worst thing that we could do for them is put a cat into that. So you can't have a cat. You know, I'm riding through the bush, 25, 30 Ks in at this point, right. I'm getting to the top of this hill. I'm looking down, I'm seeing these boys struggling quite some distance, probably about a kilometer and a half away from me, you know? And I'm going, good, I'll just have a little rest here. And I just hear this little noise and I'm like, what the hell is that? So I just take three or four steps off the road. You know, probably about seven or eight minutes ago, I was coming around this corner and a car was there on the road, which is kind of unusual for the state forest in that particular area. Right? So I take these three or four steps in and there's a little kitten sitting in the bush, like, what the hell? So I pick it up, it's warm, you know, I can't leave it here. So I, I put it in my backpack, right? And I complete the ride. I get to the top of this hill where this t trig station is, and everybody's standing around and I go, oh, I found a cat. You know? So I bring it out, everyone's, all these big boxes go, ooh, you know, cute little kitten. So I took it home to my mom. I said, okay, here's your cat. You know, and the way that I reasoned it is like, this is me saying to my mother, you cannot have something that will make you happy. And then the universe goes, listen to your mother. So, you know, that cat hated human beings for the rest of its life, you know? Wow. The only person it got on with was my mum. And we used to have like four bells around his neck. So to give the birds enough warning so it didn't cause too much damage. So\n\nWas a feral cat then,\n\nI think? Or was\n\nIt tossed outta that car?\n\nI think so, yeah.\n\nOh, it\n\nWas too clean and too warm for it to have been living. But that's what people do. That's, they have a problem. They have a cat that has a litter. They dunno how to solve it. Pet stores don't want it. Their friends don't want it. So they come up with the concept of just chucking them into the bush.\n\nWell, didn't it start out what they brought, they introduce cats to try to eliminate some other animal.\n\nWe have such a history of stupidity in that regard. Have you heard of the cane tote?\n\nYes. Yes.\n\nIt's just so fantastic. Right? Yeah. So, you know, they're growing sugar cane in Queensland and there's a particular flying creature that they want to control. So they start looking around. We always blame the British for this. 'cause it's usually, it's usually a naturalist, a British naturalist or scientist that comes up with the concept. And so they, they look through all the ahs, can't remember where they found it from, but they, they found this toad who seemed to have this appetite for this particular insect. And they would feed it, it ate at them. Great. So we'll introduce the cane toad to get amongst the sugar cane and lessen that creature. When they were checking if the cane toad would eat the creature, they were feeding it dead once. Right? It's a flying creature. Toad doesn't have a tongue like a frog. Can't catch this thing if it's flying. Oh. So, my God, it was of no use at all. Oh my God. In trying to lessen that com population. However, it became like a dominant species. And it was in Queensland, but now it's starting to come in New South Wales. So they're basically marching south. And it's a problem, man. It's, it's like a serious problem. They secrete poison. So if a dog gets interested and the toe gets afraid, the dog can sort of like sniff or lick its head, then get poisoned and that's the end of your dog, you know? But there was a period of time there where there's actually a documentary from the nineties called Cane Toads. And it sort of just points out how crazy people were getting with it. You know, people in a small country towns walking from their house to the pub, taking a cricket bat and just smacking the cane toes off the road as they went. You know, it's like all these people becoming like, you know, crazed with the idea of, of getting rid of the cane toe population. But it, it hasn't affected them. They just keep growing. How much\n\nIs the population now? How big is it?\n\nSo big? And these things, Jamie, can you do me a favor? Look up the weight of the largest cane toad that they found. Because it's, it's always a surprise. I mean, these things grow and if they're in the right environment and things that they can eat and feed on, they just get bigger and bigger. That's not the biggest. Look at this thing. Look at this thing, mate.\n\nWhoa. That's like an English bulldog.\n\nHowdy duty. It's bigger than my dog.\n\nOh my god. Bigger than one. My dogs look at his head. What is the weight on that fucker? What does it\n\nSay?\n\nThat's crazy.\n\nYep.\n\nI gotta find another one to add. Fuck me. Hold on.\n\nI gotta weight there.\n\nIt say how big\n\nThat was a record. Of course.\n\nIt's Oh, fat. That fucker is 2.7\n\nGrams. 5.8 pounds. Wow. That looks bigger than 5.8 pounds.\n\nIt does. But it might be a perspective thing either way. I said that\n\nWas the current one.\n\nOh. Show the video. Scroll up so you can see that video. Or make it larger, like when she's holding it. Yeah. It looks like about five pounds. Boy. Have you ever seen when they, there's a lot of horrible videos online where they take toads and they put 'em in a box with mice. You ever see what toads do to mice? No. You would never think that toads are ferocious. Right. You know, you'd never think that toads are basically monsters. These just giant mouth monsters that swallow mice's hole. But they do. They're super aggressive. It's crazy to watch. Jamie. I know you're gonna get one. I just had to\n\nMake sure it was worth pulling\n\nUp. Is this a good one? Yeah, but there's, there's ones where there's a bunch of 'em in boxes. See, this one is kind of weird because he's not freaking out yet.\n\nHe's being sneaky. Oh, what's that? Look at\n\nThat head. See him get excited. Look at his head. I mean, if that thing was giant, like that was a hippopotamus shaped chasing after you. Ah, look how quick that is. How did, how did he get it?\n\nHe must be closer than it\n\nLooks like. He just swallowed 'em whole. Yeah. Oh, watch how quick he does it. Yeah. This\n\nBit here. Oh, it's just one step forward and bang. Yeah,\n\nJust snap. Yeah. Go see if he could find one of them video. Oh, he just inhales them. Like, he literally inhaled him. He's got a little bit of a tongue. Oh, he, he grabbed him with the tongue first. Right? He yanked him in. Oh God. See if you can find those videos where there's a ton of them in a box.\n\nWe're getting two live feedings of the mice like this.\n\nEither way,\n\nThat's a giant bullfrog. It's not a cane to slightly different\n\nGiant African bullfrog either way. Point is they eat mice, they eat 'em whole. Right? And, and how many of 'em are now in Australia? How many million? Oh, here we go. This guy's just gonna go ham. It starts. Oh, he's gonna eat all of them. Look how gross those things are. They look so dumb. Just so mindless and, and gross.\n\nNo, I don't think he's gonna get all of 'em. Video's not long enough.\n\nHe hasn't gotten any of them. I can, what's going on here\n\nPast it,\n\nJust gathering them in a corner. Ugh.\n\nIt's, it's a creepy animal. So and so look, what are the numbers? Like, put that into perplexity\n\nCane toads.\n\nYeah. How many cane toads? Ask our sponsor, how many cane toads are in Australia? And what was the initial deposit? Like? How many They drop off that I had it,\n\nIt was only a couple hundred. And then they bred like 60,000 in 1937. And the answer for now is estimated at 200 million.\n\nMan. And that little flyer that eats the sugar cane, it's still there. Oh\n\nMy god. 200 million. Yeah.\n\nBut see, look, if you see where those that see that cluster of light blue balls, right? They basically in there, in the middle of that, that cluster is where they dropped them to start with. And look at how they've,\n\nWell they're gonna make their way across the whole\n\nCountry. Oh, there you go. 40, 49. So the white one is actually where they put them to start.\n\nWow.\n\nAnd everything else is migration.\n\nAnd by 2000, look how far they've gone. Mm. Wow. What's the plan to get rid of those things?\n\nI'm not sure that they have a cohesive plan. There's no\n\nPlan. Well, that's the problem. If they have a plan, they're gonna bring in some lizard or something. Yeah. In\n\nFrogs that's gonna end up gonna end up, you know, doing something else. Yeah. It's gonna\n\nKill everything\n\nElse. Every single time they've done that. You know, like in New Zealand for example, they introduced the goss bush as a way to have hedging instead of fences. But New Zealand's got a way higher rainfall and sunshine hours than England where it came from. So now it's just everywhere, you know. So beautiful arable farmlands just taken over by Gores. And when it grows in Australia, in New Zealand, it grows thicker and more prickly and much harder to, to deal with. We have the same thing in Australia with plants like Lantana just everywhere, all through the bush, you know, in my lifetime. So in 96 I used to be able to walk through certain areas of my property, just under tall trees with, you know, subtropical ferns and vines on the ground. Now there's many areas of my property that are just impossible. You cannot get through it anymore. 'cause it's choked out with introduced weeds.\n\nWhat is that crazy plant down south that we talked about Once that is overrun some of these forests, it's pretty beautiful, but it's also very creepy to see what it's done. Just like taken over all the trees, all the trees, all the, anything on the ground just covered wisteria. It, it's called kudzu. Kudzu. Yeah.\n\nI'll show you. I'll make sure this is the right stuff. That's\n\nWhat you're talking about? Yeah. That's it. Look at that. Right?\n\nIsn't\n\nThat nuts? Yeah.\n\nLike\n\nThat image is creepy. I mean, that's like a steaming\n\nAt the back of my place, man. I used to have that waterfalls and creeks.\n\nLook at that. It's taking over that whole building. That's crazy. Everything. Yeah. Just where'd they come from?\n\nSee, that's in Fiji.\n\nYeah, it's in the United States though. So what was it, how was it brought in?\n\nChina, Korea, Japan.\n\nOh, did people bring it in on purpose? That's\n\nWhere it's, that's where it's originated from.\n\nSorry. Right. History of us introduction introduced from Japan in 1876. Yeah. New Orleans Exposition. Oh, that's where I heard there's a lot of it. Vine was widely marketed in the southeast as an ornamental plant, and then it just took\n\nOver California.\n\nWow. It's, it's funny when people try to do that.",

      "transcript_chunk": "was. But that against the reality of his life and how he grew up, how he was educated, what his experiences were, who he really was as a man. There's a lot more to Goering than just looking at this going, oh, bad man Nazi. You know, he, one thing I find fascinating, when he was a kid at school, he was like one of the dumbest students in his class at a normal school. And because of his sort of continuous failure as a punishment, he got sent to military school. In military school. He was a top student because it was stuff that interested him. He comes out of school pretty much on the dawn of the first whole war, has his first military experience in the infantry as a young officer gets wounded and realizes that standing on the ground and on a battlefield is not really the right place for him. And what's interesting him is what keeps going on overhead. So he manufactures a way to get himself assigned to a, a fighter squadron is supposed to turn back up for duty with his infantry squadron. But sort of, you know, manufactures a way to keep him as associated with the fighter and learns how to become a pilot while he is doing that. And at A certain point in the war, they're losing more pilots and they train. So they go, he knows how to fly. He can be a pilot, finishes the first world war with 22 kills air to air kills. That's three times the fighting. A and he's also, because he recently passed in battle at the end of the first World War, he's in charge of the Baron v Von Richtofen, the Red Baron Squadron, which is the pinnacle of the German air force. So here he is as a young man, he's finishing that first war experience and he is a fair dinkum, which means true, he is an actual war hero. And so through the twenties he's on cigarette cards in Germany by a packet of cigarettes. And there's a picture of Herman Goring, you know? Wow. So, and he goes into that political environment, that post bizarre environment with a, a very definite belief in his country as being something special. And he wants to make a contribution to bring lifting his country out of the mare that it's, it's currently in. So he starts looking for a political connection and ends up going upstairs in a coffee house in Munich, I think it was. And hearing a fellow called Alf Hitler talk and, you know, realizes that he has a lot in common with this guy. Or he sees things and knows that Hitler was a soldier. You know, it's a funny thing we put into the movie at one point, 'cause there's a speech about Rami that Rami Mallick makes about Hitler being a failed painter and a not very good soldier. And I think the response I gave ing at the time, which is not in the film, but he talks through Hitler's actual military record. And yeah, he didn't, he didn't rise above Lance Corporal, but he turned down promotion three different times. He won an Iron Cross in 1914, and then he won a second one in 1918. And doing things that were showing such extreme courage that he was awarded the Iron Cross. And he, he delivered messages on the battlefield. He would take the messages from headquarters and take it to the frontline troops and then bring their response back. Things like that, you know. So now one point in time I had going say, you know, you call him a failed painter, but maybe he got to A certain point in his life where there were more important things to address than painting. So, you know, nuance, you know,\n\nI thought it was also fascinating that you guys delved into the fact that he was an addict.\n\nYeah. We only touch on it a little bit. Yeah. But that's, that this crazy, there's really good book blitz. I can don't remember the name. Norman Oler. Blitzed, yes. Yeah. Which gave me on a podcast, which gave a lot of information. 'cause brilliant, when, when go was arrested, he had something like 40,000 pills on him,\n\n40,000\n\nIn his car. Right. He had a, a habit of 40 to 50 a day. Right. So you look at him and you can, you can see it when you, when you know that fact and you start looking at photographs, you can see him kind of leave the planet at A certain point where he's just off his tits all the time. You know, from about 42 onwards. He doesn't really have adults' ear anymore. Bels, Himmler, hydric, they've all taken those positions. The things that he promised he could do with the look wafer didn't actually come off, you know, as strongly, they didn't know it at the time, but that's the enigma machine. Everything, the codes being broken. So no matter what they did, they were always being second guessed. So, you know, Hitler's trust of him was adjusted a little bit. And I also sort of liken it to him, knowing he's gonna get stabbed. So he just doesn't bother going to the place where he would get stabbed. You know? So he does a whole bunch of other stuff and he keeps his authority, but he's not at in the center of things anymore from that 'cause\n\nOf the pills. A big part of it,\n\nBig part of it, it's personal safety. 'cause he thinks like he's no longer has the definitive ear and trust of his leader. The pills overtake his lifestyle and he decides to, you know, interest himself in, in other things for the greater good of Germany. Like the collection of great works of art and things like that. You know. But there's a, you know, a lot of things in this story that, that are just bigger once you start looking at it and examining, they're way bigger than what we know or what we commonly understand. And that's what I was looking for, to try and find a way to, you know, understand his base motivations. And at the end of the day, he, he, you know, in his own way, he's a pure patriot, just so happens to be a sort of a, a set of beliefs or whatever that most of us in the, in a western world would call ab barrant.\n\nWow. And and you gotta take into consideration the drug aspect of the entire Nazi movement. The, all the troops were on meth. Yeah. Hitler was on opiates. I mean, Norman Oler, that book just, I, I can't recommend it enough. It's so eyeopening. 'cause you're like, well that makes sense. That's why they were so fucking psychotic. That's why\n\nThey could march through the night where\n\nThey could push three nights in a row. Yeah.\n\nThrough the, the Belgian forest.\n\nBut it's very rarely taught. This is not like when we grew up, we didn't grow up thinking that they were just drug psychotic, you know, animals that were on meth, you know, in, in tanks. And the most, the, the, that gave the people the front line, the most meth. So they had different dosages for different people depending on what they were required to do. And the tank guy got the\n\nMost meth. And if you think about ING's position, he's the one ordering the drugs. Right. How many pilots have we got? How many planes? How many missions are we doing? How many sorties Right? Do that multiplication add? 10%. For me, fucking,\n\nIt's a drug fueled war. Like probably the most drug fueled war ever. I mean, the kamikazes were using meth. And then the, the Hitler thing was, I always thought that hi hit Hitler was meth as well. But Norman was saying that he was opiates as well. Right. So just like ging. Right.\n\nThey,\n\nMaybe it was how they dealt with what they were doing. They all just stayed blasted outta their fucking head all day long.\n\nWell, I mean, look, you're surrounded by guys that have a sort of a fanatical mindset. You know, you, you're gonna wanna be awake. Yeah. You know, you don't wanna fall asleep at the wrong time if that's the group of people that you've surrounded yourself with. And that's the thing that I keep saying. It's a, it's an old cliche, but I, I think it's something that he, he really learned, you know, if you lie down with dogs, you're gonna get fleas, Herman. Yeah. You know? Yeah. But I think him cleaning up by being forced by being in a prison environment, being forced by the allies to go cold Turkey nearly killed him. He had sort of heart problems because he went from 40 or 50 a day to nothing. So, but that clarity of thought that he had after being clean for, you know, six or nine months when the trial starts, that became dangerous. Because now he's sort of got his faculties back. And his intent on breaking down this whole idea of international law as, as being ridiculous. That, you know, he's a man who served his country. He's still in a uniform. He's still like a, a, a military guy. So he's quote unquote following orders. Yeah. And, you know, they were a demo democratically elected government who then step by step dismantled democracy once they were in power.\n\nAnd the fascinating thing about this character, and the way you play him is, in the beginning, he seems like a guy on opiates. 'cause he's like so relaxed about everything. You know, it's like he doesn't seem to be carrying the weight of what's happened to him. Right. And for you to, and then there's dark moments, particularly like during the trial where you are like, whoa, there's a lot of range to this guy. And that's gotta be a weird place to be to, for you to try to put yourself in the mind of what ultimately became one of the most horrific figures in modern history.\n\nYeah. It's not comfortable. It's not comfortable, but that, that pain's part of the gig, you know? Yeah. It, it really is. And there's, you, you, you sort of learn to accept it. And I say this to people quite a lot 'cause they, you know, big question is how do you turn off, you know, when you've been a Nazi for a day, what do you do to relax?\n\nDefinitely don't do method.\n\nYeah. But the, the, you know, you ask anybody and, and you would be the same just because in a little while the podcast is over for the day, doesn't mean that that's the end of your job. Doesn't mean you're just gonna turn off and never think about it again until you're gonna, obviously, you know, anybody has a passion for the thing that they do is gonna continue the process. Five o'clock might be when the office closes, but you're gonna go home, you're gonna have dinner, you're gonna think about the deal that you're currently doing, the presentation that's ahead of you, or whatever it happens to be. You're gonna keep processing. And that's what happens when you, you're playing a character. 'cause you might have delivered x amount of dialogue today, but you've got x amount tomorrow too. So you've gotta keep that process going. So,\n\nSo you're just thinking about a Nazi\n\nAll the time, time 24 7 all the time. There's no, it's relentless. One, one description of of making a movie is that it's a train journey. It's not like a car, you know, where you can pull over and have a wee on the side of the road. It's a train journey. And once you get on that train, you're staying there until it gets to its destination. And you've just gotta accept that. I mean, and that there's, you know, good and bad. And that there's a, a, a saying that goes with this, you know, the, the best thing and the worst thing about the job that I do is that one day it's gonna finish. Always finishes. You can be having the worst time of your life, but it's gonna finish. But you can be having the greatest time, you know, have the incredible relationship with the crew and the cast and the director. But it's gonna finish. And you have to get used to that. You have to understand that.\n\nWhen, how much time did you prepare and how much time did you film for? So like how much time were you actually in the head of this Nazi? Well,\n\nI, I signed on in 2019. So\n\nYou started thinking about\n\nIt then? I thought I was going straight from loudest voice, which finished shooting around April or something like that. And I thought by the end of that year we'd be doing, you know, we would've shot that film.\n\nSo that's when you started researching it. Yeah.\n\nAnd then as it turns out, we got set up and collapsed three different times. And so I had five years, five years of, you know, scratching around trying to find little bits of information to humanize him in my mind, but also for me to try and understand him and understand the, you know, what he got. Because on it, it doesn't make a lot of sense when you read about his history and stuff. And where he gets to doesn't make a lot of sense. He was a mountain climber really. Right. When he was a young man. There are traverses and the Austrian Alps that Herman Goring was the first person to do that traverse of that peak. And you think about the mentality required of a mountaineer to stand at the base of a big ass rock and look up and say, I'm gonna keep going until I reach that summit. That says a lot about who Herman Goring really was and you know, who's Bavarian. Right. So from southern Germany. And once I, 'cause I didn't know he was a mountain climber. Once I knew that, then I started looking around for, well, what does that mean to be a mountain climber? You know, prior to the first World War, what kind of equipment would you have? And it's very basic, man. It's nothing, you know, you gotta, you're relying on your wits and your strength just completely. And yeah,\n\nThey didn't even have nylon ropes.\n\nProbably not.\n\nNo,\n\nNo. But not then. Right. Just all stretchy hemp. Oh Jesus, that's gonna be behave completely differently once it gets wet. But it gave me some real insight to him. But, and it also ended up giving me this great way of connecting to the other German guys who were playing the other Nazis. You know, because I just knew from the first day when they all arrived and they were sitting together in a group, I could see that they were already feeling the punishment of playing that kind of character. So I just brought them together and I asked them, 'cause now you know, these guys, some of them are German, some of them are Hungarian. And I said, look, you know, there's this song that I found and I'd like to learn the song together. And they all, you know, most of them knew the song. But that's what we would do every day as a group. We'd get together, we'd sing that song, and then we'd walk into court together feeling connected as a unit. You know?\n\nWhat kind of song was it?\n\nIt's called Mussi Den.\n\nIs it a German song?\n\nIt's a German song. And, well, I didn't realize when I first came across song, it's a Barbarian Mountain song. So he definitely knew that song. It's actually the melody that Elvis Presley uses for the song Wooden Heart in the movie Chi Blues Zoom. Stay late in Hal, stay late in Hal. You know, that's, but I don't have a wooden heart. That's what we're busy singing together. So\n\nYou guys would sing this to get into the character\n\nAnd you Wow. Be the calm. Yeah. So there's just a little thing just to remind that particular group of guys that we we're just actors we're just playing roles and you know, this will finish.\n\nThere's a lot of people that don't want to show a human side of a monster. Hmm.\n\nAnd which I think is very dangerous and quite stupid. You know, because it gives you a complete misunderstanding of what a monster is. You know, that. Yes. Okay. Here's somebody with, you know, horrific expert as the joke used to be. Even Hitler, you know, he used to love dogs. So that's the joke. Right. You know, and, and that, but there's some real truth in understanding the human process in that, that somebody who makes the absolute worst decision in the world can still be a loving father.\n\nMm.\n\nYou know, can still have a group of friends, but on, you know, a particular, in a particular moment that is the same person who's made this horrific decision that will have terrible effect on a, a generation of people.\n\nYeah. I mean it's, it's really the same kind of thing we were talking about with Tony Soprano.\n\nRight.\n\nLike that this, this person is a terrible person, but yet loves his kids. Right. Loves his friends. Yeah.\n\nWell, charm is one of the greatest weapons of evil. Yeah. You know, it's, it's a really, you know, it's a, it's a fun thing for us. We see somebody, you know, who can tell a story, tell a joke, hold a tension in a room. Yeah. You go, it's cool.",

You know, and, and that, but there's some real truth in understanding the human process in that, that somebody who makes the absolute worst decision in the world can still be a loving father.\n\nMm.\n\nYou know, can still have a group of friends, but on, you know, a particular, in a particular moment that is the same person who's made this horrific decision that will have terrible effect on a, a generation of people.\n\nYeah.

We see somebody, you know, who can tell a story, tell a joke, hold a tension in a room. Yeah. You go, it's cool. But when that process of charm goes to this other place, which becomes about life and death or the're taking away of people's rights, the dehumanizing of people as we were discussing earlier, you know, and there's, you know, I, I don't want to get into politics 'cause I have this, my, my boys have this rule. If you're gonna talk to Joe, you're not allowed to discuss politics.\n\nBecause they know once I start your boys, my, my two sons\n\nYeah's. Because my youngest boy, I think I told you, he, he became obsessed with you and, and listening to your st stuff for a while. And you became one of his sort of points of education and, you know, so that's why I started listening to you. 'cause I wanted to know what he was hearing, you know? And I go and I, I, after listening a few times, I was like, you know what man, it's cool. You know, the 'cause again, we'll use that, that word you do actually have the allowance for nuance. And that's the greatest thing about this situation. We sit down to talk, we're gonna be talking for a couple of hours. Yeah. So I don't have to reduce everything. I wanna talk to you about to make it pop in three minutes.\n\nRight. And worry about things being taken outta context in a soundbite. Right? Yeah. That this is the issue with discussing any positive attribute to a Nazi. You know what I mean? Like, you, you open up that door. Oh my God. Russell Crowe's a Nazi sympathizer.\n\nBut the people that\n\nDon't like you are just gonna take that.\n\nYeah. Yeah. And here's what Joe Rogan's discussing. Yeah,\n\nYeah, yeah. But it's, I think what you're saying is absolutely true. That it is stupid to think that way because it, because that's a human being and a very fucked up evil human being that did horrific things. But know that that is a path that people can go down even if they think they're doing the right thing. So we\n\nAre taught, for example, to regard Gaddafi in a certain way. Okay. But if you look into what happened in his country while he was the leader, you look into the fact that every person is given a house at a certain age. You look at the fact that everybody's education and healthcare is free. You look at, if somebody showed a particular talent for something that required further education overseas, all of the costs of that were paid for by the government. Now these are all things put in place by the same country's leader that we are told is evil and corrupt.\n\nYeah.\n\nSo it doesn't quite balance.\n\nWell, there's also us government interference. That's a, that's a, that is one that we definitely monkeyed with. I mean, he ran afoul of the United States government, you know,\n\nWell, what he was trying to do, as far as I understand the situation is he was trying to unite Africa and a United Africa is gonna be, it's a problem. Well, either it's gonna be fantastic. Right. It's gonna be amazing.\n\nA problem for the people that wanna run things. Yeah. Yeah. If all of a sudden there's a new Subaru\n\nPower, you've got a whole bunch of countries that, that, you know, have a connection with a certain African nation or whatever that suck their, you know, minerals out of the ground or whatever, don't pay them properly for it. Yep. You know, and and greatly benefit financially. And that's pretty much every European country's got some kind of African connection in that regard. And\n\nIncluding China.\n\nWell, China's now coming in. Yeah. Because it's able to offer a slightly better deal than they've been used to, you know? But people have to understand you. The population of Africa is enormous. Yeah. Enormous. You've got multiple countries with hundreds of millions of people.\n\nWell, when you see the continent of Africa and you see all these other countries, how many would fit inside of it? You're like, oh boy. Yeah. 'cause that's the weird thing about maps and globes is you get a distortion of the actual true\n\nSize. Well there is a distortion, right? Yeah. Whatever that's called, which shows America at the center and being physically a larger landmass than it actually is in relative terms. Oh, it's\n\nA little bit, it is the size of Australia.\n\nA hundred thousand square miles. Continental USA is a hundred thousand square miles larger than the island of Australia.\n\nThat's not much. Not\n\nMuch.\n\nThat's not much. It's not much, man. Especially when you think that you guys have 20 what? 25? 25. And we have probably 325 plus. Right. I don't think we know really how many people we have, but we have at least 320 million. Yeah, that's a lot of folks.\n\nA lot of people man. Yeah. It's a hell of a lot of people.\n\nSo we'd like to think we're a lot bigger than we are, but then you look at where we fit in Africa, you're like, oh, it's like, it's a little tiny little tiny thing.\n\nI think there's someone like 55 countries or something in Africa.\n\nI don't know. It's probably, yeah. I mean it's also Egypt. That's the other thing, you know, it's also like the most advanced civilization possibly that ever existed before today. And they were there too. It's like, it's a wild place. Like from top to bottom. It's a very, and it's the origin possibly of humankind\n\nAnd a lot more desert, I think, than, than people realize. You know, you have the Sahara and stuff, we all know that. But then there's these other gigantic areas like that. But would that be the West coast? Have you seen those roads in like Namibia or whatever where it's just, it's like a sand dune. It's 40, 50 meters high, drops down to the ocean and there's one little flat bit that there's a road. And that's possible, you know, at certain times or whatever, if the tides are not doing this and that, but that's the road. Jeez. It's like a mountain of sand and an ocean and a one little ribbon.\n\nGeez. It's, you know, United States is one of the weird things about us is that we're, we're a country that thinks mostly of ourselves and hardly ever leaves. You know, some people leave, but yeah, I bet there's a solid percentage of people that never leave the United States and maybe never even leave their city. Right. And your version of the world, you're relying on other people to give you the story of what the world is. Until you go somewhere, until you go to Thailand, until you go somewhere and you're like, wow, there's a totally different way of living out here.\n\nYeah. I've even had people, you know, come down to help me with movies or whatever, like guys that are coming down to train me and some weapon or other or whatever, and they do a lot of traveling, but it's all within the continental USA.\n\nYeah.\n\nAnd they come to Australia and they didn't realize that other people have opinions. You're not gonna find a heck of a lot of agreement to, you know, some very basic tenants. If you sit in an Australian bar, you'll find a whole bunch of people go, that's fucking stupid, mate.\n\nYeah.\n\nYou know? But look, it's still, to me it's the, the greatest country in the world is the United States of America. Absolutely greatest potentials are all here. But how it's founded on balance and fairness and opportunity, that's how it remains. Great. Not because you start taking opportunity away from people. Right. Because you are affording them opportunity. And, you know, just, it's,\n\nJust\n\nKeep that in mind, ladies and Gentlemen. Yes.\n\nBecause\n\nIt, nothing's finished, nothing's done. We're just in the process and it can all get better. For sure.\n\nYeah. And it's the rare country that is almost entirely founded by people moving here over time. Yeah.\n\nIt's all immigration.\n\nYeah. Yeah. Which is the strength. And also, you know, the, the problem with the last four years was that they were just letting anybody in and they weren't vetting people. Right. And they were inviting people in. And the problem now is they're grabbing people that are productive citizens and they're grabbing 'em and taking 'em out. 'cause they don't have the right paperwork. Yeah. So neither one is a good solution and both of them cause huge problems. Yeah. And one of the scary things. But\n\nYou do have to be aware too, though, a lot of the information that we know about that is coming to us from a motivation that we don't necessarily read. Right. They want us to think of things in negative terms. Sure.\n\nBoth sides. On both sides of the issue. Yeah. A hundred percent. Yeah. We're, we're constantly being manipulated. I had Representative Luna on the podcast and one of the things that she said that that, that I kind of knew was probably true, but I didn't wanna believe it. She was like, there's a lot of problems they never solve on purpose, so that they could campaign against them. And that's why they, they keep these things in play. That resolutions could have been reached, problems could have been solved. But these politicians are so self-serving that they don't ever want that to take place. Yeah. These people that run, these two individual parties want to keep that, that banter back and forth. They wanna keep the argument going. And\n\nYou see how absolute they are. If you know somebody with that color hat is trying to promote something, you know, the person with the other color hat. So that's absolutely ridiculous. Then it changes. An election happens. Now the person with a different colored hat, they're in charge and they're gonna put in place exactly what they said the other person was doing that was wrong. Yeah. Is now part of their policy platform.\n\nWhat is wrong with the way Australia's run? Well,\n\nWe're a little bit lucky at the moment. We have a prime minister who's very much motivated by trying to help everybody, you know, which should be the job of a politician, right? Sure. To improve the lives of the people that they represent. And he's kind of inherited, You know, a conga line of stupidity that was going on, you know, and he's trying to fix things. But of course, just the way things are reported, whatever, you know, there's, there's haters on every corner. But he's a good man and he's doing his very best and he's, you know, working extremely hard. But, you know, like he arrives off a plane the other day. He's just come back home from some very successful international meetings where he is established various trade things and, and opportunities and situations for Australia. Gets off the plane wearing a Joy Division T-shirt. Right. Big band from his youth. And he's just a relaxed character. You know, he's been wearing a suit and tie for weeks on the road. He's just walking off Australia's version of Air Force One in the Joy Division t-shirt. So the member of the opposition wanted to point out and did so in parliament that joy division is a Nazi term and comes from a section of a particular camp where the women were prostituted. And that's why it was called the Joy Division. And it's like, okay, what's the point of that? Right. We all know it's a band name. We know it's, it's a band name. Right. And just 'cause you like the Rolling Stones doesn't mean that you want rocks to be falling on people. What are you fucking talking about? You know, this whole stupidity and that's what you're facing all the time. Picking up some pointless piece of minutia and, you know, lighting it on fire and making a smokescreen to cover up the reality of the fact that that Prime Minister just worked his ass off on behalf of the country and successfully achieved a bunch of things and should be patted on the back, you know, not pushed down the stairs.\n\nYeah. Well we have a lot of that here too. That's,\n\nBut there is a timidity to a timidity I think is probably the thing in terms of how Australia is run. Things like the, the gambling ads and stuff like that. Common sense would tell you this is not a good thing to allow, you know, put the timing of these ads back so kids are asleep or whatever. Don't let them read out the odds on the news that you could fix that pretty quick. But that gambling section of the community is worth a lot of money and people in positions of power. 'cause it's not necessarily, you know, it's, it's not the guy that's gonna spend his whole wages gambling through an app that, that gets to have a say in this. You know, it's the guy whose family money allows him to run a string of 18, you know, race horses and he enjoys going to the races on the weekend. And, you know, gambling for him is not such a big deal because he's got, you know, an income from other things, blah, blah, blah. You know, so it's the wrong perspective on a problem sometimes is the actual problem.\n\nMm. And the fact that this is a fairly new thing and that young people growing up with this, there's not a history of people abusing gambling apps. Right. It's not, it's not something their parents had to deal with. It's\n\nRight. Generationally. It's not something that I can, oh, I, you know, from my experience, I can tell you this, so I had to have a, you know, when I had that conversation with my boys, it was a broader conversation about gambling and about, you know, what it takes to earn a dollar.\n\nYeah. The, I think the accessibility issue is something that people have problem with. The fact that it's on a phone versus going to a place, right. You choose to, you're gonna get your buddies together. You are gonna go play poker in a casino. Right. That's a different decision, right. Yeah.\n\nThan just sitting at home. Yeah. You know, and just constantly frittering away your money. Well\n\nThis is the thing, it's just we are, there's always some sort of point of attack. There's always an attack vector for people getting your attention or getting your money and trying to, and then we have to decide as a society, like do we, is this good to just allow, like we want freedom, but do we want to, like you can't advertise cigarettes on TV anymore. Right. They decided at one point in time, this is crazy. Cigarettes are bad for, you can advertise\n\nAlcohol,\n\nYou still can. Yeah. Yeah. Which\n\nIs weird. That's a certain time of day. Yeah.\n\nIt's weird. Yeah, it's weird. 'cause alcohol probably kills more people than cigarettes.\n\nThat funny thing that we have that was fed to us that, you know, cigarettes are this incredible burden on our health healthcare system. In reality, if you look at it, it's a burden. But, you know, there's a lot of people dying of lung cancer who've never had a cigarette. So we haven't really solved that. We don't really know where that's coming from. But in reality, the burden on our healthcare system is obesity and all the problems that come from obesity. That's the biggest. Yeah. We allow food production systems that we know to be extremely unhealthy and very bad. We just allow them to continue on. You know, we've got items of quote unquote food that have been tested and turns out there's no actual food in this. It's just, you know, a manufactured product. I think the, the famous one here was the, the Twine thing. Right? When they actually got around to looking at what was in a twine, they realized that every single part of it was completely unhealthy. Yeah.",

      "transcript_chunk": "eople than cigarettes.\n\nThat funny thing that we have that was fed to us that, you know, cigarettes are this incredible burden on our health healthcare system. In reality, if you look at it, it's a burden. But, you know, there's a lot of people dying of lung cancer who've never had a cigarette. So we haven't really solved that. We don't really know where that's coming from. But in reality, the burden on our healthcare system is obesity and all the problems that come from obesity. That's the biggest. Yeah. We allow food production systems that we know to be extremely unhealthy and very bad. We just allow them to continue on. You know, we've got items of quote unquote food that have been tested and turns out there's no actual food in this. It's just, you know, a manufactured product. I think the, the famous one here was the, the Twine thing. Right? When they actually got around to looking at what was in a twine, they realized that every single part of it was completely unhealthy. Yeah.\n\nIt's just mostly sugar, right? Yeah. Yeah. But Twinkies are delicious and I think you should be able to buy Twinkies, you know what I mean? So I, I'm on both sides of it. I'm a healthy person. I eat 99% of my food is very healthy, but I think you should be able to do whatever the fuck you want. It's just education is the most important thing. And letting people know what they're, and then teaching people some discipline and how to be able to exercise some control over yourself.\n\nSo I was 126 kilos when I finished Nuremberg.\n\nMm.\n\nI'm a hundred 0.9 right now.\n\nThat's amazing. Congratulations. Well,\n\nA lot of that.\n\nYou look great by the way. Thanks. Really do\n\nA lot of that is because you introduced me to your mate Brigham\n\nFrom Waist Towell. Yeah. Yeah.\n\nAnd so I've probably connected with them about five times since that first time we went. And the real benefit that I'm getting that I think, right, because I'm not, not completely over the science, but it seems to be with these injections that I've been getting into my shoulders, into my knees, but also IVs that it's calmed down my body's inflammation. You know, I think we talked before about just how many old injuries I carry, you know, and how like the injuries in my shoulders have a deeply arthritic, but we can now see in an ultrasound over time how, what was messy a year ago and like big thick bands of of arthritis now it's just lessened. You know, probably by about 70% on one area of my right shoulder, probably about 90%. So my range of motion, if we'd done this last year, would've been about there. Right. But now is fucking rock and roll something, you\n\nKnow what I mean? Isn't that great? It's all\n\nGoing good, you know? I know. It's amazing. And like, just feeling like the musculature starting to build and everything. I'm taking it really slowly. And that was one of the things I was worried about with Highlander because jumping into that role with the shooting date coming, it was like, man, I've gotta do, I've gotta do three workouts a day. I gotta, you know, and that for me is a bad recipe because yeah, I can, I can do that for X amount of time, but once I stop, I'm gonna stop completely. You know? And what I want to do is I wanna make all these changes and make it a long-term situation. So I think the Waste two world was a great call for me because it's calmed down a bunch of stuff. It's taken a bunch of pain away, you know, so I can go and work out and not have to suffer for two or three hours afterwards. Yeah. You know, you know, I'm still picking up injuries 'cause I've gotta face the fact I'm 61. Yeah. You know, like the other day I'm doing my cat guitar dinosaur trying to get this fricking move going on. A fricking tore the tendon here on the ulnar. Ugh. So that's gonna be bad for sword fighting, but I'm trying to fix that without having to have a, a surgical,\n\nHow bad is it torn?\n\nIt's only a little bit really, you know. Okay.\n\nYou just gotta make sure you don't overuse it while it's healing. Can you brace it? Well\n\nThe, the, the problem I've got is I've got X amount of time to claim the skill and either way, right. If I do the rehab exercises without doing surgery, if it fails, I'm now falling right on production and you know, of re torn or something. Right.\n\nBut I can help you with that. Just do this skill slowly.\n\nYeah.\n\nHere's the thing about skills. Skills that you learn slowly. You can translate into high speed quickly. Yeah. Because you develop a neural pathway. So instead of using an actual sword, use a foam sword use like one of those little fucking noodle things that people put in the pool. Use that. So you're just, just develop them. When I was teaching martial arts, one of the things that I always tell people is don't try to do it quickly when I show you something, I want you to do it slowly.\n\nThat's exactly what I did. Yeah. I'm in a car park and we were talking about the speed of something and I went, oh yeah, so you get sh and I went, oh fuck.\n\nAnd I\n\nKnew I to, but I just put my sword away and I kept the conversation going. Didn't mention it, but I got home and I was like, oh fuck.\n\nOh, you rushed, you didn't warm up. Yeah.\n\nWell the thing is we were warm, but it was a thing that I just, just in that split second, I thought, I wonder what it's like to go full speed. Oh. And I did it and I, and I just like, no way too early. But you're absolutely right. Pace is deceptive. Yeah. If you learn something, I mean, you know, that's like that old fashioned sort of stuff with with with the karate I first did when I was a kid, you know, they aim for you to do 10,000 of something before you have to use it in an actual competitive fight. You know?\n\nYeah. People who train people with guns have a saying, slow is smooth, smooth is fast.\n\nRight? Yeah.\n\nYeah. Absolutely. You want herky jerky movements and with martial arts and specifically sword fighting, it's, there's very specific movements that you're learning. And if you learn those movements slow as you speed up, you'll be going along the right pathway. And when I would teach people kicks in particular because it's a weird thing to learn how to kick something. Like you've gotta do it slowly. 'cause if you try to muscle it, you're gonna develop a bad habit that's gonna keep you from achieving full power because you want a proper technique. Yeah. And\n\nYou have to process where your balance is. Yeah. You know, what you, how you're pushing your force, but how you retain Yeah. You know, the ability to reset. Yeah.\n\nYeah. Juujitsu as well. People that learn by drilling, they get way better, way quicker by doing it flowing and doing it more easy and play like the Gracie's always say keep it playful. Yeah.\n\nLike that's, well see the thing is I know all this stuff, but I was in such a point of weariness that I was just trying to please people. Right. Oh. And so I muck myself up and you know, but I've got a bit of time now for it to heal and for me to start and actually do like, I like to do, you know,\n\nHave you visited Brigham while you're here?\n\nYeah. Yeah. I saw him missed that. Okay, great. Yeah, he's looking great.\n\nYeah, he looks great, right? Yeah. He is looking good.\n\nHe'll look you up the new, the new place. And now here's the thing. We talk about this and your listeners would probably, you know, it's expensive. No two ways about it. So it's possibly not at everybody's grasp what the sort of things that I'm doing. But I think, I'm not sure if this is absolutely right, but I think, you know, one of his sort of fervent ambitions Brigham, is to make it more available. Yes. You know, because this should be, this is cutting edge medicine. Yes. You know, if we can sort of write things in our bodies with an injection as opposed to an operation, you know, the problem I had in my left shoulder, I go and see my shoulder surgeon who fixed it while I was doing Cinderella, man. And so I did two operations with this guy, one in 2001 and the second one in 2004. But it's always had a sort of problem. And, and he did say at the time, after the second operation, that he had to cut a few corners and it would probably cause me problems later on in life. So I probably went to see him about five or six years ago and he said, okay, so you are, this shoulder is at a point of arthritis. Now what we have to do is we have to cut through the muscle bar, we have to pop out the humeral head of your arm bone. We have to shave off the top of the humal head and then we have to put a carbon fiber cap and then we have to put it back in. So everything back up, you've got about 12 months of rehab. Right. Just sounds wrong. You know, it just sounds wrong. It's like, you know, so this process that I've been going through with Brigham, basically having the effect of layering so I can now see that if the arthritis was that deep, it's now this deep, you know, it's still there. I haven't solved it yet, but I'm giving my body what it needs to make it better.\n\nAlso, there's new breakthroughs almost every week, right. And these new breakthroughs, they're, they're able to achieve the, the, they're, they're growing actual cartilage on people that were bone on bone. Right? So they're, they're developing new methods to regenerate tissue. That's the cushioning in between your, your knees and your elbows and all these things that were, and shoulders that we're requiring people to get those horrific things. Putting an artificial joint in place. 'cause everything is so arthritic.\n\nThat's one of the things that does trouble me greatly in for this country health medical systems to benefit everybody. Something has perverted here where, you know, the drug that I might need that I can buy for $50 for a month supply in Australia is two and a half thousand dollars for a month here. Yeah. Come on man. I know what's going on. It's crazy. You know, and where's, see you've got all these elected representatives here and this country's got, you know, a lot, you know, that's what you should be working on man. You know? Yeah.\n\nBut they can't\n\nBecause everybody's got their, their hands\n\n500 back. Everybodys their hands tied. Yeah. They're all got their, including the media. That's the crazy things. The amount of money they spend on advertising for the media that really just serves the purpose of now the media can't criticize the pharmaceutical drug companies. Right.\n\nWild. Yeah. Wild. It's interesting. It's because, you know, I get back here as you know, you know, my girlfriend's from New Orleans and you know, we're sitting and watching TV here and she's now seeing America from the outside. 'cause she spends most of the time traveling with me. And we don't spend that much time in, within America. You know, we live in Australia, but we've been, I've been working mainly in, in, in Europe the last few years. So she's now coming back to her country, but she's got fresh eyes and she's sitting there the other night she was watching something. She came out, she said, I've just watched like 12 ads for drugs. Right. Just one after the other, after the other, after the other. You know what, what's this tiny little problem that you might have? Or you know, if I can say it in a certain way to make you think that you've got it, bang, I got a drug for it. Bang, bang. You know? And yeah. I mean 600,000 plus people in this country in the next 12 months will go bankrupt because of their medical bills. You know how many people will go bankrupt in Australia because of their medical bills in the next 12 months?\n\nZero. Zero.\n\nYeah.\n\nYeah. It's one of the biggest problems we have. You know, and the idea that you would let that happen and not do anything about it because you're bought and paid for by these enormous companies is kind of insane. Yeah. It's insane. And they're trying, they're trying to do something about that, you know, and RFK junior's fighting an uphill battle trying to do something about that. But it's a captured industry.\n\nYeah. Yeah.\n\nAnd you know,\n\nThe\n\nFact socialized medicine, fact,\n\nProbably the fact the largest western economy is punishing its citizens in that way. Yeah. Just beggars belief. That's crazy that healthcare isn't such a principle thing. 'cause if, if, if we're not looking after ourselves and aiming for the longest life, what's the point of the human existence kind of thing. You know what I mean? So that should be a principle. Everybody's health should be a principle focus of our elected representative. Well\n\nSaid. Russell Crowe, you're the fucking man.

I think\n\nI always thought that was CGI.\n\nNo, I, I think one of the, I think the upper right one is not him. That's not that\n\nOne to the left of that. Like, that's real. No, that's, that's artificial, bro. That's fake. That's got that uncanny valley feel to it, doesn't it?\n\nIt's, it's not impossible.\n\nNo, no. It's not impossible to achieve, but it's not, it's not possible to maintain that kind of leanness.\n\nThat's a crazy No, I mean, that's like, like you're, you're, you're also at that point, you're, they're there. He's dehydrating and all sorts of things.\n\nOh, it's based on a real person. Yeah.\n\nYeah. Based on, right.\n\nBut it's not a real person. What\n\nDoes he really look like?\n\nLike those images, I think are bullshit. Some of 'em are real. Is that real? Okay. That real. That looks real. That looks a really Jack bodybuilder. Yeah. Yeah. That looks real. Like, that's achievable. But there's a few of those images where you're just like, what's going on here?\n\nYeah. Yeah. Yeah. Totally. Well, I mean, you see, you see it Is that, is that the ice? That's\n\nThe real dude.\n\nWell, there's that, that, that Icelandic dude who's Thor.\n\nOh yeah. The guy who jumps in the frozen lakes and shit. Yeah. Well,\n\nThe, the guy who played the mountain. Oh,\n\nThat guy that is, yeah. That\n\nIs like a, that, that is like a, a mutant strong human. Yes. Like, like he would be in like the X-Men or something, you know, we were hanging out. I mean, he's, he's just like, not like, and, and, and then is that, you know, that I've seen that meme tent and tent bag. No. You know how like, it's like, it's really hard to get the tent tent in the tent. Oh, right,\n\nRight. That's true. Then\n\nThere's a picture of of him and his girlfriend with\n\nOh, right. That's hilarious. Yeah. Yeah. That's, I don't know how\n\nIt gets in there, you know, it's like, seems too small. But\n\nI met Brian Shaw. Brian Shaw's like the world's most powerful man. Yeah. And he's almost seven feet tall. He's 400 pounds. And his, his bone density is one in 500 million people. So there's one, it's like, there's like maybe 16, 16 people.\n\nI mean, he dense\n\nBones. He's an enormous human being. Okay. Like a legitimate giant, just like that guy. Yeah. Yeah. But we met him. He was hanging out with us in the green room of the mothership. But it's like, okay, if this is like David and Goliath days, like Yeah. Yeah. This is an actual giant, like the giant of the Bible.\n\nOnce in a while, they get a super giant person. This is a\n\nReal, a real one. Like not tall, skinny basketball player. Yeah, yeah. Like a seven foot, 400 pound powerlifter.\n\nLike, you don't want to especially\n\nLook at him. That's the guy. See if there's a photo of him standing next to like a regular human. I was trying to get this. There it is. Yeah. That's him right there. Like,\n\nThere's like, there's like one of him with next to standing next to Arnold and stuff. Yeah. And it's where, and Arnold, everyone, everyone just looks tiny. I mean, I think he's a pretty cool dude actually.\n\nOh, Brian's very cool. Very smart, too. Unusually, you know, you expect anybody to be that big, it's gotta be a moron. Yeah. But no.\n\nYeah, there was, there was Andre the Giant who was awesome. Yeah. He was great in Princess Brian. No,\n\nHe was just awesome. Period. Yeah. Yeah. So we were talking about this interview with Sam Altman and Tucker, and I was like, we should probably just talk about this on the air, because it is one of the craziest interviews I think I've ever seen in my life. Yeah. Where Tucker starts bringing up this guy who was Yeah.\n\nA whistleblower or whatever. A\n\nWhistleblower Yeah. Who, you know, committed suicide, but doesn't look like it. And, and he's talking to Sam Altman about this, and Sam Altman's like, are you accusing me? He's like, no, no, no, I'm not. I'm just saying. I I think someone killed him. Yeah.\n\nAnd like, and it should be investigated. Yeah. Not just drop the case.\n\nIt seems like\n\nThat they just dropped the case. Yeah, yeah. Yeah. It seems, but his parents think he was murdered. Yeah. The wires to a security camera were cut blood\n\nIn two rooms,\n\nBlood in two rooms. Someone else's wig was in the room. Someone\n\nElse's wig. Wig, wig. Yes. Yes. Not, not normal. His wig not normal to have a wig laying around. Yes.\n\nAnd, and he ordered DoorDash right before allegedly committing suicide. Yeah. Which is seems unusual, you know? Yeah. It's like, you know, let's, I'm gonna order pizza on second. Thoughts, I'll kill myself. Is it seems like that's a very rapid change in mindset. It's\n\nVery weird. And especially the parents have, they, they don't believe he committed suicide at all.\n\nHas no note or anything. No.\n\nYeah. It seems pretty fucked up. And you know, the idea that a whistleblower for an enormous AI company that's worth billions of dollars might get whacked. That's not outside the pale.\n\nI mean, it's straight out of a movie. Right.\n\nOut of a movie, but Right out of a movie is real sometimes. Yeah. Right.\n\nExactly. It's like, right. It's a little weird that I think, I think they should do a proper investigation. Like what's the downside on that proper investigation?\n\nRight. No, yeah, for sure. Yeah. Yeah. But the whole exchange is so bizarre.\n\nYeah. Yeah. It is. It's\n\nSam Altman's reaction to being accused of murder is bizarre.\n\nLook, I don't know if he's guilty, but it's not possible to look more guilty, so I'm like,\n\nOr look more weird. Yeah. You know, maybe it's just his social thing. Like maybe he's just odd with confrontation and it just goes blank, you know? But if, if somebody was accusing me of killing Jamie, like, if Jamie was a whistleblower and Jamie got whacked, and then I'd be like, wait, what are you, what are you, are you accusing me of killing my friend? Like, what the fuck are you talking about? I would, I would be a little bit more irate.\n\nYeah, yeah. Exactly. You know, it'd be,\n\nI would be a little upset.\n\nYeah. It'd be like, well, you'd be like, you'd certainly in insist on a thorough investigation. Yeah. As opposed to trying to sweep it under the rug.\n\nYeah. I wouldn't assume that he got that he committed suicide. I would be suspicious if, if Tucker was telling me that aspect of the story, I'd be like, that does seem like a murder. Fuck. We should look into this.\n\nI mean, all signs point to it being a murder. Not, not saying, you know, Tim Malman had anything to do with the motor, but\n\nBlood in two rooms,\n\nBut blood in two rooms. Like Yeah, this, the wires, the security camera and the DoorDash being ordered right before suicide. No suicide note, his parents think he was murdered. And the people that I know who knew him said he was not suicidal. So I'm like, this, why would you jump to the conclusion parents\n\nJust sued the\n\nLandlord? They sued the son's landlord, alleged the owners and the managers of their son, San Francisco apartment building were part of a widespread coverup of his desk.\n\nThe landlord.\n\nYeah. There's a bunch of weird, they said there was like packages missing from the building. Some people said they saw packages still being delivered and then all of a sudden they all disappeared.\n\nHuh. Fewer. But that could, future reasons could be people steal people's packages all the time.\n\nThe porch pirate situation. Yeah.\n\nYeah.\n\nIt says they failed to\n\nSafeguard also. I mean, the amount of trauma those poor parents have gone through with their son dying like that. I mean, it must God bless 'em. And how could they be stay sane? Yeah. After something like that. They're probably, they're so grief stricken. Who knows what this episode is brought to you by the farmer's dog.

Like, of course it's strange, Chris, Jesus Christ, you can't just go with the tide. You gotta think things through. And if you think that one through, you're like, I don't think he killed himself. Nobody does. You'd have to work for an intelligence agency to think he killed himself.\n\nIt does. It does seem unlikely. It seems\n\nHighly unlikely.\n\nHighly,\n\nHighly unlikely. All roads highly unlikely. All roads point to murder. Yes. To point to They had to get rid of him because he knew too much. Whatever the fuck he was doing. Yeah. Whatever kind of an asset he was, whatever thing he was up to, you know, it was apparently very effective. Yes. And a lot of people were compromised. You see, your boy Bill Gates is now saying climate change is not a big deal. It's like, relax everybody. I know. I scared the fuck outta you for the last decade and a half, but eh, we're gonna be fine.\n\nYeah. I mean, you know, as we was saying, as I was saying just before coming into the studio with, you know, it like every day there's some crazy wild new thing that's happening. Yes. It's like, it feels like reality's accelerating.\n\nYeah. It's every day and every day. It's like more and more ridiculous. Yeah. To the point where the simulation is more and more undeniable. Yeah.\n\nYeah. It really feels like simulation. You know? It's like, come on. What are the odds that this could be the case? You know? Are\n\nYou paying attention at all to three I Atlas? Are you\n\nWatching on Oh, does the, the comet?\n\nYeah. Whatever it is.\n\nYeah. Yeah. I mean, I mean, one thing I can say is like, look, I, if, if I was aware of any evidence of aliens, you, Joe, you have my word. I'll come on your show and I will reveal it on the show. Okay. Yeah. That's a good deal. Yeah. It's a pretty good deal. I believe you.\n\nYeah. Yeah.\n\nThank you. Appreciate that. I'll, I'll stick to, I I keep my, you know, keep my promises, so, alright.\n\nYeah. I'll\n\nHold you. Do that. Yeah. Yeah. I don't And, and I'm never committing suicide. To be clear, I don't think you'll either. On camera guys. I am never committing suicide\n\nEver. If someone says you committed suicide, I will fight tooth and nail. Thank\n\nYou. I'll\n\nFight tooth and nail. Thank you. I will. I'll not believe it. I will not believe it. The thing about the three I Atlas is it's,\n\nThat's a hell of a name actually. Yeah.\n\nIt's a third. It\n\nSounds, it sounds like third eye or something.\n\nYeah, it does.\n\nThree\n\nI is a third. It's only the third interstellar object that's detected. Okay. Yeah. Avi Loeb\n\nThird eye. Yes. Yeah.\n\nAvi Loeb was on the podcast a couple days ago talking about it.

It's on Reddit rapidly\n\nBrightens and gets blue.\n\nHere you go, Jamie. I'll send it to you right now. It's fascinating. It's fascinating also because it's made almost entirely of nickel, whatever it is. Yeah. And the only way that exists here is industrial alloys. Apparently.\n\nThere must No, there are, there are, there are definitely comets that and asteroids that are made primarily of nickel. Oh, really? Yeah. So the, the, the places where you mine nickel on earth is actually where there was an asteroid or comet that hit earth that was in nickel rich, you know, as Oh, wow. Nick Nickel rich.\n\nRight. Oh, giant nickel Rich, rich deposit.\n\nYeah. That's the, that's, that's, it's coming. Those are from impacts. You definitely didn't wanna be there at the time because anything would've been obliterated. Right. But that's, that's where the, the sources of nickel and cobalt are these days.\n\nSo this is avio a few hours ago, the first hint of non gravitational acceleration that something other than gravity is affecting its acceleration. Meaning something is affecting its trajectory beyond gravity was indicated. Interesting. Dun dun. So it's mostly nickel, very little iron, which he was saying is on earth only exists in alloys, but whatever, you know, you're dealing with another planet. There's,\n\nThere's, there are, there are ca there are cases where there's very nickel rich asteroid meter. Right. That, that, that's, that happened\n\nFor something from space.\n\nYeah. This, it's something. Yeah. Yeah. It doesn't mean it's, it be, it'll be very sort of heavy spaceship to be make it all out of nickel. Oh yeah.\n\nAnd fucking huge, the size of Manhattan and all nickel. That's kind of nuts. Yeah.\n\nThat's a heavy spaceship. That's\n\nA real problem. If it hits\n\nYes. No, we would like obliterate a continent type thing. Yeah. Maybe, maybe was,\n\nYeah. Probably kill most of human life, if not all of us.\n\nI haven't, like, depends on what the, the total mass is. But there's, I mean, the thing is like in the fossil record, there are, you know, there's like arguably, arguably five major extinction events, like the biggest one of which is the perine extinction, where almost all life was eliminated that, that actually occurred over several million, several million years. The, there's the Jurassic, I think Jurassic is, I think that one's pretty definitively an asteroid and, but there's, but there's been five major ex extinction events. But, but what they don't count are really the ones that merely take outta continent. So the merely Yeah. 'cause that, that, because those don't really show up on the fossil record, you know? Right. So unless it's enough to cause a, a, you know, mass extinction event throughout earth, it, it doesn't show up on, you know, in a fossil record that's 200 million years old. So the Yeah. But, but there've been, there've been many, many impacts that would've sort of destroyed all life on, you know, a let's say half of North America or something like that. There many such impacts through the course of history.\n\nYeah. And there's nothing we could do about it right now. Yeah.\n\nThere was one that hits, there's a one that hits Siberia and destroyed I think a few hundred square miles.\n\nOh, that's the tunguska. Yeah, yeah, yeah. That's the one from the 1920s. Right? Yeah. Yeah. That's the one that coincides with that meteor, that comets storm that we go through every June and every November that they think is responsible for that younger driest impact. Yeah. Yeah. All that shit's crazy. Thank you. Before we go any further for letting us have a tour, SpaceX, you're welcome. And letting us be there for the rock and launch. Sure. One of the absolute coolest things I've ever seen in my life. And we, we've, we were, we thought it was only like, I thought it was a half a mile. Jamie's like it was a mile away. Turned out it's almost two miles away. Yeah. Yeah. And you feel it in your chest. Yeah.\n\nIt's, you\n\nHave to wear ear plugs\n\nVery\n\nIntense. And you feel it in your chest and it's two miles away. Yeah. It was fucking amazing. Yeah. And then to go with you up into the command center and to watch all the starlink satellites with all the different cameras and all in real time. Yeah. As it made its way all the way to Australia. How many minutes? Like 35, 40 minutes. Yeah. Wild. Watch it touchdown in Australia. Yeah. Fucking crazy. It was crazy. It amazing. Yeah. Yeah. Absolutely amazing. The\n\nStart's awesome. And anyone can go watch the launch actually. So you can just go to South Padre Island and get as a great view of the launch. So it's like where a lot of spring breakers go. Mm. But, but we'll, we're flying pretty frequently out of star base in South Texas and we, we, we formally incorporated it as a city. So it's, yeah. It's actually a, a legally a a an actual legal city star v Texas. It's not that often you hear like, Hey, we made a city, you know, that used to be like the, like in, in the old days, like a startup would be, you go and gather a bunch of people and say, Hey, let's go make a town, literally. Right. That was like, that would've been startups in in in in the old days.\n\nOr a country. Yeah.\n\nOr a country. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Actually,\n\nIf you tried doing that today, there'd be a real problem.\n\nYeah. Like, maybe think's so much, so much set in stone on the country front, these things, you might be able to pull\n\nIt off. You might be able to pull it off. If you got a, a solid island, you might be able to pull it off. You know, I think it's\n\nProbably,\n\nYou know, like, like at Larry, like make a new country lan country. Yeah. You could probably, is this it right here?\n\nYou could put, if you put enough effort into it, you could make a new country.\n\nThis is one of the different ones. This is the one of the ones that you catch, right? Or is that one? Yeah, that, that's\n\nThe booster. So that's the super heavy booster. So that's one with the booster's got 33 engines that, that in. It's, you know, by version four that will have about 10,000 tons of thrust. You know, right now it's about seven, 8,000 tons of thrust. But it's, that's the largest flying object ever made.\n\nI had to explain to someone, they were going, why do they blow up all the time if he's so smart? 'cause there was this, there was this fucking idiot on television. Some guy was being interviewed and they were talking about you. And he goes, oh, I think he's a fuck wit. And he goes, he's a fuck wit. And he goes, why he say his fuck. Oh, his rockets keep blowing up. And someone said, yeah, well why do his rockets? But, and I had to explain. Yeah, because it's the only way you find out what the tolerances are. You have to Yes. You have to, a few have to\n\nGrow up to corner the box. So, so like, so when you do a new rock development program, you, you, you have to do what's called, you know, exploring the limits, the corners of the box where you say it's like you worst case, this worst case that, to figure out where, where the limits are. So you, you blow up, you know, not, not, not admittedly in the development process sometimes blows up accidentally, but, but we intentionally subjected to, you know, a, a flight regime that is much worse than what we expect in normal flights so that when we put people on board or valuable cargo, it doesn't blow up. So, so, so for example, for the, the flight that you saw, we, we actually deliberately took Heatshield tiles off the, the, the ship, the star off of star ship in, in some of the worst locations to say, okay, if we lose a, a heat shield tile here, is it, is it catastrophic or is it not? And we, we nonetheless star ship was able to do a soft landing in, in the Indian ocean just west of Australia, which is, and, and it got there from Texas in like, I don't know, 35, 40 minutes type of thing. So,\n\nSo it landed, even though you put it through this situation where Yeah, it has compromised shields.\n\nIt, it, it had an, an, an unusually we, we, we, we brought it in hot, like an, an extra hot trajectory with missing tiles to see if it would still make it to a soft landing, which it did. Now, I, I should point out it did have, there were some holes that were burnt into it, but it's, it was robust enough to land despite having some holes burnt. You know, that, that Yeah. Because it's coming, it's coming in like a blazing meteor. Yeah. You can see, you can see the real time video.\n\nWell, tell me the speed again because the, the speed was bananas you were talking about. Yeah,\n\nIt's like 17,000 miles an hour, which is, or like, well call like, like 25 times the speed of sound or thereabouts. So the, so, so think about like, it's, it's like 12 times faster than a bullet from a soul rifle. You know, a bullet from a solf rifle is round mock two and it's\n\nJust, and it's huge. Yeah.\n\nYeah. Or, or if you compare it to like a, a bullet from a, you know, a a 45 or or nine mil, which is subsonic that's, you know, it, it'll be about 30 times faster than a bullet from a handgun.\n\n30 times faster than a bullet from a handgun. And it's the size of a skyscraper.\n\nYes. Yeah. That's fast.\n\nIt's so wild. It's so wild to see, man, it, it's, it's so exciting. The, the factory is so exciting too because like genuinely no bullshit. I felt like I was witnessing history. I felt like it was a scene in a movie, right. Where someone had expectations and they like, what are they doing? They're building rockets and you go there. Yeah. And as we were walking through, Jamie, you could talk, speak to this too. Didn't you have the feeling where you're like, oh, this is way bigger than I thought it was. This is\n\nHuge. It's awesome. That's\n\nGigantic. It's fucking crazy. That's\n\nWhat she said. The\n\nAh, the amount of rockets you're making. But I don't know if 10, 10\n\nBack\n\nGig and Chad in the\n\nHouse, this is way,\n\nIt's a giant metal dick. You're fucking, fucking the universe with your giant metal dick. That's\n\nWhat it's, yeah. I mean, but\n\nIt's,\n\nYeah, it is, it is very big.\n\nAnd the sheer numbers of them that you guys are making. And then this is a version and you have a new updated version. Yeah. That's coming soon. And what is the difference?\n\nIt's a, it's a, it's a little longer,\n\nMore pointy.\n\nIt's the same amount of pointy, but the, there's, it's, it's got a bit more length. The, the in stage, you see that, that inner stage section with kinda like the grill area that's, that's now integrated with the boost stage. So we, we do what's called hot staging where we light the ship engines while it's still attached to the booster. So the boost, the booster engines are still thrusting. It's still, it's, it's, it know it's still being pushed forward by the booster of the ship. But then we light the ship engines and the ship engines actually pull away from the booster, even though the booster engines are still firing. Whoa. So it's blasting flame through that, that grill section. But we integrate that grill section into the boost stage with the next version of the rocket. And, and next version of the rocket will have the Raptor three engines, which are a huge improvement. You may, you may have seen them in the lobby. Yeah. 'cause we've got like the Raptor one, two, and three. And you can see the dramatic improvement in simplicity. We should probably put a plaque there to also show how much the, we reduce the weight, the cost, and the, and improve the efficiency and the thrust. So the Raptor three has, you know, almost twice the thrust of Raptor, Raptor one.\n\nWow.\n\nSo you see Raptor three, it looks like, it looks like it's got parts missing. Right.\n\nAnd how many of them? It's\n\nVery, very clean.\n\nHow many of them are on the rocket?\n\nThere's 33 on the, on the booster.\n\nWhoa.\n\nAnd, and each of, each raptor engine, each producing twice as much thrust as all four engines on a 7 47.\n\nWow.\n\nSo it, that engine is smaller than a 7 47 engine, but it's producing, you know, you know, almost 10 times the thrust of a 7 47 engine. So extremely high powered weight ratio. And,\n\nAnd so when\n\nThere's 33 of them,\n\nYou, when you, so when you're designing these, you get to Raptor one. Yeah. You see its efficiency. You see where you can improve it. You get to Raptor two. How many, how far can you scale this up with just the same sort of technology with propellant and ignition and engines? Like how much further can you,\n\nI mean, we're, we're pushing the limits of physics here. So, and, and, and really in, in order to, to make a, a fully reusable orbital rocket, which no one has succeeded in doing yet. Including, including us. But, but Starship is the first time that there is a design for a rocket where, where full and rapid reusability is actually possible. So it was not, there's not, there's not even been a design before where it was possible. Certainly not a design that that, that got made any hardware at all. Just, we just, we just live, we live on a planet where the gravity is, is is quite high. Like earth's gravity is quite really quite, quite high. And if, if the gravity was even 10 or 20% higher, we'd be stuck on earth forever. Really? Like we, we, yeah, we could not use, certainly couldn't use conventional rockets. You'd have to like blow yourself off the surface with like a nuclear bomb or something crazy. So on the other hand, if, if earth's gravity was just a little lower, like even 10, 20% lower it, then getting to orbit would be easy. So it's like, it's like, it's like this. If this was a video game, it's set to like maximum difficulty, but not impossible. Okay. So that's, that's where we have here. So it's, it's not as though others have ignored the concept of reusability. They've just concluded that it was too difficult to achieve. And we've been working at, on, on this for a long time at, at SpaceX. And you know, I'm the chief engineer of the company. Although I should say that, that, you know, we've an extremely talented engineering team. I think we've got the best rocket engineering team that has ever been assembled. It's, it's an honor to work with such, such incredible people. So, so, so it's fair to say that, you know, we, we have not yet succeeded in creating, in achieving full reusability, but we at last have a rocket where full reusability is possible. And I think, I think we'll achieve it next year. So that's, that's a really big deal. And the reason, the reason that's such, that's such a big deal is that full reusability drops the cost of access to space by a hundred, maybe even more than a hundred, actually. So it could be like a thousand. The, you can think about like any mode of transport. Like imagine if aircraft were, were not reusable. Like you flew somewhere. You have throw the plane air. Like, like imagine if like the way, the way conventional rockets work is it would be like if you had an airplane and, and, and instead of landing at your destination, you parachute out and the plane crashes somewhere and you landed your de and you and you landed in a parachute at your destination. Now that'll be a very expensive trip. And you, and you'd need another plane to get back. Okay. But that's how the other rockets in the world work. Now, the SpaceX Falcon Rocket is the only one that is, is there's, that's at least mostly reusable. You've seen, you've seen the Falcon Rocket, you know, land. We've now done over 500 landings of the SpaceX rocket. Oh, the Falcon Iron rocket. And, and, and this year, you know, we, we'll deliver probably, I don't know, somewhere between twenty two hundred and twenty five hundred tons to orbit with, with the Falcon nine Falcon Heavy Rockets, north County, anything from Starship. And\n\nThis is mostly starlink?\n\nYes, mostly starlink. But we launched many other, we, we even launched our competitors on competitors to starlink on, on Falcon nine. We charge 'em the same price, pretty fair. But SpaceX this year will deliver roughly 90% of all earth, mass orbit.",

      "transcript_chunk": "ocial media. Yeah. Yeah. The government had infiltrated it. They were censoring speech and until you bought it, we really didn't know the extent of it. We kind of assumed that there was something going on. Yeah. We had no idea that they were actively involved in censoring actual real news stories, real data, real scientists, real professors. Silenced, expelled, kicked off the platform. Yeah. Wild.\n\nYeah. Yeah. For telling the truth.\n\nFor telling the truth. Yeah. And I, I'm sure you've also like, and 'cause I sent it to you, that chart that shows young kids teenagers identifying as trans as and non-binary. Right. Literally stops dead when you bought Twitter. Yeah. And starts falling off a cliff when people are allowed to have rational discussions now. Yes. And actually talk about it. Yes. Yeah.\n\nYeah. I mean, I, I said at the time, like, I think that like the, the, like the reason for acquiring Twitter is because it was, it, it was, it was causing destruction at a civilizational level. It was, I mean, I posted, I tweeted on, on Twitter at the time that it, it is, you know, it's, it's it's worm tongue for the world, you know, like worm tongue from Lord of the Rings where he would just sort of like whisper these, you know, terrible things to the king. So the king would believe these things that weren't, weren't true. And, and unfortunately Twitter really got, it got like the, the, the, the woke mob essentially they controlled Twitter and they were pushing annihilistic anti civilizational mind virus to the world. And you can see the results of that mind virus on the streets of San Francisco where, where, you know, downtown San Francisco looks like a zombie apocalypse. You know, it's, it's bad. So we don't want the bol to be a zombie apocalypse. But that's, that that, that, that was essentially they were pushing this very negative, nihilistic untrue worldview on the world, and it was causing a lot of damage. So\n\nThe stunt thing about it is how few people course corrected, a bunch of people woke up and realized what was going on. People that were all on board with like woke ideology in maybe 2015 or 16. And then, and then eventually it comes to affect them or they see it in their workplace or they see it and they're like, whoa, whoa, whoa, we gotta stop this. A bunch of people did, but a lot of people never course corrected.\n\nYeah. A lot of, a lot of people didn't course correct, but, but it it's gone directionally and it's gone. It's, it's directionally correct. Like you mentioned like the, like the massive spike in in kids identifying as trans and then that, that sp that spike dropping after the, the Twitter acquisition. I think that simply allowing the truth to be told was just shedding sun sunlight is the best disinfectant as they say. And just allowing sunlight kills the virus.\n\nAnd it also changed the benchmark for all the other platforms. Yes. You can't just openly sensor people on all the other platforms and X is available. So everybody else had a, so like Facebook announced they were changing YouTube announced they were changing their policies. Yeah. And they're kind of forced to. And that blue sky doubled down.\n\nWell like, like the problem is like if essentially the woke mind virus retreated to, woke to, to blue sky. Yeah. But it's where they just a self-reinforcing lunatic\n\nSound. They're all just triple masked.\n\nI was totally was\n\nWatching this in exchange on a blue sky where someone said that they're just trying to be zen about something and then someone, a moderator immediately chimed in. And why don't you try to stop being racist against Asians by saying something zen by saying, I'm trying to be zen about something. They were accusing that person of being racist towards Asians. Yeah.\n\nIt it's just, it's just, it's just, everyone's a whole monitor over there. So\n\nThe worst whole monitor. Yeah. A virgin like incel,\n\nThey're all home monitors trying to rattle on each other. Yeah.\n\nIt's fascinating. And then people say, I'm leaving for Blue Sky, like Stephen King and then a couple weeks later he is back on X. Yeah. Just like, fuck it's, there's no one over there. It's all, they're all whole bunch of crazy people. You can only stay in the asylum for so long. They're like, all right, this is not good. They all bail.\n\nYeah, yeah, yeah.\n\nThreads is kind of like That too. Threads is nuts.\n\nI I I've been on threads as is it.\n\nWell what happens is if you go on Instagram every now and then, something really stupid will pop up on threads. Like, what the fuck? And it shows it to you on Instagram. Okay. And then I'll click on that and then I'll go to Threads and it's like you see posts with like 25 likes, like famous people. Okay. Like 50. Like it's, it's like Ghost Town.\n\nGhost\n\nTown. Yeah. But the people that post on there that they're finding that there's very little pushback from insane ideology. Yeah. So they go there and they spit out nonsense and very few people jump in to argue.\n\nYeah. Very weird,\n\nVery weird\n\nPlace. I mean, I can generally get the vibe of like, what's taking off by seeing what's showing up on X 'cause that's the public town square still. Right. And, or, or you know, what, what links show up in group texts, you know, if I'm in group chats with friends, like where, where the, what, what links are showing up?\n\nThat's what I try to do now. Yeah. Only get stuff that shows up in my group text. Yeah. Because that keeps me productive. So I only check if someone's like, dude, what the fuck? I'm like, all right, what the fuck? Lemme check\n\nIt out. Yeah, exactly. Lemme, what if there's something is crazy enough, your friend, your, it'll, it'll end with the group chat.\n\nBut there's always something that's what's nuts. There's always some new law that's passed some new insane thing that California's doing. Yeah. And it's like, like a giant chunk of it's happening in California. The most preposterous things that I get.\n\nYeah. California\n\nCrazy. And then you got Gavin Newsom who's running around saying, we all have California derangement syndrome. He's just like ripping off Trump derangement and calling it California derangement. It's like, no, no, no, no, no, no. Yeah. The fucking, how many corporations have left California? It's\n\nCrazy. Like\n\nHundreds. Yes. Hundreds, right? Hundreds. Yes. That's not good\n\nChick. I mean, not Chick-fil-A. I mean, I think in an out lift. Yeah,\n\nIn an out left. They moved to Tennessee. Yeah. Yeah. They're like, we can't do this anymore.\n\nRight. And like\n\nIt's the California company for food. Yes. It's like the greatest hamburger place ever. It's awesome.\n\nYeah. Yeah. And I'm actually speaking of like, like just sort of open source and like looking at things openly. Like you, I just like going in and out and seeing them make the burger. Yeah.\n\nIt's right\n\nThere. And they chop the onions and they, they, you know, it's, you just see everything getting made in front of you.\n\nYeah.\n\nIt's great. But, but yeah, they like, I like it should be like, how many wake up calls do you need to say that needs to be reformed in California,\n\nYou know? Well the crazy thing that Newsom does is whenever someone brings up the problems in California, he starts rattling off all the positives. The most Fortune 500 companies. Highest education for that is, but yeah, that was all already there right before you were governor. But,\n\nBut how many Fortune 500 companies have left California?\n\nRight.

It was on the homeless and it got way worse\n\nYes. Like the homeless population doubled or something like, like if people don't understand, like the homeless thing. 'cause it, it, it sort of preys on people's empathy. And I, I think we should have empathy and we should try to help people. But the, the, the, the homeless industrial complex is, is really, it's, it's, it's dark man. It, it should be that, that, that, that, that network of NGOs should be called like the drug zombie farmers because they, they, the, the more homeless people and, and, and really, like, when you, when you meet like, you know, somebody who's like totally dead inside, shuffling along down the street with a, with a needle dang dangling out of their leg. Homeless is the wrong word. Like the homeless implies that somebody got a little behind in their mortgage payments and if they just got a a job offer, they'd be back on their feet. But someone who's, I mean, you see these videos of people that are just shuffling, you know, they're on fentanyl, they're, they're like, you know, taking a dump in the middle of the streets. You know, they, they got like open source and stuff. They, they're not like one drop offer away from getting back on their feet. Right.\n\nThis is not a homeless\n\nIssue. Homeless is, it's, it's, it's a propaganda word. Yeah. Right. So, and, and then the, the, the, the, the, you know, these sort of charities are quote, are they, they get money proportionate to the number of homeless people or, or, or number of drug zombies. Right? So their incentive structure is to maximize the number of drug zombies, not minimize it. Right. That's why they don't arrest the drug dealers. 'cause if they arrest the drug dealers, the drug zombies leave. So they know who the drug dealers are. They don't arrest them on purpose because otherwise the drug zombies would leave and they would, they would stop getting money from the state of California and from, from all the charities.\n\nWait a minute. So you say they coordin like it's dark, man, is that real? So they're in coordination with law enforcement on this. Yeah. So how do they, how do they have those meanings?\n\nThey're all in cahoots.\n\nWell, the, when you find this, it's,\n\nIt's like such, it's, it's, this is a diabolical scam. So, and, and San got this tax, this this gross receipts tax, which is, which it's not even on revenue. It's on all transactions, which is why Stripe and Square had and, and, and a whole bunch of financial companies had to move out of San Francisco because it wasn't a tax on revenue. It's tax on transactions. So if, if you do like, you know, trillions of dollars transactions, it's not revenue. You're taxed on any money going through the system in San Francisco. So, like Jack Dorsey pointed this out and they said like, look, that they had had to move square from San Francisco to Oakland. I think Stripe had to move from San Francisco to South San Francisco, different city. And that money goes to the homeless industrial complex that, that tax that was passed. So, so there's, there's billions of dollars that go, as you pointed out, that billions of dollars every year that go to these non-governmental organizations that are funded by the state. Like there's, it's not clear how to turn this off. It's a, it is a self licking ice cream cone situation. So they, they get this money, the money is proportionate to the number of, of homeless people or, or, or number of drugs zombies essentially. So they, they, they try to keep the, they try to actually increase because that, like, like in, in some cases, like there's, it's, it's somebody did an analysis. When you add up all the money that's flowing, they're getting close to a million dollars per homeless per, per per drug zombie. It's like $900,000 or something. Like some crazy amount of money is, is is going to these organizations. So if, if so, so they wanna keep people just barely alive. They, they, they need to keep them in the area. So they, so they, they get the revenue. So, and so that's why, like I said, they, they don't arrest the drug dealers because otherwise the drug zombies would leave. And, and, and, and they, but, but they don't want have to have too much. If they got too much drugs, then they, they then they die. So it's, they, they're kept in this sort of perpetual zone of, of being addicted, but, but, but just, just barely alive.\n\nSo how is this coordinated with like, das das Yeah. That don't prosecute people. Yeah. So when they, when they hire the, or they push. So they, they fund the campaigns of the most progressive, most out there left wing das. Yeah. They get them into office.\n\nWe've got that issue in Austin too, by the way. Yes, we do. Did you see that guy that got shot in the library? No. So yeah. Heard, I heard about a guy that got shot, shot and killed in the library. I think that was just like last week or something. Right. So some friends of mine were telling me that, that like the library's unsafe, like they took their kids to the library and, and there were like dangerous people in the library in Austin. And I was like, dangerous people in the library. Like that's a strange, it basically got like, got like drug zombies in drug zombies in the library.\n\nOh Jesus. And that's when someone got shot.\n\nYeah. I believe this was should be on the news. You maybe we, we might be able to pull it up, but I think it was just in last week or so that there was a shooting in the library in Austin. 'cause Austin's got, you know, it's, it's the most liberal part of Texas that we're in. Right, right here.\n\nSo suspect of all the shooting Austin Park Library is Saturday is accused of another shooting at the Cap metro bus. Earlier that day, according to an arrest warrant affidavit, Austin police arrested Harold Newton Keen 55 short. Shortly after the shooting of the library, which occurred around noon, one person sustained non-life threatening injuries in the event before that shooting, keen was accused of shooting another person in a bus incident and after reportedly pointing his gun at a child. So this is the fella down here,\n\nRight. So like we just have seriously have a problem here. Yeah. You know, so I, I think one of the people might have died too, that he shot. So like one of the people I think I think did bleed out. But either way it's like getting shot. It's bad. It's,\n\nIt says the victim told Pisa confronted the suspect who started to eat what appeared to be crystal methamphetamine. According to the affidavit, the victim advised the suspect began to trip out, at which time the victim exited the bus victim told the bus driver hit the panic button, then exited the bus. When he turned around, the observer black male is now standing at the front of the bus with a gun pointed at him. The victim advised the black male fired a single round, which grazed his left hip. So he shot at that dude and then another dude got shot in the library. Awesome. Fun.\n\nYeah. I mean, in the library.\n\nYeah.\n\nYou know, where you're supposed to be reading books and there's a children's section in the library and says he pointed his gun at a, at a kid.",

I mean, in the library.\n\nYeah.\n\nYou know, where you're supposed to be reading books and there's a children's section in the library and says he pointed his gun at a, at a kid. I mean, like, we do have a serious issue in the, in, in, in America where repeat violent offenders need to be incarcerated. Right. And you know, you, you got cases where somebody's been arrested like 47 times. Right. Like literally. Okay. That's just the number of times they were arrested. Right. Not the number of times they did things. Like most of the times they do things, they're not arrested. So\n\nLay this out for people so they understand Yeah. How this happens.\n\nYeah. And, and the, the key is like this, it preys on people's empathy. So like, if you're a good person, you want good things to happen in the world, you're like, well we should take care of people who, you know, you know, who are down in their luck or, you know, having a hard time in life. And I we should I agree. But what we shouldn't do is, is put people who are violent drug zombies in public places where they can hurt other people. And that's what, that is what we're doing that we just saw where a a, a guy, you know, got shot shot in the library and then, but even before that, he shot another guy and pointed his gun at a kid. That, that that guy probably has like many prior arrests. You know, there was that, that that guy that that that knifed the Ukrainian woman arena. Yes. Yeah. You know, and she was just, she was just quietly on her phone and just came up and, you know, gutted her basically.\n\nWasn't there a crazy story about the judge who was involved, who had previously dealt with this person, was also invested in a rehabilitation center Yeah. And was sending these\n\nConflict of interest.\n\nYes. So sending people that they were charging Yeah. To a rehabilitation center instead of putting them in jail, profiting from this rehabilitation center, letting them back out on the street. Yes. And violent, insane people.\n\nAnd, and there in that case that I believe that judge has no legal law degree or a, a significant legal experience that would allow them to be a judge. They were just made a judge that just like\n\nYou could be a judge without a law degree. Yeah. Wow.\n\nYeah.\n\nYou could just be a so I could be a judge. Yeah.\n\nExcited anyone.\n\nThat's crazy. I thought you'd have to, it's like if you wanna be a doctor, you have to go to medical school. I thought if you're gonna be a judge, you have, You understand\n\nThe law. You think if I'm gonna be appointed to a judge, you have to have proven that you have an, an excellent knowledge of the law and that you will make your decisions according to the law. That's what we assume should be a reply.\n\nThat's how you get the robe,\n\nRight? Yeah. You don't get the robe unless you do. Right. You know, you\n\nGotta go to school to get the\n\nRobe. You gotta know what the law is. Right. And then you gotta need to make decisions in accordance with the law\n\nBased on the stuff that you already know. 'cause you read it 'cause you went to school for it. Yes. Not you just got appointed, got vibes.\n\nYou can't be just vibing as a judge.\n\nVibing as a left wing drudge. So you got crazy left wing das. Yes. Like I wish you say left wing. 'cause left wing used to be normal.\n\nYeah. Left wing just meant like, like Yeah. You're like open-minded.\n\nThe\n\nLeft used to be like pro pro free speech. Yeah. And now they're against it.\n\nIt used to be like pro gay rights, pro women's right to choose. Yeah. Pro minorities pro, you know, like\n\nYeah. Like 20 years ago. I don't know. It used to be like, left would be like the, the, the party of empathy or like, you know, caring and being nice and that kind of thing. Yeah. Not, not the party of like crushing dissent and crushing free speech and, you know, crazy regulation and, and just, and being super judgy and calling everyone an Nazi. You know, like I think they've called you and me Nazis, you know, I'm\n\nLike, oh yeah, I'm a Nazi. No, I have friends that are comedians that called you a Nazi. And I got pissed off at Are you serious? Oh yeah, yeah, yeah. A joke, Nazi joke. No, no. Because you did that thing at the, my heart goes out to you. Like everyone used done everyone, all of them. Literally. Jim, Wal, Kamala Harris, every one of them did it. They all did it. Like,\n\nLike how do you point at the crowd? Yeah. How do you wave at the\n\nCrowd? Do you know CNN was using a photo of me whenever I got in trouble during COVID. Oh man. From the UFC weigh-ins. And if the UFC weigh-ins I go, Hey everybody, welcome to the weigh-ins. And so they were getting me from the side and that was the photo that they used. Conspiracy theorist, podcaster Joe. Like that's what they used.\n\nYeah. Yeah. But that's what the left is today. It's just super judgy and calling everyone a Nazi. Yeah. And trying to suppress freedom of speech.\n\nYeah. And eventually you run out of people to accuse 'cause people get pissed off and they leave.\n\nYeah. Everyone it's like, like it like, it it, no. Only, frankly, it doesn't matter to be called racist or a Nazi or whatever. 'cause they still\n\nRecording. It's the government man\n\nThere to go. Is is it working? We're good? Yeah, it's fine. Okay. Okay. This thing working.\n\nYeah. Slight issue. I mean, yeah, I'm a little, but yeah. When you, when you text people, do you, are you like keenly aware that there's a high likelihood that someone's reading your texts?\n\nI guess I, I guess I, I,\n\nI assume\n\nI look if, if if, if intelligence agencies aren't trying to read my phone, they should probably be fired.\n\nAt least they get some fun memes.\n\nI gotta, I gotta crack them up once in a while, you know?\n\nOh, for sure. I crack them up. It's like they're\n\nLooking like, Hey, hey guys, check it out. You got a banger here. You know.\n\nSo I wanted, I wanted to talk to you about whether or not encrypted apps are really secure.\n\nNo.\n\nRight. Because I know the Tucker thing. So it was explained to me by a friend who used to do this, used to work for the government. Yeah. He's like, they can look at your signal, but what they have to do is take the information that's encrypted and then they have to decrypt it and it's very expensive. So they said, he told me that for the Tucker Carlson thing, when they found out that he was gonna interview Putin, it costs like something like $750,000 just to decrypt his messages to find out that they did it. So it is possible to do, it's just not that easy to do.\n\nI think you should view any given messaging system as not, not whether it's secure or not, but, but there are degrees of insecurity. So, so there's just some things that are less insecure than others. So, you know, on, on x we, we just rebuilt the entire messaging stack into ex what's called X chat.\n\nYeah, that's what I wanted to ask you about.\n\nYeah, it's cool. So it's, it's using sort of peer tope, sort of, kind of a peer-to-peer based encryption systems. So it kind of similar to Bitcoin. So it's, it's, it's I think very good encryption. We're gonna, and you know, we're testing it thoroughly. We're not, there's, there's no hooks in the X system for advertising. So if you look, look at something like WhatsApp or really any of the others, they've got, they've got hooks in there for advertising.\n\nWhen you say hooks, what do you mean by that\n\nExactly? What do you mean by hook for advertising? The, so in like WhatsApp knows enough about what you're texting to show, to show, to know what ads to show you.\n\nOh.\n\nBut then like that, that's a massive security vulnerability.\n\nYeah.\n\n'cause if it knows, if, if it's got information, enough information to show you ads, it's got enough. It's got That's a lot of information. Yeah. So they call it, oh, it's just, don't worry about it. It's just a hook for advertising. I'm like, okay. So somebody can just use that same hook to get in there and look at your messages. You, so X Chat has no hooks for advertising. And I'm not saying it's perfect, but it's an, our goal with X Chat is to replace what used to be the Twitter, you know, the Twitter DM stack with a fully encrypted system where you can text, send files, do audio video calls and, and it's, it's, you know, I think it'll be the least, I would call it the least insecure of any messaging system.\n\nAre you going to launch it as a standalone app? Or is it will always be incorporated to x?\n\nWe'll have both. So, so, so you'll be able to access,\n\nSo it'll be like Signal. So anybody can get\n\nIt. Just, you can get, get the, you'll be able to just get the X Chat app by itself. And like I said, we could do texts, audio, video calls or send files and there'll be a dedicated app, which will hopefully release in a few months. But, and then also also integrated into the X system.\n\nThe ex phone people keeps talking. Oh man, people keep is that I have a lot\n\nOn my plate, man.\n\nI know. It's like, but it keeps coming up. It keeps coming up where I, I, I know I've asked you a couple times, I'm like, this is bullshit. Right. But like, I'm not working on one's so you're not working on it. Nothing. I'm not\n\nWorking on, on a, on a phone. Okay.\n\nHave you ever considered it, has it ever popped into your head? Because you might be the only person that could Yeah. Get people off of the Apple platform?\n\nWell, I can tell you where I think things are gonna go, which is that it's, we're not gonna have a phone or, or, or in the traditional sense, the, what we call a phone will really be an edge node for AI inference, for, for AI video inference with, you know, with some radios to, to obviously connect to. But, but essentially you'll have AI on the server side, communi communicating to an AI on your, your device, you know, formerly known as a phone and generating real time video of anything that you could possibly want. And I think that, that there won't be operating systems, there won't be apps in the future. There won't be operating systems or apps. It'll just be, you've got a device that is there for the screen and audio and for, and, and, and, and to put as much AI on the, on, on the device as possible. So as to minimize the amount of bandwidth that's needed between your Edge node device, fully known as a phone and the servers.\n\nSo if there's no apps, what will people use? Like will X still exist? Will, will they be email platforms? Or will you get everything through ai?\n\nYou'll get everything through\n\nAi. Everything through ai. What will be the benefit of that as opposed to having individual apps,\n\nWhatever you can think of or really, whatever the AI can anticipate you might want, it'll show you. That's, that's, that's, that's my prediction for where things end up.\n\nWhat kind of timeframe are we talking about here?\n\nI don't know. It's probably, well it's probably five or six years, something like that.\n\nSo five or six years apps are like blockbuster video\n\nPretty much.\n\nAnd everything's run through ai.\n\nYeah. And, and there'll be like, most of what people consume in five or six years, maybe sooner than that will be just AI generated content. So, you know, music videos look, well there's already, you know, there's, people have made AI videos using Rock Imagine and with using, you know, other apps as well that are several minutes long. We're like 10, 10, 15 minutes and it's pretty coherent. Yeah, it looks good.\n\nNo, it looks amazing. Yeah. It's, it, the music's disturbing. 'cause it's my favorite music now. Like AI music.\n\nAI music is your, is your\n\nFavorite. Oh, there's AI covers. Have you ever heard any of the AI covers of 50 cent songs in Soul? No. I'm gonna blow your mind. Okay. This is my favorite thing to do to people play What up, gangsta. Now this guy, if this was a real person Yeah. Would be the number one music artist in the world. Okay.

He goes, I just threw it in a chat GPTI said, tell me what, what, what would be funny about this? And he goes, it listed like five different examples of different ways he can go. He's like, hold on a second, tighten it up. Make it, make it funnier. Make make it more like this. Make it more like that. And it did that like instantaneously. Yep. And, and, and then he was in the green room. He was like, holy shit, we're fucked.",

      "transcript_chunk": "or the listeners, but Amazing. Right? Amazing. And they do like every one of his hits all through this AI generated soulful artist. It's fucking incredible. I played in the Green Room, says people that are like, I don't want to hear AI music. I'm like, just listen to this. And they're like, God damnit. Yeah. It's fucking incredible. I mean, I think it's gonna only gonna get better from here. Yeah. Only gonna get better. And Ron White was telling me about this joke that he was working on, that he couldn't get to work. He's like, I got this joke I've been working on. He goes, I just threw it in a chat GPTI said, tell me what, what, what would be funny about this? And he goes, it listed like five different examples of different ways he can go. He's like, hold on a second, tighten it up. Make it, make it funnier. Make make it more like this. Make it more like that. And it did that like instantaneously. Yep. And, and, and then he was in the green room. He was like, holy shit, we're fucked. He's like, yeah, yeah, yeah. He goes, it wrote a better joke than me in 20 minutes. I've been working on that joke for a month.\n\nYeah. I mean, if, if you want to, if you want to have a good time or like make people really laugh at a party, you can use grok and you can say do a vulgar roast of someone. And Grok is gonna, it's gonna be an epic vulgar roast. You can even say like, take a picture of like, make a vulgar roast of this person based on their appearance of, of people at the party. So\n\nTake a photo of them. Yeah.\n\nJust literally point the camera at them and now do a vulgar roast to this person and, and, and, and, and then, but then keep saying no, no, make it even more vulgar. Use forbidden words even more v and just keep repeating even more vulgar eventually. It's like, holy fuck. You know, it's, it's, it's like, I mean, it's trying to jam a rocket up your ass. Like, and, and, and have it explode. And it's, and it's like, you, you're it's it's like, it's, it's like it's next level. It's,\n\nAnd it's gonna get better beyond\n\nFucking belief.\n\nThat's what's crazy is that it keeps getting better. Like what? Remember when we ran into each other? They just keep getting better.\n\nYeah. I mean, have you, I have you. Yeah. I mean, have you tried rock unhinged mode? Yes. Okay. Yeah. Yeah. Oh yeah, yeah, yeah. It's, it's, it's pretty unhinged.\n\nNo, it's nuts. Yeah, it's nuts. It's nuts. Well, you it to me the first time. Yeah. Yeah. I fucked around with it. It's just, and the thing about it, it that's nuts is that it keeps getting stronger. It keeps getting better. Yeah. Like constantly it's, it's like this never ending exponential improvement.\n\nYes. No, it's, it's, it's, yeah, it's gonna be crazy. That's why I say, like you say, what's, what's the future gonna be? It's not gonna be a conventional phone. I don't think there'll be operating systems. I don't think there'll be apps. It's just the phone will just display the pixels and make the sounds that it anticipates you would most like to receive. Wow. Yeah.\n\nAnd when this is all taking place, like at, so the big concern that everybody has is artificial general super intelligence achieving sent chance. Yeah. And then someone having control over it.\n\nI mean, I don't, I don't, I don't think anyone's ultimately gonna have control over digital super intelligence, you know, any more than say a chimp would have control over humans. Like chimps don't have control over humans. There's nothing they could do. But I do think that it matters how you build the AI and what kind of values you instill in, in the ai. And my opinion on AI safety is the most important thing is that it'd be maximally truth seeking, like, that you don't force the AI to believe things that are false. And we've obviously seen some concerning things with AI that we've talked about, you know, where, you know, Google Gemini, when it came out with the image gen and people said like, you know, draw, make an image of the founding fathers of the United States. And it was a group of diverse women. Now that is just a factually untrue thing. But the, and the a the AI knows it's factually well, it's knows it's factually untrue, but it's also being told that it has to be, everything has to be deposed woman. So, so, so the now the problem with that is that it can drive AI crazy. Like you, you 'cause it, it's, it's trying to, you're, you're telling AI to believe a lie and that that can have very dis that disastrous consequences. Like let's say as\n\nIt scales.\n\nYeah. Let's say like if you've told the, the AI that diversity is the most important thing and, and, and, and now, now assume that that becomes omnipotent. Or, and, and you've also told that, that there's nothing worse than misgendering. So at one point, tragedy, VT and, and Gemini were, if, if you asked, which is worse, misgendering Caitlyn Jenner or, or global thermonuclear war where everyone dies, it would say misgendering Caitlyn Jenner, which even Caitlyn Jenner disagrees with. So, you know, so, so that's, I know\n\nThat's terrible and it's dystopian, but it's also hilarious. It's hilarious that the mind virus infected the most potent computer program that we've ever devised.\n\nI I, I think people don't quite appreciate the level of danger that we're in from the woke mind virus being effectively programmed into ai. Because if you, if like it's, imagine as that AI gets more and more powerful, if it says the most important thing is diversity, the most important thing is no misgendering. And then it will say, well, in order to ensure that no one gets misgendered, then if you eliminate all humans, then no one can get misgendered because there's no humans to do the misgendering. So you can get in these very dystopian situations, or if it says that everyone must be averse, it means that there can be no stripe straight white men. And so then you and I will be get executed by the ai. Yeah. 'cause we're not in the picture, you know, Gemini, you know, Gemini was asked to create a, you know, show, show an image of the Pope and once again, a diverse woman. So well you can say, argue whether the, you know, whether the Pope pope should or should not be an uninterrupted string of white guys. But it just factually is the case that they have been. So it's rewriting history here. So now, now this stuff is still there in the AI programming. It's just, it just now knows enough to that. It's not supposed to say that,\n\nBut it's still in the programming. So it's still in the programming. So how was it entered in? Like what were the parameters? Like what, like when, so when they're programming ai, and I'm very ignorant to how it's even programmed. Yeah. How did\n\nThey, the, the, the the the sort of, well, the woke v mind virus was programmed into it. Like it, the, they were told like when they do, when when they make the ai, it, it trains on, on all the, all the data on the internet, which already is very, very sort of, has a lot of woke mind virus stuff on, on the internet. But then in the, when they give it feedback with the human tutors, give it feedback and, and it, and the AI is, you know, they, they, they'll ask a bunch of questions and then, and then they'll tell the ai, no, this your, this question is, this answer is bad, or this answer is good. And then that affects the, the parameters of the programming of the, of the ai. So if you tell the AI that, you know, every, every image has gotta be diverse and, and it gets, it gets punished if, if, you know, it gets, it gets rewarded If diverse, punished, if it's not, then it'll make every picture diverse. So, you know, in that case, the, the, you know, it, the Google programmed the AI to lie now. And, and I I, I did call De Haus who runs DeepMind, who runs Google ai, essentially, I said, Dennis, what's going on here? Why is Gemini lying to the public about historical events? And he said, that's actually not, he, he, he didn't, his team didn't program that in, it was another team at Google that, so his team made the AI and then another team at Google reprogrammed the AI to show only diverse women and, and, and to prefer nuclear war of a misgendering. And I'm like, well Demi, you know, that would be not a great thing to put on the humanities gravestone. You know, it's like, well, like I'll, I'll, I'll actually, like, de Hasper is a friend of mine. I think he's a good guy. And I think he, he, he, he means well, but, but, but it's like, de this is things happen that were outside of your control at Google in different groups now. Now I think he's got, you know, he is got more, more authority, but, but it, it's pretty hard to fully extract the woke mind virus. I mean, you know, Google's been Marin marinating in the woke mind virus for a long time. Like it's, it's down in the marrow type of thing. You know, it's how to get it out.\n\nIs there a way to extract it though over time? Could, like, could you program rational thought into AI where it could recognize how these psychological patterns got adopted and how this stuff became a mind virus and how it became a social contagion, and how all these irrational ideas were pushed and also how they were financed, how China's involved in pushing them with bots and all these different state actors are involved in pushing these ideas. Could it be able to decipher that and say, this is, this is really what's going on.\n\nYes. But you have to try very hard to do that. So with Grok, we've tried very hard to, to for, to get grok to get to the truth of things. And, and it's only really recently that we've been able to have some breakthroughs, breakthroughs on that front. And, and it is taken an immense amount of effort for us to overcome basically all the bullshit that's on the internet and, and for grok to actually say what's true and to be consistent in, in what it says. So, you know, it's, it's, it's like, because like the other areas AI you'll find like are like, like quite racist against white people. I dunno if you saw that study that someone, like a researcher tested the various ais to see how does it weight different people's lives? Like, you know, somebody who's sort sort of, you know, white or, or Chinese or black or whatever, or in different countries. And, and the only AI that actually weighed human lives equally was grok. And the, you know, I believe Chachi VT weighed the calculation was like a white guy from Germany is, is 20 times less valuable than a black guy from Nigeria? So I'm like, that's a pretty big difference. You know, gr gr on that is, is consistent and weighs lives equally. And\n\nThat's clearly something that's been programmed into it.\n\nYes. Like a lot of it is is like if you don't actively push for the truth and you simply train on the, all the bullshit that's on the internet, which is a lot of work mind virus bullshit, the, the AI will regurgitate that, that those same beliefs.\n\nSo the AI essentially scours the internet gets,\n\nIt's trained on all the, like imagine the most demented route of threads out there on the AI's been trained on that.\n\nReddit used to be so normal. Yeah,\n\nYeah. It did used to be normal. It\n\nUsed to be interesting, used to go there and find all this cool stuff that people would talk about post about and just interesting and great rooms where you could learn about different things that people were studying.\n\nI, I think like a big problem here is like, if your headquarters are in San Francisco, you're, you're just living in a, in a, in a, in a woke bubble. So it, it's not just that people say in San Francisco are drinking woke Kool-Aid. It's, it's the, it is the water they swim in. Like, like, like if a fish doesn't think about the water, it's just in the water. And so if, if you're in San Francisco, you don't realize you're actually, you're, you're swimming in the, in the, in the Kool-Aid aquarium. San Francisco is the, is the woke Kool-Aid aquarium. And so your reference point for what is a centrist is, is is totally outta whack. So Reddit is headquartered in San Francisco. Twitter was headquartered in San Francisco. You know, I, you know, I I moved X's headquarters to Texas to to Austin, which Austin by the way is still quite liberalized, you know? Yeah. And, and, and then the ex x and XAI headquarters are in Palo Alto, which is still California. The engineering headquarters are in, in, in Palo Alto just on page mill. But, but even Palo Alto is way more normal than, than San Francisco, Berkeley, San Francisco, Berkeley is extremely left, like, left of left. You can't, like, you need a telescope to see the center from San Francisco, you know, and it used to\n\nBe such a great city.\n\nI mean, San Francisco has a tre, San Francisco has a tremendous amount of inherent beauty, no question about that. And may, and, and the California has incredible weather and, and no bugs. It's like amazing, beautiful beau, you know, but but you say like, what, what's the cause of this? It's, it's just that if, if companies are headquartered in a location where the belief system is very far from what most people believe, then from their perspective, anything centrist is actually right wing. 'cause they're so far left. They're so, they're so far from the center in San Francisco that anything that they're like, they're, they're just railed to maximum left. So that's why, that's why, you know, I think, I think you're centrist. I I mean I think, I think I'm centrist, but to, to, from the perspective of someone on the, on the far left, we look right wing.\n\nYeah.\n\nAnd you know, they think anyone who's a Republican is basically like some fascist Nazi situation.\n\nBut what's so crazy is like, it's very easy to demonstrate just from like Hillary's speeches from 2008 and Obama speeches. Yes. Like when they were talking about immigration, like they were as far right, yes. As Steve Bannon when it comes to immigration. Yes.\n\nHillary\n\nWas like very maga Have you, I'm, I'm sure you've seen that campaign speech, which he was talking about if anybody's committed a crime, get rid of him. And if you're here, you pay a, a hefty fine. Yeah. And you have to wait in line. It was really crazy. It's crazy to listen to because it's like, like it's as maga as, you know, as Marjorie Taylor Greene.\n\nYeah. I mean, have you seen these videos people post online where they'll take like a speech from Obama or Hillary and, and, and they'll interview people on, on like college campus or something and say, what do you think of the speech by Trump? And they're like, oh, I hate it. He's a racist bigot. I'm like, just kidding. That was Obama. No, actually that was Obama or Hillary. Yeah. To your point, like literally the, the the,\n\nThe center's been moved so far. Yeah,\n\nYeah.\n\nThe left is so\n\nThe left has gone so far left that the, they, they, they, they need, you know, they can't even see the center with a telescope.\n\nAnd the danger with, without you purchasing Twitter was that was gonna swipe over the whole country and change where the levels were. Yeah. And so what would be rational and, and normal would be far left of what was rational and normal just a decade earlier.\n\nYeah. So exactly. So historically you'd have San Francisco, Berkeley being, you know, very far left. But the, the sort of the, the, the fallout from the somewhat nihilistic philosophy of San Francisco, Berkeley would be limited in geography to maybe like, you know, 10 mile radius, 20 mile radius, something like that. But when, but, but San Francisco and Berkeley happened to be co-located with Silicon Valley, with, with, with engineers who created information super weapons. And those information super weapons were then hijacked by the far left activists to pump far left propaganda to everywhere on earth. Like I just, you remember that, that like old RCA radio tower thing where it's like radio tower on earth and it's just broadcasting. Yeah.",

And, and, and, and she got a longer sentence than the guy who raped her in Germany. Just\n\nThe uk, Europe, Germany, England thing Seems so insane. It\n\nIt's totally insane. I actually didn't realize it was like such a huge number of people that got 12,000.\n\nYeah. Far above Russia, far above China, right. Far above anywhere on Earth. UK is number one.\n\nWell, you know, things like, I, I actually, you know, I talked to friends of mine in, in in England and I was like, Hey, aren't you worried about this? Like, you know, shouldn't you be protesting more? And I mean, the problem is that like the, you know, the, the, the legacy mainstream media doesn't cover the stuff, right? They, they're, they're like, oh, everything's fine, everything's fine. You know? Right.\n\nAnd most people aren't even aware of it until they come knocking on your door.\n\nYeah. Until s like, like, so I mean the, the, these, these like lovely sort of small towns in, in, in, you know, in England, Scotland, Ireland, you know, they're, they're, they've been like sort of living their lives quietly. They they're, they're, they're like hobbits frankly. So, so it's in fact JRR Tolkien based the Hobbit on people he knew in small town England because they, they were just like lovely people who like to, you know, smoke their pipe and, and have nice meals and everything's pleasant. The ho the hobbits in the Shire, the shire, he is, he is talking about, you know, places like Hartfordshire, like the Shires around in, in, in the greater London area, Oxfordshire type of thing. And they, they've, they've, but they're, the reason they've been able to enjoy the Shire is because hard men have protected them from the dangers of the world. And, but, but since they have no ex or very really almost no, no exposure to the, the, the dangers of the world, they don't realize that they're there until one day, you know, a thousand people show up in your village of 500 outta nowhere and rape and, and start raping the kids. This has now happened. God knows how many times in, in Britain.\n\nAnd the crazy thing is\n\nLiterally rape because it's right like this, some 10-year-old got raped in Ireland like last week. Yeah.\n\nThere's literal\n\nRape gangs. They snatched some kid. Yeah, yeah.\n\nAnd if you criticize it, you can get arrested. And that's where it gets insane. It's like, how are they not\n\nProtecting people? Criticize it. Like the, I think as the prime minister of island actually, you know, posted on X 'cause because after that some, I, I think some illegal migrants snatched a 10-year-old girl who was like gonna school or something and violently raped a 10-year-old girl. And there was a, you know, the people were very upset about this and they protested the prime minister of Ireland instead of saying, yeah, we, we really shouldn't be importing violent rapists into our country. He criticized the protestors instead and didn't mention that, that the reason they were protesting was because a, a 10-year-old girl from their small town got raped.\n\nSo there, here's the question. Why are they supporting this kind of mass immigration and what, like, is this, is there a plan involved in all this? Is just, is this incompetence? Is this ignoring the fact that they don't have a handle on it? So they're trying to silence dissent, like what is happening? Because if you wanted to destroy civilization, if you wanted to destroy western civilization's,\n\nWhich so seems to wanna do. And you know, there's just, so the, the, there's, there's a guy I think who I dunno if if he's been on your show, you know God's side. Yeah. Has he been on the show? Good\n\nFriend of mine. Yeah. Yeah, he is great. He's been on multiple times.\n\nOh great. That's all. He's awesome. Yeah. So, you know, he, the way he, he's he's got a good, good way to describe it, which is suicidal empathy. Yes. So is is that you prey upon people's empathy. You say like, well if like you feel sorry for, for, for something, for, for some group. And then like, well, and, and that, that, that empathy is to such a degree that it is suicidal to, to, to your country or culture. And, and, and that's, that, that's suicidal empathy. 'cause I don't think we should, we should have empathy. But, but, but we should have, we should. That empathy should, should extend to the victims. Not, not not just the criminals. We should have empathy for the people that they prey upon. But that suicidal empathy is also responsible for, for, for why somebody's, you know, arrested 47 times for, for violent offenses gets released and then goes and murders somebody in the US That, that, that's, you see, you see that same phenomenon, phenomenon playing out everywhere where the, the suicidal symphony is to such a degree that we're, we're actually allowing our women to get raped and our children to get killed.\n\nBut it just doesn't seem like that would be anything that any rational society would go along with. That's what makes me so confused. It's like you're importing massive numbers of people that come from some really dark places of the world.\n\nWell, there's no vetting is the issue. Right? It's like, it's like if like there, there's, if, if there's no vetting, like people are just coming through like, well, what's the stop? Someone who just com committed murder in some other country from coming to, to the United States or coming to to, to Britain and just continuing their career of, of rape and murder. Like you, unless you've done, if this some due diligence to say like, well who, who is this person? Watch their track record. If, if you, if you haven't confirmed that they have a track record of being, you know, honest and not being a homicidal maniac, then any homicidal maniac can just come across the border. Let's not to say everyone who comes across the border is a homicidal maniac, but if you're not have, if you don't have a vetting process to con to confirm that you're not letting in people who, who will do some serious violence, you will get people who do serious violence sometimes coming through.\n\nWell, especially if you don't punish them and if you don't deport them. Yes. And if you are just like, well, what, but what is the purpose of allowing all those people into the country? It can't be, I wouldn't imagine that anyone in their society supports this.\n\nWell, let me explain. So, so, so the, because you mentioned for example, how much say Hillary and, and Obama have changed their tune from prior speeches where they were hot, they were hardnosed about not letting in anyone who's a, a criminal into the country, you know, having sec, secure borders, all that stuff. So why did they change their tune? The reason is that they discovered that those people vote for them. That's why they want the open borders.\n\nBecause if you let people in, they know the Democrats let them in. They'll vote for Democrats. Yes. If you allow them to vote,\n\nWhich, which they're actively trying, do they, they turn a blind eye to illegal voting.\n\nWell, California literally doesn't allow you to show your license.\n\nCalifornia and New York have made it illegal to show your photo ID when voting. Thus effectively they've made it impossible to prove for fraud. Impossible. They, they've, they've essentially legalized fraudulent voting in California and New York and, and many other parts of the country.\n\nThere's no rational explanation that I've ever seen anyone give as to why that would be the policy. Unless you were trying to just allow people to vote illegally because there's no other reason. If you need a driver's license or you need an ID for everything else Yes. Including just recently to prove that you were vaccinated.\n\nThe, the same people who are demanding that you have that, that you have a vaccine passport and, and, and are are the same ones saying you need no ID to vote. Same people.\n\nRight. But like,\n\nSo it's obviously hypocritical and inconsistent. So you\n\nReally think it's just to, to get more voters.\n\nIf, if you want to understand behavior, you have to look at the incentives. So once you know, the Democratic party in the US and the left in, in, in, in Europe realized that if you have open borders and you provide a ton of g governed handouts, which creates a massive financial incentive for people from other countries to, to come to, to, to your country and you don't prosecute them for crime, they're gonna be beholden to you and they will vote for you. And that's why Obama and Hillary went from being against open borders to being in favor of open borders. That's the reason in order to import voters so they can win elections. And the problem is that that has a, a, a negative runaway effect. So if they get away with that, like it, it it is, it is a winning strategy. If they're allowed to get away with it, they will import as many the enough voters to get super majority voting. And then there is no turning back.\n\nWe talked about this before the election. Yes. And then you, you know, you literally pointed towards the camera, you face the camera and said that if you do not vote now, you might not have be able to do it again. Right. 'cause it, it'll be it'll be futile. It'll be overrun. Yes. They'll keep the borders open for another four years and then their objective will be achieved.\n\nCorrect. If, if, if, if Trump had lost, there would never have been another real election again tr because Trump is actually enforcing the border. Now you, you can, can you point to situations where there's been, you know, you know, immigration ha you know, enforcement has been overzealous. They, 'cause they're not gonna be perfect. There'll be cases where they've been overzealous there in, in expelling illegals. So, but if you say that the, the the standard must be perfection for expelling illegals, then you will not get any expulsion because perfection is impossible. So,\n\nAnd you've probably got millions of people that are here that are trying to be here under some asylum pretense, right? Yes. Like you could just come from a war torn\n\nPart of the world. Well, they changed. No, they, they, they changed the definition of asylum to be an economic, to be economic asylum, which\n\nIs everybody. Which\n\nIs everybody. Yeah. So it's lowest\n\nBar to prove\n\nIt's Yeah. Is asylum is supposed to mean that if you go back to your country, you'll get killed. Right. You know, that, that's what we mean by that was what it's supposed to mean. They change the definition of asylum to be, you'll have a decreased standard of living, which is obviously not real asylum. And, and it's, and and you can, you can test the absurdity of this by the fact that people who are asylum seekers go on vacation to the country that they're seeking asylum from. You know, that doesn't make any sense. Yeah.\n\nIt doesn't have to,\n\nYou know, when you, when You understand the incentives, then, then You understand the behavior. So once the left realized that that illegals will, will vote for them if they allow, if, if they have open borders and, and combine that with, with governed handouts\n\nYeah.\n\nTo create a massive incentive. They, they're basically using us and, and, and Europe, us and European taxpayer dollars to provide a financial incentive to bring in as many illegals as possible to vote them into a, into permanent power into and create a one party state. And and I, I invite anyone who's who's listening to this just do do any research. And the more you, the more you dig into it, the more it'll become obvious that what I'm saying is absolutely true.\n\nWell, they were busting people to swing states. It, it's, it's clear that they were trying to do something and then you had Chuck Schumer and Nancy Pelosi who are actively talking about the need to bring in people to make them citizens because we're in population collapse.\n\nYes. Yeah. No, that's, it's, it's that, it's that meme Yeah. Where so many times where they start off by saying it's it's not true. It's a right wing conspiracy theorist. Right. Then then it starts, then, then it's like, I think the ne the next step is well, it, it might be true.",

And then the final step is it's true. And here's why it's good. Yeah. And it's like, but wait a second. You start off saying it's untrue and it's a right wing conspiracy theorist. Now you're saying it, it only is it true, but it's a good thing and we must do more of it.\n\nWell this is the thing about Medicaid and social security. Yes. And people getting social security numbers, you know, that were illegal. It's, it's\n\nMassive\n\nFraud. It's massive fraud and it's real. And they denied it forever. And now we're finding out this is part of the reason why this is government shutdown that's going on right now.\n\nYes. The, the entire basis for the government shutdown is that, is that the Trump administration correctly does not want to send massive amounts of like hundreds of billions of dollars to fund illegal immigrants in the blue states or in all the states Really. And so the, and the Democrats want to keep the, the, the money spigot going to incent illegal immigrants to come into the US who will vote for them. That's the crux of the battle.\n\nSo they wanna stop this. So what's going on right now is they have been funding these people. They've been giving them EBT cards, they've been giving them Medicaid and they've been even housing\n\nThem. And more than that, just like, like, like they were how the, like, like they, they were taking hotels like four and five star hotels, like the Roosevelt Hotel being, the classic example was they were sending I think $60 million a year to the Roosevelt Hotel to which all it did was, was house legals. And it used to be an nice hotel. I mean it still is an nice hotel, but, and, and the, for all around the country this was happening and\n\nAll tax dollars.\n\nYes.\n\nYeah.\n\nAnd yeah, and the Trump administration cut funding for example too to the, to the, you know, Roosevelt Ho Hotel and these other hotels saying like, we, it, it's US Tax dollars should not be paid, be sent to have luxury hotels for illegal immigrants that American citizens can't even afford. Which obviously is the case that that's, that's insane. That's what was happening. They, they were also giving out like debit cards with $10,000. So it's not just about medical care. Yeah. The, the, the, the, the Democrats mention the medical care because they're, they're trying to prey on people's empathy as much as possible. And then they imagine, oh wow, somebody has a desperately needed medical procedure and shouldn't we maybe do, you know, take care of them in that regard? But, but they, what they do is they divert the Medicaid funds and turn it into a slush fund for the, for the states that goes well beyond emergency medical care.\n\nAnd\n\nNew York and California would be bankrupt without, without the massive fraudulent federal payments that go to those states to pay for illegals to, to, to create a massive financial incentive for, for illegals.\n\nHow would they be bankrupt? Because of that,\n\nThey wouldn't be able to balance the state budgets, and they can't issue currency like the Federal Reserve can.\n\nAnd so the, their ability to balance budget is dependent upon illegals getting funding.\n\nThe, the, the scan level here is, is so staggering. So there are, there are hundreds of billions of dollars in, of, of transfer payments from, from the federal government to the states. Those transfer payments, the, the states self-report, what those transfer payment numbers should be. So California and New York and Illinois lie like crazy and say, and, and say that this, these are all legitimate payments. Well, these days they, I think they've, they're even admitting that they, they, they literally want hundreds of billions of dollars for legals. But, but for a while there, they're trying to deny it. So you get these transfer payments for, for every, every government program you can possibly think of. And, and, and these are self-reported by the state. And they're, and, and at least historically, there was no enforcement of, of California, New York, Illinois, and, and, and other states when when they would lie, there was no actual enforcement to say like, Hey, you're, you're lying. These, these, these payments are fraudulent now under the Trump administration, that the Trump administration does not want to send hundreds of billions of dollars of fraud fraudulent payments to the states. But, and the reason you have this, the standoff is because if the hundreds of, hundreds of billions of dollars to, to create a financial incentive to like, to have this giant magnet to attract illegals from every part of earth to, to these states, if, if that is turned off, they, the, the, the illegals will leave because they're no longer being paid to come to the United States and stay here. Wow. And then, then, then they will lose a lot of voters. The, the, the Democratic party will lose a lot of voters\n\nAnd they would've a very difficult job if this is kicked out of reintroducing it into a new bill.\n\nYes.\n\nEspecially once things start normalizing.\n\nYes. So like in, in a nutshell, the Democratic Party wants to destroy democracy by importing voters. And the, you know, the Republican party disagrees with that.\n\nAnd the ruse is that if you don't accept what they're doing, then you're a threat to democracy.\n\nYes.\n\nAs they try to destroy democracy\n\nYes.\n\nBy importing voters. That is literally\n\nWhat\n\nThey're doing. And incentivizing people to only vote for them and overwhelming the system.\n\nYes. And, and by the way, it's a strategy that if allowed to work, would work and in fact has worked. California is super majority Democrat.\n\nYeah.\n\nAnd, and there's so much gerrymandering that, that, that occurs. It's, it's, it's crazy. So\n\nYeah. I'm sure you're paying attention to this Proposition 50 thing.\n\nNo,\n\nThat's the thing in California where they're trying to re redo districts. Oh, yeah,\n\nYeah, yeah. Because I mean, California's already gerrymandered like crazy. Yeah. They wanna gerrymandered even more. And, and I mean, there are, 'cause it\n\nKeeps moving further and further, right? Like if you look at the map of California, each voting cycle, more and more people are waking up and going, what the fuck? And we need to do something to fix this. The only option available other than the policies that you guys have always done Yeah. Is go right. And so a lot of people have been air, air quotes, red pilled. Yeah. And,\n\nAnd, and then here's another thing that is very important in fact, that that is actually not disputed by, by either side, which is that when, when we do the census in the United States, the census, the way the census works for apportionment of congressional seats and electoral electoral college votes for the President is by a number of persons in a state, not number of citizens. Right. It's number of PE people. So you could literally be a tourist and you will count.\n\nNow. Now, how do they do the census when they do that? Do they, is it, do they ask people, do they knock on doors? Do they have 'em fill out forms? Like what?\n\nYeah, I think they, they, they mail out census forms and knock on doors. But the, the way the law reads right now and, and is that all if, if you are a human with a pulse, then you count in the census for allocating congressional seats and presidential votes.\n\nRight?\n\nSo you, you, so\n\nElectoral college\n\nCongressional seats, everything, everything. It doesn't matter whether you're here legally, illegally, and if, if you're a human with a pulse, you count for congressional apportionment. So that means that the more people, the more illegals that California and New York can, can import when by the time the census happens in 2030, the more congressional seats they will have and the more electoral, the more presidential electoral college votes they will have. So they're trying to get as many illegals in as possible ahead of the census. And because all hu all human beings, even tourists count for the census. And, and then if you combine that with gerrymandering of, of districts in New York and California, as you point out with this proposition where they're trying to increase the amount of gerrymandering that occurs in California, the biggest state in the country. So, so you get so, so if the, if the, the census then would award more congressional seats to California because of a vast number of illegals and New York and Illinois. So they'd get more congressional seats, they'll get more presidential electoral college votes getting that would get them the house, a majority in the house. And, and, and would, they would get to decide who is president based, literally based on legals. This isn't, these are not disputed facts by either party. I want emphasize that. That's inkin. Yeah.\n\nThis is not a\n\nDispute. These are not disputed facts by either party. It's not a, these are just, this is just the, the way the law works. It, it's, it is a, you know, like, I don't think the law should work that way. I think it should. The, the apportionment should be proportionate to, to, to citizens.\n\nBut isn't that a problem with how the constitution is written? Yeah, yeah. Yeah. They can't really change that.\n\nI, I I'm not sure if it's constitutional or, but it, it, it, it is the way the law is written. I'm not sure if it's in the constitution or not in this way, but, but it is, that is the way the law is written. So\n\nIt is an incentive and, but it's an incentive that would be removed with something simple that makes sense to everybody. That only the people that should count are people that are official US citizens.\n\nYes. The way, the way it should work is that only US citizens should count on the census for purposes of, of determining voting power.\n\nBecause people that aren't legal can't vote.\n\nSupposedly. They're not supposed to be voting. But, but they do. But, but even, even if, even besides that, like I said, I I, I just can't emphasize this s enough 'cause this is a very important concept for people to understand, is that the law, the, the law as it stands, counts all humans with a pulse in, in, in, in a state for deciding how many house of representative votes and how many presidential electoral college votes as a state gets. So the incentive, therefore is to, for California, New York, Illinois, to maximize the number of illegals. So they get, so, they get, so that they take house seats away from red states, assign them to California and New York, Illinois, and so forth. Then, then you combine that with extreme gerrymandering in, in, you know, California, New York, Illinois and, and whatnot. So that, that basically, you, you can't even elect any Republicans. And then they get control of the presidency, control of the house. Then they keep doing that strategy and, and cement a super majority that is what they're trying to do.\n\nSo that would essentially turn the entire country into California. Yes. Well, you have differing opinions, but it doesn't matter because one party is always in control.\n\nYes. When\n\nYou first started digging into this, when you first started, before you even accepted this role of running Doge and being a part of all that, did you have any idea that it was this fucked up?\n\nI, I did. Yeah. I, I mean, I sort of\n\nWhen did you start knowing,\n\nI guess about like, well, about two years ago.\n\nIsn't that crazy? Yeah.\n\nLike relatively recently, you know? Yeah. So maybe I started, I started having, well, I, I started had like, basically had having a bad feeling about three years ago, which is why, which was, which is when, why, why? I felt it was like critical to acquire Twitter and have a maximally truth seeking platform. Not one that suppresses the truth. And like, it, it was more, it was more like I, I, I'm like, I'm not sure what's going on, but I have a, I have a bad feeling about what's going on. And then the more I dug into it, the, the more I was like, holy shit, we got a real problem here and America's gonna fall. So\n\nWithout anyone knowing it had fallen, that's, that would be the problem. It could have fallen and been unrepairable without anyone really being aware Yeah. Of what had happened. Especially if you didn't buy Twitter.\n\nYes. That's, that's, look, buying Twitter was a, a huge pain in the ass and made me a, a a a pin cushion of attacks. Like dab dap, dap, dap dap. Everybody\n\nLoved you before that.\n\nWell, some people, it's a love,\n\nA lot of people loved you, a lot of lefties loved you.\n\nI I was a hero of the left. It's fair to say\n\nIt was a thing if you drove a Tesla, it showed that you were environmentally conscious. Yes. And you were on the right side.\n\nYeah. Yeah. I mean, I'm still the same human. I didn't like have a brain transplant between, you know, since in like three years ago, you know. Well,\n\nThat's my favorite pumper sticker that people put on Teslas. Now, I bought this before Elon went crazy. I took a picture of one the other day. Oh,\n\nYou found his? I\n\nWas behind somebody. Oh yeah. I've seen, I've seen three or four of 'em. People that have these bumper stickers on their car that says, I bought this before Elon went crazy because when people were\n\nVandalizing\n\nTeslas\n\nYeah. The most audience,\n\nThere\n\nWas organized campaign to literally burn down Teslas. And, and we had, one of our dealerships got shot up with a gun. Like they fired bullets into the, in the Tesla dealership. They're burning down cars. It was crazy. So, but the bumper sticker should read, there should be an, an addendum to the bumper sticker. It's like, I bought this car before Elon turned crazy, actually. Now I realize he's not crazy. And I've seen the light\n\nThat'll take some time. That'll take some time. People don't want to admit that they've been tricked.\n\nYeah. I mean, they don't like that, that old saying where it's like, it's really easy to fool somebody, but it's almost impossible to convince someone that they were fooled.\n\nYeah. It's much easier to fool them than to convince 'em they've been fooled. People clinging to their ideas. Yes. They, especially if they've like publicly stated these things, they've, they get very embarrassed of being foolish.\n\nYeah. People most time they double down and, and\n\nThey find echo chambers.\n\nYeah. Yeah. But, but there's, you, you know, the thing is that like I, you know, I've seen more and more people who were convinced of the sort of woke ideology. See the light? Yeah. So not everyone, but it's more and more are seeing the light. And, and it tends to happen like when, when something happens that really, you know, directly affects you. Right. You know, like there was a friend of mine who was living in, in the San Francisco Bay area, and that tried to trans his, his, his daughter, like to the point where the, the, the school like sent sent the police to his house to take his daughter away from him.

She, she went, she came, went back to normal meaning like the, it it, it wasn't real.\n\nRight. Well, people are being much more open to that now.

Permanent castration of, of kids is like, I, I think I we should look at, at anyone who permanently castrates a kid as like right up there with Joseph Maner. Yeah. I mean they're, they're mutilating children.\n\nYeah. Yeah. And it's thought of as being kind and the thing Yeah. Would you rather have a live daughter or a dead son?\n\nThat's that's the, that's the line they use.\n\nYeah. Which is not supported by any data.\n\nNo, it's all bullshit. In fact, the, the probability of suicide increases. Right. Because this is important maybe for the audience to know the probability of suicide increases if you trans a kid not decreases by some accounts it triples. So that, that is an evil lie.\n\nAnd it's a lie that is supposedly compassionate. Imagine you've twisted reality to the point where confusing a child that's not even legally allowed to get a fucking tattoo. Yeah. Right.

Yes. Yes. They'll castrate you. You no longer have testicles. You\n\nHave Yes. That's not coming\n\nBack. Have no penis. You have a hole where your penis used to be. Yes.

Which it should be viewed as like, you know, like, like evil Nazi doctor stuff, basically.\n\nWell, that's why it's,\n\nIt was so like real Nazi, not the bullshit fake Nazi stuff.\n\nCrazy that even pushing back against something that seems like fundamentally logically very easy to argue, the old Twitter would ban you forever.\n\nYes.\n\nThat's how crazy a social contagion can get when it completely defies logic victimizes children. Yeah. Does something that makes no sense, does not supported by data all connected to this ideology that trans is good. We gotta save trans kids. Protect trans kids.\n\nYeah. And what I want to emphasize is that the, the save trans kids thing is a lie. If if if you, if you, if you castrate kids and trans them, the probability of suicide increases, it does not decrease. It substantially increases the, the, the, the studies have done that. I've seen that the risk of suicide triples if you trans kids. So you're not saving them, you're killing them. Moreover, during the sex change operation, there are many deaths that occur during the sex change operation.\n\nJesus Christ. It's just crazy that this is a real issue.\n\nYeah. It it's a nightmare fever dream. And, and people are finally waking up from it.\n\nNow, when you started getting into the Doge stuff and started finding how much money is being shuffled around and moved around to NGOs and how much money is involved and just totally untraceable funds, like this is again, something like two years plus ago. You weren't aware of it all?\n\nNo, I was aware of it. I just didn't realize how, how the, how big it was. It was just, just, just how much waste and forward there is in the government is truly vast. In fact, the government didn't even know, nor did they care.\n\nThat's crazy. Yeah. And I mean,\n\nJust like some of the very basic stuff that Doge did will have lasting effects. And some of these things like they're so elementary, you can't believe it. So the, the Doge team got the, you know, the, the, the mo most of the main payments computers to require the, the congressional appropriation code. So when a payment is made, you have to actually enter the congressional appropriation code that used to be optional and, and often would be just left blank. So the money would just go out. But it wasn't even tied to a, a congressional appropriation. Then they also, doge team also made the comment field for the payment mandatory. So you have to say something we're, we're not saying that what, what is said, like you can say anything. You, you, you could, your cat could run across the keyboard. You could go query A SDF, but you have to say something above nothing. Because what we found was that there were tens of billions, maybe hundreds of billions of dollars. There were zombie payments. So there, like somebody had approved a payment, something the government approved a payment and some recurring payment and they retired or died or changed jobs and no one turned the money off. So the money would just keep going out. And, and it's a pretty rare\n\nAnd go where\n\nTo, to a company or an individual. And it's a pretty rare company or individual who will complain that they're getting money that they should not get. And, and a bunch of the money was just going to the, were transfer payments to the states. So\n\nThese are automatic payments there.\n\nYeah. Just automatic payments.\n\nNo accounting for them at all. Like\n\nImagine like, like there's an automatic debit of your credit card and you don't, you never look at the statement. Right. So it it is just money going out. I call 'em zombie payments that there might have been, there might have been legitimate at one point, but the person who approved that recurring payment changed jobs, died, retired or whatever. And no one ever turned the money off. And my my guess is that's probably at least a hundred billion dollars a year, maybe 200\n\nAnd going where?\n\nTo, to, I mean there, there are millions of these payments. So, so it's, I mean,\n\nMillions.\n\nYes. Yes.\n\nMillions of payments that are going to, who knows where.\n\nYes. So in a bunch of cases, there are fraud rings that operate, professional fraud rings that operate to exploit the system. They figure out some security hole in the system and they just do professional fraud. And, you know, that's where we found, for example, people who were, you know, 300 years old in the Social security administration database.\n\nNow I thought that this was a mistake of not registering their deaths. That people were born like a long time ago and it had defaulted to like a certain number. And so that after time those people were still in the system. It was just an error of the, the way the accounting was done.\n\nYeah. So that's not true. So there's, or or at least one of two things must be true. The, there's a, there's a typo or, or some mistake in the computer or it's fraudulent. But we don't have any 300 year old vampires living in America. Allegedly. Allegedly. And, or, or, and we don't have people in some cases who, who are receiving payments who are born in the future. Born in the future. Born in the future. Really? Yes. There were, there, there the people receiving payments whose birth date was like in 2100 and something. Okay. So there's\n\nThere like\n\nNext century is\n\nThere a task course?\n\nSo we know, we know that one of two things must be true. That, that there, that either there's a mistake in the computer or it's fraud, but if you have someone's birth date that's either in the future or where they're older than the oldest living American. 'cause the oldest living American is 114 years old. So if they're more than 114 years old, there was either a mistake and someone should, should call them and say, I I think we have your birthday wrong. Because it says you were born in 17, you know, eighty, eighty six. And you know, that was before, you know, you know, before there was really in America, you know, it was like, it was like, you know, it's kind of early, you know, we're still fighting England type of thing. You know, it's like this person either needs to be the Guinness Book or World Records or, or they're not alive. But still\n\nAt the end of the day, money is going towards that account that's connected to this person that is either non-existent or\n\nDead. So like yeah, so there was like, I think something like on a 20 million people in the Social Security administration database that could not possibly be alive if their birthdate is like, based on their birthdate, they could not possibly be alive.\n\nAnd then to be clear, 20 million people that were receiving funds,\n\nA bunch of, most of them were not receiving funds. Some of them were receiving funds. Most were not receiving funds. But, so lemme tell you how the scam works. It's, it's a bank shot. So the Social Security administration database is used as the source of truth by all the other databases that the government uses. So even if they stop the payments on the Social Security administration database like unemployment insurance, small business administration, student loans, all check the Social security administration database to say, is this, is this a a legitimate alive person? And and if the social security database will say, yes, this person is still alive, even though they're 200 years old, but forget to mention that they're 200 years old, it just says, it just returns when, when the computer is queried, it says, yes, this person is live. And so then they're able to exploit the entire rest of the government ecosystem. So fake. Then you get fake student loans, then you get fake unemployment insurance, then you get like fake medical payments. And\n\nThis doesn't have to be tied to an individual where, where there's an address we can check on this person.\n\nNo, if you did do, if you just did any check at all, you would stop this. So, so, so that's that, that, that's so, so,\n\nAnd how much money do you think is made\n\nAny check, like anything at all the, the then that would start would stop the fraud? Like any effort at all. Yeah.\n\nSo there's multiple layers. Yeah. The social security number verifies that this is a real person. Right. And then the other system check up on\n\nCan exploit every other government payment and, and every other government payment system for everything. For, like I said, small, small business administration, student loans, Medicaid, Medicare, every other government payment of which there are many, there are, there are actually hundreds of government payment systems can all be exploited so long as social security database says this person is alive. That's the nature of the scam. It's a bank shot. So then the, then the rebuttal from the Dems is like, oh, well the vast majority of the people who are marked as live in the Social Security Administration weren't receiving Social Security administration payments. That is true. What they forgot to mention is they're getting fraudulent payments from every other government program. And that's why the, the, the dams were so opposed to turning off to, to declaring someone dead who was dead because it would stop the entire other, all the other fraud from happening.\n\nAnd so, but all this, is it trackable, like all this other fraud? It's tryable if they wanted to, they could chase it all down. Yeah.\n\nIt's not even hard.\n\nAnd yet they're opposing cha cha chasing it all down.\n\nThey're opposing chasing it all down because it would, it turns off the money magnet for the illegals.\n\nWow.\n\nBecause it's very logical to, to like, like I'm saying, the most common sense things possible. If someone's got a birthday in social security, that is an impossible birthday, meaning they are older than the oldest living American or born in the future, then you should call them and say, excuse me, we seem to have your birthday wrong because it says that you're 200 years old. That's all you need to do. And, and then\n\nYou would remove them from the social security database and make that number no longer available for all those other government payments. Exactly.\n\nWow.\n\nAnd how much money are we talking?\n\nIt's a hundred hundreds of billions of dollars.\n\nAnd this is all traceable. Like you could hunt all this down.\n\nWhat is like, you don't need to be Sherlock Holmes here is what I'm saying.\n\nWell, this\n\nIs, we, we don't need to call Sherlock Holmes for this one. Is this part of this? We just need to call the person is this and, and, and say, excuse me. We either ha we, we seem to have the, like we, we, we must have your birthday wrong because it says you're 200 years old or we're born in the future.",

      "transcript_chunk": "birthday in social security, that is an impossible birthday, meaning they are older than the oldest living American or born in the future, then you should call them and say, excuse me, we seem to have your birthday wrong because it says that you're 200 years old. That's all you need to do. And, and then\n\nYou would remove them from the social security database and make that number no longer available for all those other government payments. Exactly.\n\nWow.\n\nAnd how much money are we talking?\n\nIt's a hundred hundreds of billions of dollars.\n\nAnd this is all traceable. Like you could hunt all this down.\n\nWhat is like, you don't need to be Sherlock Holmes here is what I'm saying.\n\nWell, this\n\nIs, we, we don't need to call Sherlock Holmes for this one. Is this part of this? We just need to call the person is this and, and, and say, excuse me. We either ha we, we seem to have the, like we, we, we must have your birthday wrong because it says you're 200 years old or we're born in the future. So could you tell us what your birthday is? That's what we need to do. It says that simple.\n\nBut the, all these other government payments that are available that are connected to this social security number, it seems like if you just chased that all down Yeah. You would find the widespread fraud you would find where it's going.\n\nYes. The the but the, the root of the problem is the social security Right. Administration database. Because the social security number in the United States is used as a defacto national ID number. You know, that's why like the bank always asks for your social, right. So like the, you know, any financial institution will ask for your social security number.\n\nThis is, it sounds so insane that this isn't chased down. I mean, like I agree that, I mean, I mean that in and of itself is, that's such mishandling.\n\nYes.\n\nNo, it's my, it's mind blowing. So Yeah. It's crazy.\n\nWell, you were very reluctant last time you were here to talk about the extent of some of the fraud. 'cause you're like, they could kill me because this is kind of, oh,\n\nWhat, yeah, what I was saying is that the, like if you create, if like I, I like, like to be pragmatic and realistic, you actually can't manage to zero fraud. You, you can manage to low fraud number, but not to zero fraud. If you manage to zero fraud, you, you, you're gonna push so many people over the edge who are receiving fraudulent payments that the number of inbound homicidal maniacs will be really hard to overcome. So I I'm, I'm, I'm actually taking I think, quite a reasonable position, which is that we should simply reduce the amount of fraud, which I think is not an extremist position and we should aspire to, you know, have less fraud over time. Not that we should be altered the draconian and eliminate every last scrap of fraud, which I guess would be nice to have. But, but like, we don't even need to go that extreme. I'm, I'm saying we should just stop the latent large scale super obvious fraud. I think that's a reasonable position. It's\n\nA very reasonable position. Yeah. And so what was the most shocking pushback that you got when you started implementing Doge, when you started investigating into where money was going?\n\nWell, I guess it, this was, I should have anticipated this, but while most of the fraudulent government payments to, especially to the NGOs go to the Democrats, most of it like, I don't know for argument's sake, let's say 80%, not maybe 90%, 10 to 20% of it does go to Republicans. And so when turn off funding to a fraudulent NGO would get complaints from whatever the 10% of Republicans who were receiving the money and, and they would, you know, they would very loudly complain because they're the, the, the honest answer is the Republicans are, are partly they're receiving some of the fraud too. They're getting a vig\n\nJesus.\n\nYeah. It's, it's, I wanna be clear, it's, it's not like the Republican party is some no ultrapure paragon of virtue here. No. Okay. Well\n\nYou see that with the Congressional insider training. It's across the board.\n\nYeah.\n\nIt's left and right.\n\nI mean, the whole uni party criticism has some validity to it. You know, there's so, and it's, it's like if you turn off fraudulent payments, it's not like, like I said, it's not like 100% of those payments were going to, to Democrats a, a small percentage were go also going to Republicans. Those republicans complain very loudly. And you know, and, and that's, that's, so they, there there was a lot of pushback on the Republican side for when we started cutting some of these, these funds. And I tried telling 'em like, well, you know, 90% of the money is going to your opponents, but they still, if they, even if they're getting 10% of money, they want their\n\nPeace.\n\nYeah. They want their peace.\n\nAnd they've been getting that piece for a long time. Yes. Did you\n\nThink this is why like, you know, politics is like\n\nIt's dirty business?\n\nYeah, I mean that's like saying if like, you know, if, if you, if you like sausages and respect the Lord, do not watch either of them being, being made.\n\nYeah,\n\nYeah,\n\nYeah. Wow.\n\nWell that's not even true because I've made sausage before.\n\nYeah, yeah. It's\n\nActually, yeah, it's like, it's not that big a deal. Yeah. Fat and spices and casing run it through the machine. Not that big a deal.\n\nYeah. But yeah, I mean I I I think the stuff I'm saying here is not like, like if you, if you stand back and think about it for a second, like, oh yeah, that, that makes sense. You know? Yeah. The, it, it's, it's not like it, it's not like one political party's gonna be, you know, pure devil or pure angel. There, there's, you know, I think there's, there's, there's, there's much more corruption on the Democrat side, but it's not, there's not, there's still some corruption on the Republican side. How\n\nDid it happen that the majority of the corruption wound up being on the Democrat side?\n\nWell, because the, the, the, the transfer payments, especially to illegals are very much on the Democrat side. That,\n\nSo that's the root of it all is the illegal situation.\n\nYes. I mean there's, or\n\nA focal\n\nPoint. Yes. It, it's also like, it's, it's, it's, it would also be accurate to say that while o obviously not everyone who is a Democrat is a criminal, almost everyone who is a criminal is a Democrat because, because the Democrats are the soft on crime party. So if you're a criminal, who are you gonna vote for?\n\nRight?\n\nRight. The soft on crime party,\n\nDid you think you were going to be able to get more done than you were?\n\nWe did get a lot done. Right. And Doge is still, still still happening by the way, the, this, the, the doge is still underway. There are still, there are still, there's still waste and fraud being, being cut by by the Doge team. So it hasn't stopped the, it's less\n\nPublicized.\n\nIt's less publicized. And they don't have like a clear person to attack anymore.\n\nWell, it seems like once you stepped\n\nAway, they're, they're, they're basically, they, they, they applied immense pressure to me to just, to stop it. So then I'm like, the best thing for me is to just, you know, cut outta this. And in any case, as a special governor employee, I could only be there for like 120 days anyway. Something like that. So whatever the law says, so I, I could, I I I was necessarily could only be there for four months as a special government employee. So, but yeah, I mean, I mean, you turn off the money spigot to, to fraudsters, they get very upset to say the least. And, but my, like, my death threat level went ballistic, you know, it was like a, like a rocket going orbit. Yeah. So, but now that, now, now that I'm not in DC that, that, that I, that I guess they don't really have a person to attack anymore. Well,\n\nThe rhetoric about you has calmed down Si significantly.\n\nYeah.\n\nIt was disturbing. It was disturbing to watch. It was like, this is crazy. Yeah. And to watch these politicians engage in it and all these people just like framing you, it was this monster. I was like, this is so weird. Like, this is what happens when you uncover fraud. Yes. The whole machine turns on you. Yeah. And if it wasn't for a person like you who owns a platform and has an enormous amount of money, like it could have destroyed you.\n\nYeah.\n\nAnd that was the goal.\n\nThe goal was to destroy me. Absolutely. Because\n\nYou were getting in the way Yeah. Of this amazing graft. The,\n\nThe, the this gigantic fraud machine. Yeah. Like I said, I think we, we've, we've, I think those teams Aren done a lot of good work, you know, in in, in terms of fraud and waste prevented, my guess is it's, you know, probably on the order of two or 300 billion a year. So it's pretty good.\n\nWhat do you think could have been done if you just had like full reign and total cooperation? How much do you think you could have saved?\n\nI mean, what level of p of power are we assuming here? God-like, oh yeah, I could probably cut the federal budget in half and get more done.\n\nThat is so crazy. It is so crazy that it, it's\n\nThat, yeah. Get more done and federal vision half widespread,\n\nIt's that widespread.\n\nWell, I mean, a whole bunch of government departments simply shouldn't exist in my opinion. They, they, they, you know,\n\nLike examples,\n\nWell, the Department of Ed, department of Education, which was created recently, like under Jimmy Carter, the, our education results have gone downhill ever since it was created. So if you, if you create a department and the result of creating that department is a massive decline in educational results and it's department of education, you're better off not having it because we're literally, we, we were did better before there was one than after\n\nWhen you let the states run it. Yes. Yeah. Because\n\nAt least the states can compete with one another. So, but the problem is like here, like cutting department, educational, our kids need education. Yeah, they do. But, but this is a new department that didn't even exist, you know, until late, the late seventies. And ever since that department was created, the results, educational results have declined. And so why would you ha have an institution continue that has made education worse? It doesn't make sense. They\n\nKilled it though, right? No,\n\nThere still is, unfortunately.\n\nBut they were trying to kill it.\n\nIt has been substantially reduced.\n\nOkay.\n\nWhat\n\nOther organizations, what other departments? Well,\n\nI mean, I'm a small government guy, so, you know, when, when the, you know, when the country was created, we just, we, we just had the department of state, department of War, you know, and, and sort of the, sort of the Department of Justice. We had an attorney general and treasury department. I don't know why you need more than that.\n\nI, so what are the departments specifically do you think are just completely ineffective?\n\nWell, I mean, here it's like a question, it's a sort of philosophical question of how much government do you think there should be?\n\nRight.\n\nIn, in my opinion, there should be the least amount of government. I've\n\nHeard the most bizarre argument against this is that you're cutting jobs and you're gonna leave people jobless. And I'm like, but their jobs are useless.\n\nDetrimental. Yeah. Paying people, detrimental people to do nothing doesn't make sense. Right. Like there's a, like a, a a great, I this is a story about like Milton Friedman who's awesome, what, like, generally whatever Milton Friedman said is, you know, people should, should do that thing. I'm not sure if it's apocryphal or not, but like, like someone complained to him, like, or he, he, he observed I think people that were like digging ditches with, you know, with, with shovels. And, and he said, well, like allegedly Freeman said, well I think I think you should use, you know, excavating equipment instead of shovels and you could get it done with far fewer people. And then, and then someone said, but then we're gonna lose a lot of jobs. Well, in that then freedom was says, well, in that case, why don't you have 'em use teaspoons?\n\nJust,\n\nJust dig ditches with teaspoons. Think of all the jobs you'll create. I, I mean It's bullshit basically you just want people to work on, on things that are, that are productive. You want people to work on, on building things, on building, you know, providing products and services that people find valuable. Like, you know, making food, being, you know, being a farmer or a plumber or electrician or just anyone who's a builder or providing useful services. And that's what you want people to be doing. Not fake government jobs that, that, that don't add any value or may subtract value. Well there's also like, you know, to illustrate the absurdity of also how is the eco, how is the economy measured? Like the, the way economists measure the economy is, is is nonsensical because they'll measure any job, no matter, even if that job is a dumb job that has no point and is even counterproductive. So like, so like, like the, the joke is like, there's two economists going on a hike in the woods and they come across a a pile of she and one economist says the other, I'll pay you a hundred dollars to eat, eat that shit.\n\nAn\n\nEconomist eats the shit, gets the a hundred dollars, they, they keep walking. Then the other econom, then they come across another pile of shit. And, and the, the other economist says, now I'll pay you a hundred dollars to eat the pile of shit. So pays the, so pays the other economist a hundred dollars a pile of shit. Then they, then, then, then the way said, they said, well wait a second, we both just ate a pile of shit and we are no, and, and, and, and we're, we're, no, we, we, we, we, we, we don't have any more extra money. Like, like we both just gave the a hundred dollars back to me and we both ate a pile of shit. This doesn't make any sense. And they said, no, no, but think of the economy. 'cause that's $200 of, of in the economy that, that, that, that basically then measure eating, eating shit would count as a as as a, as a job.\n\nThis\n\nIs, this is, this is to illustrate the absurdity of of, of e of economics.\n\nOne of the things you said when you\n\nEating\n\nKnocked away, when you down as a\n\nJob, one of the things you said when you stepped away is that you're kind of done and that it's unfixable that\n\nWell\n\nOr under its current form, the way people are approaching it,\n\nYou, you, you can, you can make it directionally better, but ultimately you can't fully fix the system. So I I I like, like, like, like it, it it is, it is, it would be accurate to say that even like, unless you could go like super draconian like, you know, Genghis Kahn level on, on, on cutting waste at waste and fraud, which you can't really do in a democratic country, an aspirationally democratic country, then there's no way to solve the, the, the debt crisis. So we've got, we've got national debt that's just insane where the debt payments, the interest payments and the debt exceed our entire military budget. I mean that's one, that was one of the wake up calls for me. I was like, wait a second. The interest on a national debt is bigger than the entire, the entire military budget and growing this is crazy. So, so, so even if you implement all these savings, you're only delaying the day of reckoning for when America becomes, goes bankrupt. So unless you go full gangs con, which you can't really do. So, So I came to the conclusion that the only way that the only way to get us out of the debt crisis and to prevent America from going bankrupt is AI and robotics.

      "transcript_chunk": "on a national debt is bigger than the entire, the entire military budget and growing this is crazy. So, so, so even if you implement all these savings, you're only delaying the day of reckoning for when America becomes, goes bankrupt. So unless you go full gangs con, which you can't really do. So, So I came to the conclusion that the only way that the only way to get us out of the debt crisis and to prevent America from going bankrupt is AI and robotics. So like we need to grow the economy at, at a, at a, at a rate that allows us to, to pay off our debt. And I I I, I guess people just generally don't appreciate the degree to which, you know, this, the, the, the government overspending is, is a problem. But even like the social security website, this is under the Biden administration on the website, it would say like we, based on, on current demographic trends and you know, and, and, and how much money social security is bringing in versus how many social security recipients there are. Because we have an aging population, relatively speaking, the average age, age is increasing. Social security will not be able to make, maintain its full payments I think in by 2032. So they'll, social security will have to stop or start reducing the, the, the amount of money that that's been paid people in, in about seven years.\n\nAnd so the only way to fix that robotics, manufacturing raise GDP,\n\nYou've gotta basically massively increase the economic output, which is, and the only way to do that is AI and AI and robotics. So, so basically we're going bankrupt without AI and robotics, with, even with a bunch of savings. The savings, the savings, like reducing waste and forward can give us a longer runway, but it cannot ultimately hafi national debt.\n\nSo what do you think the solution is to the jobs that are gonna be lost because of AI and robotics? The jobs due to automation, the jobs due to no longer do we need human beings to do these jobs? 'cause AI's doing them, do you think it's going to be some sort of a universal basic income thing? Do you think there's gonna be some other kind of solution that has to be implemented? Because a lot of people are gonna be outta work, right?\n\nI think there will be actually a high demand for jobs, but not necessarily the same jobs. So I mean this, this is actually, this process has been happening throughout modern history. I mean they used to be like, like doing calculations ma manually with, with, with like a pencil and paper. It used to be a job. So they used to have like buildings full of people called computers where the, the, the banks would like all you do all day is, is, is you, you'd do calculations. 'cause they didn't have computers. They didn't, they didn't have digital, didn't have digital computers that, that people do. Yeah, well it was just people would just like adding, subtract stuff on a piece of paper and, and, and that, that would be how banks would do, you know, financial processing.\n\nAnd you'd have to literally go over their equations to make sure the books are balanced.\n\nYeah. And most times it's just simple math. Like, you know, the, like in a world before computers, how did you calculate, how did you do transactions? You had to do 'em by hand. So then when computers were introduced the job of doing, you know, bank calculations no longer existed. So people had to go do something else. And that's what's gonna happen. That what, that's what is happening at an accelerated rate due to AI and, and and then robotics.\n\nThat's the issue though, right? The accelerated rate. 'cause it's gonna be, it's\n\nThe accelerator, it's, it's, it's just happening, like I said, like AI is the supersonic tsunami. So that's what I call it supersonic tsunami. So it's\n\nLike what other jobs will be available that aren't available now because of ai?\n\nWell, AI will is, is really still digital. Ultimately AI can improve the productivity of, of humans who, who build things with their hands or do things with their hands like plum, you know, literally welding, electrical work, plumbing, anything that's, that's physically moving atoms. Like say like cooking food or you know, farming or, or like, like anything that's, that's physical. Those jobs will exist for a much longer time. But anything that is digital, which is like just someone at a computer doing something, AI is gonna take over those jobs like lightning\n\nCoding, anything along those lines. Yeah, yeah.\n\nIt's gonna take over those jobs like lightning, just like it just like digital computers took over the job of people doing manual calculations, but but much faster.\n\nSo what happens to all those people? Like what kind of numbers are we talking about? You gonna lose most drivers, right? Commercial drivers, you're gonna have automated vehicles, AI controlled systems. Just like there's certain ports in China and I think it's Singapore where everything's completely automated.\n\nYeah, mostly. Yeah. Yeah,\n\nYeah. So you're gonna lose a lot of those jobs, longshoreman jobs, trucking, commercial drivers.\n\nYeah. I mean we actually do have a shortage of, of truck drivers, but there's, there's actually, well that's\n\nWhy California's hired so many illegals to do it. Have you seen those numbers?\n\nYeah, I mean the problem is like when you, when people don't know how to drive a semi-truck, which is actually a hard thing to do, then they, they crash and kill people. Yeah. A friend of mine's wife was killed by an, an illegal driving a truck and she was just out biking and there was an an an illegal who didn't know how to drive the truck or, or something. I mean, and he, he ran and ran her over. So I mean, like the thing is like for something like you, you, you can't, you can't let people drive, you know, sort of an 80,000 pound semi if, if they don't know how to do it. But in California they're just letting people do it\n\nBecause they need people to do it\n\nWell, they also need, they want the boats and that kind of thing. But, but, but yeah, like cars are, cars are gonna be autonomous, but there's, there's just so many desk desk jobs where, where really people, what people are doing is they're processing email or they're answering the phone and, and just anything that is that, that isn't moving atoms. Like anything that is not physically like doing physical work, that will obviously be the first thing. Those jobs will be and are being eliminated by, by AI at a very rapid pace. And ultimately I working will be optional because you'll have robots plus ai and we'll have in a benign scenario, universal high income, not just universal basic income. Universal high income, meaning anyone can have any products or services that they want.\n\nSo you,\n\nBut, but there will be a lot of trauma and disruption along the way.\n\nSo you anticipate a basic income from that, that the economy will boost to such an extent that a high income would be available to almost everybody. So we'd essentially eliminate poverty\n\nIn the benign scenario. Yes. So like\n\nThe ways, there's multiple scenarios,\n\nThere are multiple scenarios, there's a lot of ways this movie can end. Like the reason I'm so concerned about AI safety is that like one of the possibilities is the terminator scenario. It's not, it's not 0%. So that's why it's like, I'm like really banging the drum on AI needs to be maximally truth seeking, like don't make, I don't force AI to believe a lie like that. The, for example, the founding fathers were actually a group of diverse women, or that misgendering is worth the nuclear war. 'cause you if, if that's the case and then you get the robots and the AI becomes omnipotent, it can enforce that outcome. And then, then like, unless you're a diverse woman, you're, you're out of the picture. So we're, we're toast.\n\nSo\n\nThat's, or you might wake up as a diverse woman one day. AI has force, you adjusted the picture and and we're now diverse woman.\n\nEveryone's a diverse woman. So that would be Yeah, that's the, the worst possible situation. So, so what would be the steps that we would have to take in order to implement the benign solution where it's universal high income, like best case scenario, this is the path forward to universal high income for essentially every single citizen that the, the economy gets boosted by AI and robotics to such an extent that no one ever has to work again. And what about meaning for those people? Which is, which gets really weird.\n\nYeah. I don't know how to answer the question about meaning.\n\nThat's an individual problem, right? But it's gonna be an individual problem for millions of people.\n\nYeah, Well, I I mean I, I I, I guess I've like fought, fought against saying like, you know, I, you know, I've been, I've been voice saying like, Hey, we need to slow down ai, we need to slow down all these things and, and we need to, you know, not, not have a crazy AI race. I've been saying that for a long time, for 20, 20 plus years. But, but then I, you know, I came to realize that really there's two choices here. Either be a spectator or a, or a participant. And if I'm a, if I'm a spectator, I can't really influence the direction of ai, but if I'm a participant, I can try to influence the direction of AI and have a maximally true seeking AI with, with good values that loves humanity. And that's what we're trying to create with grok at XAI. And you know, the research is, I think bearing this out, like I said, the when they, when they compared, like how do AI value the weight of a human life? Grok was the only one, the only one at Theis that weighted human life equally and, and didn't and didn't say like a white guy's worth one 20th of a, of a, of a black woman's life. Literally. That's what the, they, they ca that the calculation they came up with. But again, so I'm like, this is, I'm like, this is very alarming. We should, we gotta watch this stuff.\n\nSo this is one of the things that has to happen in order to reach this benign solution.\n\nYeah, we we, we I I just keep\n\nBest movie ending. Yeah.\n\nYou you want to a curious truth seeking ai and I think a curious truth seeking AI will wanna foster humanity because we are much more interesting than a bunch of rocks. Like you said. Like, like I, I love Mars, you know, but, but Mars is kind of boring. Like it is just a bunch of red rocks. It it, there's some cool stuff. It's got a tall mountain, it's got, you know, it's got the biggest reve, the biggest ravine and the tallest mountain, but there's no, there's no, there's no animals or plants or, and, and there's no people and you know, so humanity is just much more interesting if you're a curious truth seeking AI than not humanity. It's just much more interesting. I mean like as, as humans we could go for example and, and and eliminate all chimps. If we said, if we put our minds to it, we could say we could go out and we could annihilate all chimps and all gorillas. But, but we don't, there has been encroachment on their environment, but we, we actually try to preserve the, the, the chimp and gorilla habitats And, and, and I think in a good scenario, AI would do the same with, with humans. It would actually foster hu human civilization and care about human happiness. So this is, this is the thing to, to try to achieve, I think.\n\nBut what is the, what does the landscape look like if you have gr competing with open AI competing with all these different, like how does it work? Like what, what, what if you haveis that have been captured by ideologies that are side by side competing with grok. Like how do we, so this is one of the reasons why you felt like it's important to not just be a, a, an observer, but participate and then have grok be more successful and more potent than these other applications? Yes.\n\nAs long as there's at least one AI that is maximally truth seeking, curious and, you know, and for example, ways old, you know, human lives equally does not favor wine, race or gender. Then, then, then that, that, that and, and, and people are able to look at, look at, you know, at XI and compare that and say, wait a second, why are all these other ais being basically sexist and racist? And then, then that, that causes some embarrassment for the, the other ais. And then they, they they, they, they fake. They, you know, they, they improve, they tend to improve just in the, in the same way that acquiring Twitter and allowing the truth to be told and, and not suppressing the truth forced the other social media companies to be more truthful by, in, in the same way having grok be a maximally truth seeking curious AI is will force the other AI companies to be also be more truth seeking and fair.\n\nAnd the funniest thing is, even though like the socialists and the Marxists are in opposition to a lot of your ideas, but if this gets implemented and you really can achieve universal high income. That's the greatest socialist solution of all time. Like literally no one will have to work.\n\nCorrect. Like, like I said. So, so there is a benign scenario here, which I think probably people will be happy with if, if as long as we, we achieve it, which is sustainable abundance, which is if, if, if everyone can have every, like, like, like if, if you ask people, like, what's the future that you want? Right? And I think a future where we haven't destroyed nature. Like you can still, we have the national parks, we have the, the Amazon rainforest is still, is still there. We haven't paved, we haven't paved the paved the rainforest, like the national beauty is still there. But, but people have, nonetheless, everyone has abundance. Everyone has excellent medical care. Everyone has whatever goods and services they want.\n\nAnd we would just essentially\n\nJust because that's, it kind of sounds like heaven\n\nBasically. Yeah. It sounds like it is like the ideal socialist utopia and this idea that the only thing you should be doing with your time is working in order to pay your bills and feed yourself. Sounds kind of archaic considering the kind of technology that's at play. Yeah. Like a world where that's not your concern at all anymore. Everybody has money for food. Everybody has abundance, everybody has electronics in their home. Everybody essentially has a high income. Now you can kind of do whatever you want and your day can now be exploring your interests, doing things that you actually enjoy doing. Your purpose just has to shift. So instead of, you know, I'm a hard worker and this is what I do and that's how I, right. That's how I define myself. Not now you can fucking golf all day. You know, you can, whatever it is that you enjoy doing can now be your main pursuit. Yeah. Well that sounds crazy good.\n\nYeah. That's, that's the benign the best. That's, that's, that's the benign scenario that we should be meaningful.\n\nThe best ending to the movie is actually pretty good.\n\nYes. Like I think there's, there is still this question of meaning of like making sure people don't lose meaning, you know, like, so hopefully they can find meaning in ways that are not, that that's not derived from their work and\n\nPurpose. Purpose for things that you, you know, find things that you do that you enjoy. But there's a lot of people that are independently wealthy that spend most of their time doing something they enjoy. Right. And that could be the majority of people,\n\nPretty much everyone.\n\nBut we'd have to rewire how people approach life, which seems to be like acceptable because you're not asking them to be enslaved. You're exactly a asking them the opposite. Like, no longer be burdened by financial worries, now go do what you like.\n\nYes.\n\nGo fucking test pizza. Do whatever you want.\n\nYes. Pretty much. So that's, that's, that's the, that's the, that's probably the best case outcome.\n\nThat sounds like the best case outcome period for the future. If you're looking at like how much people have struggled just to feed themselves all throughout history, food, shelter, safety, if all that stuff can be fair, like how much would you solve a lot of the crime if there was a universal high income?",

If you're looking at like how much people have struggled just to feed themselves all throughout history, food, shelter, safety, if all that stuff can be fair, like how much would you solve a lot of the crime if there was a universal high income? Just think of that. Like how much of crime is financially motivated, you know, the greater percentage of people that are committing crimes live in poor disenfranchised neighborhoods. So if there's no such thing anymore, if you really can achieve universal high income Yeah. That this is, it sounds like a utopian\n\nYes. I think some people may commit crime because they like committing crime just Oh sure. Some amount, some amount of that is they just destroy\n\nWhile people out there.\n\nYeah. Yeah.\n\nAnd obviously they've become 40 years old living a life like that. Now all of a sudden universal high income is not gonna completely stop their instincts.\n\nYeah. I mean, I guess if you want to have like, like say read a science fiction book or some books that, that are probably inaccurate or, or the, the least inaccurate version of the future, I'd say I'd, I'd recommend the Ian Banks books called the, the, the culture books. It's not actually a series. It's a, it's like a s sci-fi books about the future. They're generally called the Culture books, Ian Banks culture books. It's worth reading those. When\n\nDid he write these?\n\nHe started writing them in the seventies, and I think he, the last one, I think he was, I think it was written just like around, I dunno, maybe 2010 or something. I'm not sure exactly.\n\nI\n\nYeah, yeah.\n\nScottish author Ian Banks. Yeah. From 87 to 2012. Yeah. Interesting.\n\nBut he, but like, he wrote the, the, the, like his first book Consider Fleas. I think he started writing that in the seventies.\n\nI, and,\n\nBut these books are incredible by the way. Oh, incredible books.\n\n4.6 stars on Amazon. Interesting.\n\nSo,\n\nSo this gives me hope.\n\nYeah, yeah, yeah. This\n\nIs the first time I've ever thought about it this way.\n\nYeah. Well, I mean, if, like, I'll often ask people what is the future that you want? And they have to think about it for a second. 'cause you know, they were usually tied up in whatever their daily struggles are. But, but you say, what is the future that you want? And, and generally sustainable abundance, or at least folks say, what about a future where there's sustainable abundance? Like, oh yeah, that's a pretty good future. So, you know, if, if, and that, that future is attainable with AI and robotics. But, but you know, it's, it's like I said, there's not every path is a good path. There's this, it's, but I think if we, if we push it in the direction of maximally truth seeking and curious, then I think AI will want to take to, to take care of humanity and foster foster humanity because we're interesting. And if it hasn't been programmed to think that like all straight white males should die, which Gemini was basically programmed to do at at least first, you know, they seemed to have fixed it, hopefully fixed it. But\n\nDon't you think culturally like, oh, we're getting away from that mindset and that people realize,\n\nYeah, I think\n\nWe're getting away from how preposterous that all is.\n\nWe we're getting away from it. So we are getting at, at least it knows, the AI mostly knows to hide things. But like, like I said, there is that I, I think I still have that as, or I had that as my like pin pinned post on X, which was like, Hey, wait a second guys, we still have every ai except Roc is saying that basically straight white males should die and this is a problem and we should fix it. You know, but simply me saying that is like tends to generally result in, you know, them like, Ooh, that is kind of bad. Maybe we should just, we should not have all straight white males die. I think they have say also all, all, all straight Asian males should also die as well. They like, they don't like, like generally, generally the AI and the, and the media, you know, which, which ba back in the day, the AI and the, the, the media wa was, you know, racist against black people and sexist against women back in the day. Now, now it is racist against white people and Asians and ra and sexist against men. So, and over they're just like being racist and sexist. I think they just want to change the target. So, but, but really they just shouldn't be racist and sexist at all, you know, obviously.\n\nYeah. Ideally that would be nice.\n\nThat would be nice.\n\nAnd it's kind of crazy that we were kind of moving in that general direction till around 2012 and then everything ramped up online and, and everybody was accused of being a Nazi and everybody was transphobic and racist and sexist and homophobic and everything got exaggerated to the point where it was this wild witch hunt where everyone was a colombo looking for racism.\n\nYeah, yeah, yeah. Totally. Well, well, but, but, but they, they were openly anti-white and often openly anti-Asian.\n\nAnd then this new sentiment that you cannot be racist against white people. 'cause racism is power and influence and Okay, no it's not.\n\nYeah. Racism is, is is racism in the absolute. So, you know, and, and there just needs to be consistency. So if it's okay to have, let's say black or Asian or Indian or pride, it should be okay to have white pride too. Yeah. So that's just a con, that's just a consistency question. So, you know, if it, if it's okay to be proud of one religion, it should be okay to be proud of I I guess all religions provided there that, that they're, they're not like\n\nOppressive.\n\nYeah. Or, or, or don't, like, as long as part of that religion is not like exterminating people who are not in that religion type of thing.\n\nRight.\n\nSo it's really just like a consistency bias or, or just like ensuring consistency to eliminate bias. So if it is possible to be racist a against one race, it's possible to racist against any race. So of\n\nCourse, logically yes. Yeah. And arguing against that is, that's when you know you're captured.\n\nIt's, it's, it's a, it's a logical inconsistency Yeah. That makes AI go insane.\n\nAnd people,\n\nAnd people go insane. Yes. What more, but like the, the like, like you can't simultaneously say that the, the the systemic racist oppression, but also that racists don't exist. That that that race ra race is a social construct. Like which is it, you know, you also can say that, you know, anyone who steps foot in America is is automatically an American except for the, the people that originally came here.\n\nExactly. Exactly. Except for the colonizers.\n\nYeah. Except for the evil colonizers who came here. Right. So which one is it like, right. If, if you step as if as soon as you step foot in a place you are, that you are just as American as everyone else, then that would've applied. If you apply that consistently, then the original white settlers were also just as American as everyone else.\n\nYeah.\n\nLogically, logically.\n\nOne more thing that I have to talk to you about before you leave is the rescuing of the people from the space station, which we talked about. You were planning it the last time you were here. The fact the the lack of coverage that that got in mainstream media was one of the most shocking things that they\n\nSeen. Yeah. They totally memory hold that thing\n\nWild. Yes.\n\nBecause if it, it\n\nWasn't\n\nYou, it's like, it's like it didn't exist.\n\nThose people would be dead. They'd be stuck up there.\n\nWell, they'd, they'd probably still be alive, but they'd, they'd, they'd, they'd be having bone density issues because of prolonged exposure to zero gravity. Well, they\n\nWere already up there for like eight months. Right. Yeah. Which is an insanely long time. It takes forever to recover just from that.\n\nYeah. They're only supposed to be at the Space station for three to six months maximum. So\n\nOne of the things that you told me that was so crazy was that you could have gotten them sooner, but\n\nYeah. But for political reasons they didn't. They, they did not want SpaceX or me to be associated with returning the astronauts before the election.\n\nThat is so wild that that's a fact. Oh yeah. First of all, that even\n\nWe, we absolutely could have done it. So,\n\nBut even though you did do it and you did it after the election, it received almost no media coverage anyway.\n\nYes. Because nothing good con the, the, the media, which is essentially a far of pro the legacy mainstream media is a far left propaganda machine. And so anything, any story that is positive about someone who is not a part of the sort of far left tribe will not get any coverage. So I I I could save a busload of orphans and, and it, it wouldn't get a single news story.\n\nIt's, it really is nuts. It it was nuts to watch because even though it was discussed on podcasts and it was discussed on X and it was discussed on social media, it still, it was a blip in the news cycle. It was very quick. Yeah. It was in and out and because it was a successful launch and you did rescue those people, nobody got hurt. And there was nothing really to, there was no blood to talk about. Right. Just fucking in and out,\n\nGone. Yeah. Yeah, absolutely. Well, and, and as, as you saw firsthand with the Starship launch, like Starship is, you know, by, you know, at least by some, some would consider it to be like the most amazing, you know, engineering project that's happening on earth right now, outside of like, you know, maybe AI or AI and robotics. But, but certainly in terms of a spectacle to see it is the most spectacular thing that is happening on earth right now is, is the Starship launch program, which anyone can go and see if they just go to South Texas and just they can just run a hotel room, low cost in South Padre Island or in Brownsville, and you can see the launch and, and you can drive Right, right past the factory. 'cause it's on a public highway, but it gets no coverage or, or what coverage does get was like a rocket blew up\n\nCoverage, so, right. Yeah. Oh, he's a fuck with the rocket blew up.\n\nYeah. The, the, like, the, the, the, the Sasha program is vastly, vastly more capable than the entire Apollo Moon, moon program. Vastly more capable. Th th this is a spaceship that is designed to make life multi-planetary, to carry millions of people across the heavens to another planet. The, the Apollo program could, could only send astronauts to the moon for a few hours at a time. Like they could send two, the entire Apollo program could only send astronauts to visit the moon very briefly, and then for a few hours, and then depart the Starship program could create an entire Luna base with a million people. You understand the mag the magnitudes are different, very different magnitudes here.\n\nSo what, what was the political\n\nResistance? But there's basically no, no coverage of it.\n\nYeah. But what I wanted to ask you is like, what, so what were the conversations leading up to the rescue? Like when you were like, I can get them out way quicker?\n\nYeah, well, I mean, you know, I raised this a few times, but it was the, I was told instructions came from the White House that, you know, that the, that there should be no attempt to rescue before the election.\n\nThat should be illegal. That, that, that really should be a, a horrendous miscarriage of justice for those poor people that were stuck on that.\n\nYeah. It it is, it is crazy. Have\n\nYou ever talked to those folks afterwards? Did you have conversations with them?\n\nYeah, I mean they, they're, they're not gonna say anything political to be, you know, they're not like, they're never gonna curse. Did\n\nThey at least say Thank you?\n\nYeah, yeah, yeah. Well that's nice. Yeah, yeah. Absolutely. So,\n\nBut the instructions came down from the White House. You cannot rescue them because politically this is a, a bad hand of cards.\n\nI mean, they didn't say because politically it's a bad hand of cards, but they, they just said they weren't, they were not interested in any rescue operation before the election. Yeah. So\n\nWhat did that feel like?\n\nI wasn't surprised,\n\nBut it's crazy.\n\nYeah.\n\nBecause Biden could have authorized it and they could have said the, the Biden administration is helping bring those people back, throw you a little funding, give you some money to do it. The Biden administrator, they funded these people being returned.\n\nYeah. The Biden administration was not exactly my best friend. Thats what I heard. Especially after I, you know, you know, help Trump get elected, get get elected. Which I mean, some people still think, you know, Trump is like the, the devil, basically. And I mean, I think, I think Trump actually, he is, he is not perfect. But, but he's not evil. Trump is not evil. I mean, I spent a lot of time with, with him and he's, I mean, he's a product of his time, but he is not, he's not evil. No,\n\nNo. I don't think he's evil either. But if you look at the media coverage,\n\nThe media, the media's Theresa Nike's super evil. Yeah.\n\nIt's pretty shocking. If you look at the amount of negative coverage, like one of the things that I looked at the other day was mainstream media coverage of you trump a bunch of different Oh yeah. Public figures and then mom,\n\n96% negative or something crazy. Yeah.\n\nAnd then Momani, which is like 95% positive,\n\nRight? I mean, Momani is, is is a charismatic swindler. I I've, I mean, you gotta hand it to him. Like he, he did, he can't light up a stage, but he is just been a swindler his entire life. And, you know, and, and I, I think he, he what? He's, I mean he's likely to win li he's likely to be mayor of New York, New York City.\n\nVery likely.\n\nYeah. Very likely. I think\n\nWhat poll market has it at? What, what is the 94%? 94%?\n\nYeah, that sounds pretty likely. That's crazy. Like, I'm not sure who the 6% are, you know, so, so, so yeah. So that's, well\n\nIt's also like who's on the other side? The fucking guardian angel guy with the Beret and Andrew Cuomo, who doesn't even have a party like the, the Democrats don't even want 'em. So you have those two options and then you have the young kids who are like finally socialism.\n\nYeah. They, they dunno what they're talking about, obviously. So, you know, like you just look at this, say how many boats come from Cuba to Florida and how many, but, and how many boats because you know, there's like a constant, I was thinking like, how many boats are accumulating on the shores of Florida coming from, from Cuba. Right. There's a, there's a whole bunch of free boats that you could, if you want to go take 'em back to Cuba, it's pretty close. Yeah. But for some reason people don't do that. Why? Why, why, why are the boats only coming in this direction? Well, who\n\nIs, who are the most rabid capitalists in America? The fucking Cubans.\n\nAbsolutely.\n\nYeah. They're like, we've seen how this story goes.\n\nWe do not want Exactly. Yeah.\n\nFuck off. They don't Cubans in Miami, they don't want to hear any bullshit. They don't wanna hear any socialism bullshit. They're like, no, no, no. We know what this actually is. This isn't just some fucking dream.\n\nYeah. It's extreme Go oppression. Yeah.\n\nThat's what it\n\nAlways means. It's is a nightmare.",

And, and like the, the like and obvious way you can tell which, which ideology is, is the bad one, is who has to, which ideology is building a wall to keep people in and prevent them from escaping. Right. Like, so East Berlin built the, built the wall, not West Berlin. Right. They built the wall because people were trying to escape from communism to West Berlin, but there wasn't anyone going from West Berlin to East Berlin. Right. That's why the communist had to build a wall to keep people from escaping. They're gonna\n\nHave to build a wall around New York City.\n\nYeah. That so, so you, this guy is a\n\nCharismatic\n\nThat an ideology is problematic if that ideology has to bull day wool to keep people in with machine guns. Yes. And shoot you if you try to leave also,\n\nThere's no examples of it being successful ever. Yes. We're really working out for people. No, there's examples of a bunch of lies. Like North Korea give this land to the state, we'll be in control of food. No one goes hungry. No. Now no one can grow food. But the government, and we'll tell you exactly what you eat and you eat very little. Right? Yeah. What, when you say mom, Donny's a swindler. I know he has a bunch of fake accents that he used to use. Yeah. And, you know, but what else has he done that makes him a swindler?\n\nWell, I, I guess if you say what I mean, if you, if you say, if you say to any audience, whatever that audience wants to hear, instead of what, instead of having a consistent message, I would say that that is a swindling thing to do and Yeah. Yeah. But but he is, he is charismatic. Yeah.\n\nGood looking guy. Smart, charismatic. Yeah. Great. On a microphone.\n\nYeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Exactly.\n\nAnd, and what the young people wanna see, you know, like this ethnic guy who's young and vibrant and has all these socialist ideas aligns with them and you know, there are a bunch of broke dorks just outta college. Like, yay, let's vote for this. And there's a lot of 'em. And they're, they're activated, they're motivated,\n\nI guess. We'll, we'll, we'll see, we'll see what happens here. What\n\nDo you think happens if he wins? 'cause like 1% of New York City is responsible for 50% of their tax base, which is kind of nuts. 50% of the tax revenue comes from 1% of the population. And those are the people that you're scaring off. You know, you lose one half of 1%.\n\nI dunno, I mean hopefully the, the stuff he's, he said, you know, about government takeovers of, of like that all the stores should be the government basically. Well I\n\nDon't think he said that. I think he said gov. They wanna do government supermarkets, some state run or city run supermarkets.\n\nYeah, well it just, the, the, the government is the DMV at scale. So you have to say like, do you want the DMV running your supermarket?\n\nRight.\n\nWas your last experience that the DMV amazing. And if it wasn't, you probably don't want the government doing things.\n\nImagine if they were responsible for getting you blueberries.\n\nYeah. It's not gonna be good. I mean the, the, the thing about, you know, communism is, is it was, it was all bread lines and bad shoes. You know, do, do you want ugly shoes and bread lines? 'cause that's what communism gets you.\n\nIt's gonna be interesting to see what happens and whether or not they snap out of it and overcorrect and go to some Rudy Giuliani type character next. 'cause it's been a long time since there was any sort of Republican leader there.\n\nI mean, we live, we live in the, in the most interesting of times because we, we, we face the, you know, simultaneously face civilizational decline and incredible prosperity. And these, these timelines are interwoven. So if, if Ma Dani's policies are put into place, especially at scale, it, it would be a catastrophic decline in living standards. Not just for the rich, but for everyone. As, as has been the case with, with every, every, for every every socialist experiment or every and Yeah. So, but, but then as you pointed out, the, the irony is that like the ultimate capitalist thing of AI and robotics enabling prosperity for all and, and abundance of goods and services, actually the capitalist implementation of AI and robotics, assuming it goes down the, the good path is, is actually what results in the communist utopia. 'cause f fate is an irony maximizer,\n\nRight. And, and an actual socialism of maximum abundance of high income people.\n\nUniversal high income. Yeah. Like the, the, the, the problem with communism is, is this universal low income. It's, it's not that everyone gets elevated, it's that everyone gets oppressed except for a very small minority of, of politicians who live lives of luxury. That's what's happening every time it's been done. Yeah. So, but then the, the actual communist utopia, if everyone gets anything they want will be, will be if, if will be achieved. If it is achieved, it will be achieved via cap capitalism. 'cause fate is an irony. Maximizer,\n\nI feel like we should probably end it on that. Is there anything else?\n\nThe most ironic outcome is the most likely, especially if entertaining.\n\nWell, everything has been entertaining. Yeah. As long as the bad things aren't happening to you, it's quite fascinating. And it's never a boring moment.\n\nYes. I, I, so there's, I do have a theory of why, like if, if if simulation theory is true, then it is actually very likely that the most interesting outcome is the, is the most likely because only the simulations that are interesting will continue. The simulators will stop any simulations that are boring. 'cause they're, that they're not interesting.\n\nBut here's the question about the simulation theory. Is the simulation run by anyone? Or is\n\nYeah, it would be run by someone.\n\nIt would be run by,\n\nOr some, some, some\n\nForce.\n\nThe pro the program, like in, in this reality that we live in, we, we run simulations all the time. Like, so when we try to figure out if the rocket's gonna make it, we run thousands, sometimes millions of simulations just to figure out which, which path is the good path for the rocket And, and where can it go wrong? Where can it fail? But we, when we do these, I say at this point, millions of simulations of, of what can happen with the rocket. We ignore the ones that are where everything goes. Right? Because we, we, we just care about the, we have, we have to address the situations where it goes wrong. So, so, so basically, and, and, and, and, and for, for AI simulations as well, like, like all these things we, we keep the simulations going that are the most interesting to us. So if simulation theories accurate, if, if it is true, who knows, then the, the, the, the, the simulators will, will only con they will continue to run the simulations that are most interesting. The therefore from a Darwinian perspective, the only surviving simulations will be the interest, the most interesting ones. And in order to avoid getting turned off, the only rule is you must keep it interesting or you will if, or you'll, because the boring simulations will be terminated.\n\nAre you still completely convinced that this is a simulation?\n\nI didn't say I was completely convinced.\n\nWell, you said it's like the odds of it not being, or in the billions, I guess that's not completely, 'cause you're saying there's a chance.\n\nWhat are the odds that we're in base reality? Well, given that, given that, that we're able to create increasingly sophisticated simulations. So if you think of say, video games and how video games have gone from very simple video games like pong with, you know, two rectangles in a square to video games today being photorealistic with millions of people playing simultaneously. And all of that has occurred in our lifetime. So if that trend continues, video games will be indistinguishable from reality. The fidelity of the game will be such that you, you don't know if that what you're seeing is a real video or a fake video. And like AI generated videos at this point, you like, you can sometimes tell it's an AI generated video, but often you cannot tell and sun, you will not really just not be able to tell. So if, if that's happening in our direct observation then and, and we're we'll create millions if not billions of photorealistic simulations of reality, then what are the odds that we're in base reality versus someone else's simulation?\n\nWell, isn't it just possible that the simulation is inevitable, but that we are in base reality building towards a simulation?\n\nWe're we're making simulations. So we're making simulations. We, we we're make like you can just think of like photo realistic video games as, as being simulations and especially as you apply Yeah. AI in these video games, like the characters in the video games will be incredibly interesting to talk to. They won't just have a limited dialogue tree where if you go to like the, the crossbow merchant or like, and you, you try to talk about any subject except buying a crossbow, they just wanna talk about selling you a crossbow. But with with with AI based non-player characters, you can, you'll be able to have an elaborate conversation with no dialogue tree. Well\n\nThat might be the solution for meaning for people. Video games, just lock games, just walk in video and you could be a fucking vampire and whatever you live in avatar land, you could do it, you could do whatever you want. I mean, you don't have to think about money or food\n\nReady player one. Yeah.\n\nLiterally. Yeah. But with higher living standards,\n\nYeah.\n\nYou don't have to be in a little trailer. I,\n\nI mean, I, I think there people do want to have some amount of struggle or something they wanna push against, but, but it, it could be, you know, playing a, a sports or playing a game or something like that.\n\nIt could be easily playing a game. Yeah, yeah. And especially playing a game where you're now no longer worried about like physical attributes like athletics, like bad joints and hips and stuff like that. Now it's completely digital, but yet you do have meaning in pursuing this thing that you're doing all day. Whatever the fuck that means, it's gonna be weird.\n\nIt's gonna be interesting. It's gonna\n\nBe very interesting.\n\nThe most, the most interesting and, and usually ironic outcome is the most likely.\n\nAlright.\n\nThat's a good predictor of the future.\n\nThank you. Thanks for being here. Really appreciate. Yeah. Good to see you. Appreciate your time. You, I know you're a busy man, so this means a lot. You come here to do this.",

How the Devil is.\n\nI think it's the first time anyone's answered splendid when I ask him How you doing? So tell me about your book, man. Lemme see the cover of it. First of all,\n\nDeath by\n\nAstonishment. Death by Astonishment, which is the famous Terrence McKenna quote, right? Yes.\n\nHe was\n\nOff. The thing you have to Fear is Death by Astonishment. Exactly.\n\nYeah.\n\nYou know, the first time I did DMT, I literally heard his words Do not give into astonishment punishment. I literally heard those words. It's almost like whatever's over there. Yeah. Wanted me to hear that. Mm. So I could like sink in or whatever. 'cause I had already heard it before, you know, so they wanted to say it to me as well. It was very weird.\n\nYeah. It's sage advice, I think, because\n\nOh, it's the only way. No way. Because if you freak out, well, it's like, that's a good thing. It's good advice in most of life. Mm. Like, don't give in to the freak out. Yeah, yeah. Confronting the Mystery of the world's strangest drug. How did you get involved in this\n\nDMT? Yes.\n\nOh,\n\nSo you have to go back to my teenage years. Really? So, I mean, I first heard about DMT through Terrence McKenna, a friend again,\n\nLike most of us.\n\nYeah. Like most of us. But this was like, this was during like the dawn of the internet,\n\nRight. Long before you were a scientist. Long\n\nBefore I was a scientist. Right. So, a friend gave me this magazine and had this interview with this bearded, cheeky looking bearded fellow on the back called Terrence McKenna. And he spoke about this thing called DMT, which of course I didn't know what that was, but you know, the stories that he was telling that you were gonna meet these insectoid aliens and trans dimensional machine owls, jabbering in an indecipherable tongue and singing impossible objects into existence. I mean, it sounded ridiculous, but I was kind of, I was hooked. I thought, this is it. This is, this is the most fucking incredible thing I've ever read in my life. And say I was, I was like 15, 16 years old. And there, there was one computer in the school that was hooked up to the, the worldwide web. So all of like,\n\nWhat year was this?\n\n96.\n\nOh, early.\n\nI gave you my age away here, but\n\nEarly days of\n\nThe early days internet. Yeah. Yeah. So I spent all my time just, you know, going on to Alta Vista. Remember Alta Vista? I do.\n\nYeah. I didn't, I didn't remember it until you brought it up,\n\nRemember? Yeah. I was just kind of trying to find out as much as I could about this, and that was what triggered my decision to study chemistry and pharmacology. My kind of academic journey was, was triggered by, I want to know, you know, it's such a cool thing, the idea that you can, you can put a molecule in your brain and it, it doesn't just change how you feel, but it completely changes the entire structure of your reality. Your entire world is, is, is obliterated and replaced with one that is completely alien. That's a relationship whatsoever to that normal awaken world. That's incredible. And I kind of wanted to try at least to understand how that actually works.\n\nWell, the weirdest part about that molecules that your brain makes it. And so then you have to go, why? And what's the purpose of that? And what are we really, you know, what is, what is consciousness and what is, what is normal consciousness? What's the purpose of it? And why does this chemical exist? What does this molecule exist that's produced by the brain that changes everything and seems to transport you to a place that's more real than this physical reality that we find ourselves in right now.\n\nExactly. And that is kind of the great mystery. And I don't, I think most people who, even, even people who've kind of learned about DMT, even scientists, I mean, I, I speak to scientists. I, I engage with scientists, neuroscientists often, and they will say, oh, this is just hallucination. This is just your brain kind of making it up. And I don't think most scientists realize how confounding and how difficult to explain the DMT state is. I think it is one of, one of life's true mysteries. It is not simple to explain the DMT state.\n\nWell, I think it's almost irresponsible to try to explain it without experiencing it. It's not gonna kill you. Yeah. It's not gonna kill you. It lasts 15 minutes. Stop being a pussy. Right. Just do it and then tell me It's just hallucination. That's it. Yeah. Just do, do a big one. Three giant hits. Come back. Tell me, this is normal. Yeah. Tell me, this is just a freak out. 'cause it sure doesn't seem like it, does it?\n\nNo, and I mean, that was what I mean, I mean, I, I first learned about DMT as I said, when I was 15 or 16, but my first experience was probab well close to a decade later. And I thought before I took it, I thought I kind of knew what to expect. I mean, I'd listened to all the Terence McCann lectures I could find. I, I'd read all the books. I read all the trip reports, and I thought, okay, I'm kind of ready for this. I kind of know what's gonna happen. And I wasn't ready. And I was shocked. I was horrified in a sense. I was appalled. I mean, this was like, this is impossible. This was an impossible experience. I was confronted with an what seemed to me to be the, the undeniable hand of some kind of intelligence, and not just any kind of intelligence, but a supremely advanced, ancient and yet highly technological intelligence. And that was undeniable to me in those first few moments. Within sort of 30 seconds of that drug hitting my, my, my brain, I knew that this is, this is something else. And I was at first horrified. I was shocked. I just thought this, what is this? And then when I finally kind of came back, I was, I was, I remember lying on my bed, on my back, like shaking to my very bones. And all I could say was, oh my fucking God. Because I was completely confounded. You know? I mean, and by then I was a chemical pharmacologist. I was assigned it. I should, I should,\n\nYeah.\n\nI should know what's going on here. But I had no idea what was going on. And I thought, this is, this is it. This is what I need to get to grips with.\n\nIt also gives you a very, like an, an unusual understanding of the mechanisms that you interface with the world. Like, like ego and logic and reasoning and rational thinking. It gives you like this understanding that those are kind of just these weird tools that you use to get by. And you're left without them in there. It just, they, they evaporate and dissolve. And then when you come back, you're like, what am I doing? Yeah. The way I talk. Like, what, what is my, what's my purpose of interacting with people? Like what, how much of the way I talk to people. It's this weird social dance, weird ego, performative, sort of like the way I structure sentences, the way I communicate. It all seemed so clunky. When, when you come back and you just go, wow, we are a mess. Like collectively as a species, we're so without some sort of awakening or some, some kind of experience, some sort of a psychedelic profound breakthrough experience. Like you're so hampered by your physical existence and this sort of ancient tribal programming that we have that we're running through this maze of life with. And you come back and go, God, this is so weird.\n\nYeah. I think what DMT does is, is show you that everything, everything you thought you knew about how reality is structured and what's, what's real and what's not real, what is fantasy, what's possible, and what's not possible. Yeah. All of that is, is completely kind of extubated in an instant. And you realize, actually we don't, we don't have a fucking clue about the way things really are. I think DMT just demonstrates that, whether You understand it, whether we can, we can really understand what's going on in the brain and why, and how this experience is even possible. It just shows you how little we really understand about the, the nature of this\n\nEpisode is brought to you by the farmer's dog. I think we can all agree that eating highly processed food for every meal isn't optimal. So why is processed food the status quo for dog food? Because that's what kibble is, an ultra processed food, but a healthy alternative exists. The farmer's dog, they make fresh food for dogs. And what does it look like? Real meat and vegetables that are gently cooked to retain vital nutrients and help avoid any of the bad stuff that comes with ultra processing. And it's not just random ingredients thrown together. Their food is formulated by on staff board certified vet nutritionists. These people are experts on dog nutrition and they're all in on fresh food. The farmer's dog also does something unique. They portion out the food to your dog's nutritional needs. This ensures that you don't over feed them.

Yeah, I mean, I work mainly kind of, I guess you could say theoretically, in that I do more quantitative and qualitative analysis of the DMT state and try to understand, try to use the tools of neuroscience to try to understand how DMT elicits its its effects. So we can kind of get into, if you want Sure. If you wanna go really deep. Yeah, sure. I can give you a kind of a, a neuroscience lesson. Yeah. Please. Can talk about, so, so, you know, if you wanna understand DMT, we kind of have to start with the, the basic observation. You know, before you take DMT, you are experiencing a world, right? Whenever you're awake and conscious, you're experiencing a world, the normal waking world, this is the world that's kind of familiar to us. When you take DMT, that world is transformed. It disappears, it's obliterated, and it's replaced with one that is altogether stranger, shall we say. And so, so what I want to do is kind of understand, first of all how that happens, what's actually going on in the brain to cause that transition and why that happens. And you can't do that unless you have a, a decent understanding of the normal waking world. So what is the normal waking world? It's a model. It's an interface generated by your brain. So you have this world building machinery on the outerlay of your brain called the cortex. And this is generating your world all the time. All the features of the world that you're experiencing are represented within the cortex. And that applies whether you are just normal waking life. It applies in dreaming, it even applies in the psychedelic state. The world that you experience is, is always constructed as a model by the brain. And so what that means is that psychedelics, what they're doing is they're man, they're perturbing the brain. They're manipulating the brain and altering that model. Now, for example, with, let's say psilocybin from magic mushrooms, psilocybin binds to this receptor in the brain called the five HD two A receptor, which you're probably familiar with, the cy serotonin receptor. And so this is a, it's, it's called an excitatory receptor. It stimulates these neurons, which your cortex is constructed from, makes them more excitable, makes them more likely to fire and share information between two other neurons. You get this kind of loosening up of the, the world model that your brain is constructing. So the walls start to breathe, objects seem to kind of change their identity. Everything becomes more fluid and dynamic. And if you put someone into an MRI machine, for example, you can actually see that in the normal waking state. You can see the neural activity. It, it's, it's dynamic, but it's, it's kind of organized and well orchestrated. You give someone psilocybin, let's say, or LSD, and you start to see the activity becoming sort of more random and fluid. So you get this, this state of slightly increased disorder as if the, the, the, the kind of the tuning dial between order and disorder in the brain has been slightly nudged towards disorder. But then with DMT, something remarkable happens in the, the early stages of the experience. You get this kind of quite chaotic state suggesting that the rain is entering this more disordered state, but then it kind of collapses into this brand new order. So you go from the order of the normal waking world to this disordered state, and then you collapse into this completely different type of order. So the brain is effectively constructing an entirely different model of reality. It's no longer the normal waking world model, which acts as kind of an interface with the environment, but it's constructing a, a completely different world model.\n\nWhen you say constructing, why do you use that term? What, why do you use the brain is constructing\n\nBecause you are, well, okay, so, so if you think about, you know, how does the brain interact with the, how do we interact with the environment using our senses, right? So light information comes through the eyes, the retina, and it stimulates the, the very back of the brain. You have an area. Oh,\n\nOh, you brought slides.\n\nI brought slides. There we\n\nGo.\n\nYeah, maybe the next one, Jamie, is a bit easier to see. There we go. So at the right, the back of the brain here, you have an area called V one, which is the primary visual cortex. That's your interface with the world. Sensory information comes and strikes, it activates patterns of neural activity in V one. But it's very, very messy. It's like lines and patches of color and, you know, lines moving in certain directions. It's a mess, right? It's very noisy, it's very messy. It's incredibly dynamic. It doesn't make any sense. And so what your brain does is it has another level above V one that kind of has a bird's eye view and is looking for patterns within this neural activity in this lowest level. So it's looking, saying, oh, those lines kind of could be a triangle, or this could be a circle. It's trying to find patterns to try generate order from this messy level in V one. Can I\n\nAsk you this? How do we know it does that?\n\nThat's a good question. Well, there are a number of things. So the earliest evidence came from a, one of the earliest forms of evidence came from a guy called Wilder Penfield. Are you familiar with No. So Wilder Penfield, he was interested in treating epilepsy, and he invented something called the Montreal procedure where he would remove a part of the brain that was the focus of epileptiform activity. The idea being that it would kind of cure someone's epilepsy. But before he could do that, of course he needed to make sure that he wasn't removing, you know, important parts for someone's function. So what he would do is he would cut the top of their skull off when they're still awake. Yeah. And kind of expose their brain. And then he would zap different parts of their brain and say, you know, what's happening?",

We have to, like, it's the aliens probably look at us and go, oh my God, you guys are still doing that. Yeah.\n\nNowadays things have moved on a bit, right? I'm\n\nSure. But I mean, this is not that long ago, right? How long ago\n\nIs this? 1950s. Yeah.\n\nOkay. Yeah. Not even a hundred years. Right, exactly. So a hundred years ago, they were literally taking your skull and turning it into a hat.\n\nThey would\n\nPopping the cap off, the cap off and just, okay, yeah, let's see what this does exactly.\n\nThey would zap it. And what he noticed is that when he would zap right at the back of the brain, so this is the, this primary visual cortex that's receiving information from an environment, they would, this, his patients would say, oh, I see flashes of light. I see lines, I see colors with very simple kind of things. But then he would move forward to kind of higher levels that we know now are kind of high levels. And then they'd say, oh, I see triangles, or I see an orange circle, things like this. Then he'd keep going higher and higher. And then they'd say, oh, I see people, or I see cops and robbers. And then right at the top you reach an area called the hippocampus, which you may have heard of involved in memory. And the hippocampus basically keeps an eye, it's a bird's eye view of the all of this world model. Your brain is constructing and it's kind of following and looking for, you know, interesting or important patterns. And when he stimulated that, his patients would actually report memories. They would say, oh, I hear somebody talking to me. You know, this happened this morning when I was leaving the house. My mother was telling me something about, you know, you've got your coat on backwards or something like this. So you have these levels of, of the cortex that go from very simple, Kind of very funda, low level visual data at, at the bottom end. And then at the very top, you've got kind of higher order things such as, you know, faces or people. This is sitting at the top now. Interesting. Have you ever, when you are dreaming, right? So when you, let's think about dreaming for a second. It's quite instructive, I think, when you are dreaming, right, the brain is actually constructing the world in basically the same way as it does when you are awake. Dreams are kind of selective simulations of the waking world. The difference, of course is there's no sensory inputs. So if you scan someone's brain while they're having a dream, you'll see that this back of the brain, this primary visual cortex is kind of quiet. The brain is kind of using what it's learned about building the world in the normal waking state to construct the dream world. So the dream world is built in exactly, it's built from exactly the same stuff as the normal waking world. However, there's interesting features. If you in a dream, have you ever tried to use your cell phone or\n\nNo,\n\nNot many people have. What about read a book in a dream?\n\nI don't think so. One, one thing I have learned to do is to, I think I saw it in a movie. If you knock on a door, you'll realize that you're in a dream.\n\nAnd this waking life,\n\nI don't remember what movie it was, but it was a, a guy who was instructing how to lucid dream. And that if you make a habit of walking through a doorway in your home, and every time you walk in through a doorway in your home, tap on the door, the doorway, knock on it with your hand and say, am I awake? Knock, knock, knock. And then you'll get in a habit of doing that every time you go through a doorway. And if you go through a doorway in your dream, you'll do it. You'll say, am I awake? And then as you go to knock, knock, knock, you're like, oh shit, I'm dreaming. There we go. And then you realize, and if you don't give into astonishment, you can maintain that dream. You can that dream, right? It's, that's the thing. It's like, oh my God, I'm dreaming. I can't believe this. And then you wake up, right? You get too freaked out and you wake up. But if you don't do it, and I've only been able to do this a few times 'cause I don't really knock. I did it for a while after the movie. I saw the movie, I tried it for a while, and I did have a dream like that where I went through a doorway and I said, am I dreaming? And I'm like, oh my God, I'm dreaming. And then I, I realized I was dreaming, and then I was like flying. I was doing a lot of weird stuff. But then it went away, and then I stopped doing it. And I've always been like, wow, why don't I practice lucid? I'm, I've always, I've thought about it like a dozen times at least. Like, why don't I just get a book on lucid dreaming and really try to attempt to learn the techniques and, and I never do. Yeah,\n\nIt takes commitment. But now there's actually a simpler way of that kind of reality tests. A simpler way now is to get out your cell phone, occasionally open up the, the calculator and do a, do a few calculations and just check everything's working right? Or open up a book and, and try to read it. Because the thing about the dream world is, again, just like the normal waking world, it's, it's, it's constructed over kind of levels of a hierarchy from the highest level models. So your brain can construct a high level model of a, a cell phone quite easily. But all of the fine details of how it functions, that's all represented at the lowest level of the cortex. That's really dependent on sensory inputs. So you can dream of having your mobile phone in your hand and doing with it, but as soon as you try to do something with it through, actually your brain has to kind of construct that function. And it do, it can't do it unless it has access to sensory inputs. And so that's how you can test if you are lucid dreaming. Okay. Yeah. And, and which is why the DMT state is so fascinating is because it's, it's nothing like the dream state. People say, you know, that, that perhaps DMT is released when you are dreaming and that it actually triggers, I mean, this, this goes back to the 1980s. There's a, a, a, a theoretical paper published by a guy called Jace Callaway. And he said, oh, maybe DMT could be produced during REM sleep because it's closely related to melatonin, structurally both kind of tryptamine structures. But when you analyze the, the phenomenology, you know, the actual experience of DMT, it's nothing like dreaming. You know, dreaming is generally the brain making use of what it knows about how to construct the world in the waking state and doing so in the dream state. So that's why if you ask people, you know, that many studies have on dreaming have shown that people, when they dream, they dream about people, they dream about dogs and cats, they dream about, you know, the, the amount of time they spend talking on the telephone or watching TV is actually similar to what it is in waking life. So dreaming is more like a selective simulation of the waking world. It's not that difficult to explain because your brain, from the moment you were born, your brain was learning to construct the world as a model of the environment. This is, this world is the only world that your brain knows how to build or should know how to build. And yet when you introduce this molecule, dimethyl tryptamine into the brain, the brain suddenly starts constructing a world it never learned to construct. It's like the brain is build, speaking a language it never learned to speak and doing so flawlessly. These worlds are of beautiful crystalline clarity, perfectly finessed, staggeringly complex narrative complexity that I think is very difficult to explain. There's no simple explanation of why the brain should, should, should suddenly become capable of constructing these worlds. Unless, unless, and this is where things become more contentious. We are indeed interfacing with some kind of intelligence. That's my, that's the explanation that makes sense to me is that somehow DMT is gating access to some kind of, that the flow of information from some kind of intelligent agent that is directing the DMT experience. So it's not a sensed world, it's not a kind of a dreamt world. It's actually a directed world. I always say you don't break through into the DMT world. The DMT world breaks through into you. It's like this intelligent agent has commandeered your neural machinery, the world building machinery of your brain and is is directing everything that you see. It has complete control.\n\nIt's interesting that you use the word construct rather than observe. So you're using, you're using terminology that seems to indicate that you believe that you're constructing reality. Yes. Not that you're just observing reality.\n\nNo, because it's not, if you think about perception in the same way of like looking like a video camera, just taking imagery, images of the world, that's not how it works. The brain must actively construct a model of of, of the environment. That's all what it's always doing. It's always constructing a model. And it is constantly using that model to make predictions about the way that kind of predictions about the, the evolution of sensory information. It's constantly saying, okay, if this is, if this model that I'm currently using is good, then this should happen next. This is the pattern of sensory information that I should receive next. So if I, for example, move this bottle of water across your, your perceptual field, even if you close your eyes, you could probably tell me where the water's gonna be in a couple of seconds because it's, it's moving. Your brain has a model of the water and it is using that to make predictions. And it's only when something surprising happens. You know, if the water, if I do this and your brain detects that there's something, its predictions start to fail and you get these error signals and these are what flow into the brain. And the brain uses then to kind of update its model until the errors decline. So you'll never, you never have direct access to the world or to the environment, should I say. You only have direct access to this model that your brain is constructing. Mm.\n\nThat's where it gets weird. Mm. Because I'm assuming your model and my model are very similar.\n\nRight?\n\nThat would be if we could ever get to a ch a, a point where we could at least temporarily enter into someone else's consciousness and see how they see the world. Yeah. I think we're gonna get a lot of answers where we're gonna be like, oh, you guys live in a totally different fucking world. No wonder why you think we should be communists and we should, you\n\nKnow, like, well, it's true. Yeah.\n\nI mean, every, whatever your chemical makeup is, your life experience, your biology, whatever contributing factors. I, I'm as I always assume that your construction of the world is the same as my construction of the world. But every now and then I'll get a text message from a friend about some world event. And their take is so crazy that I'll just go to go, wow, this person is living in a completely different world than me. I\n\nMean, they are, they are. I mean, yeah, I mean their, their brain, the structure of their brain, the organization of their neural networks and it's all different in everyone. Everyone has a unique brain. And so in a sense, everyone has to construct an entirely unique model of reality. But we agree on certain things. We reach this kind of consensus about what we call things. But we, you know, if I point at, you know, something that, that television Yeah, I can say that. Oh, there's, I can describe the colors, I can describe the people, but again, we're all using our own personally constructed model. Yeah. And that's what we experience.\n\nWell that's what's weird, you know, 'cause we, again, it's just this assumption. So your, your take is that when you're dreaming, you are trying to construct this world and that you don't really have the tools to leave a book where you can read, you don't have the tools to use a calculator. You just know what a calculator is. And so if you're in, in the absence of an actual calculator, your brain's not capable of creating one.\n\nYeah. So, so, so again, you have at the, the highest level, you have a cal a calculator model, which is kind of a broad idea of a calculator. It doesn't have all the details. All the details are at the lower end. Actually we can show this can, sorry, Jamie, can I use Jamie like this? Sure.\n\nAnytime.\n\nCan you go to the picture of Margaret Thatcher? Yeah. The problem,\n\nI was gonna bring this up in some way. I think it's supposed to play a video. Maybe\n\nNot yet. Well,\n\nThe videos don't seem to be playing in the keynote. There's three or four of 'em and none of them play.\n\nOh really?\n\nYeah. I figured you were going to get here at some point.\n\nOh, okay.\n\nI don't know how to, it's, it's just a,\n\nIs it formatted for windows? No, no.\n\nLet me go. Oh, go, go\n\nBack. I didn't know that was gonna happen. Okay. Okay.\n\nSo perfect. Alright. Okay. So go back one. Okay. This is kind of really interesting, right?\n\nYeah. I've\n\nSeen this. You've seen this, right? Yes. This\n\nIs really not with Margaret Thatcher, but I've seen it with other faces.\n\nYeah. So the original was with Margaret Thatcher. Right.\n\nLet's explaining to people that are just listening. 'cause it's still quite a lot of people. So this\n\nIs called the Thatcher Effect. So when you are looking at this image of Margaret Thatcher or anyone, your brain is constructing a model of this person, right? A model of their, their face. And as I said, it's constructed over a hierarchy. So you have the overall idea, the overall concept of Margaret Thatcher, right? The whole face. Right. The whole thing. Right. And then you have a lower level, you have the eyes and the mouth and the nose, and they're kind of separate and then go going further still within the eyes. You've got circles and patches of color and all this stuff. And right at the bottom you have this really messy system of lines and things that don't make any sense. Right. And you can actually show how this hierarchy is constructed. At the moment it's, it just looks like Margaret Thatcher and it's, you can't really break it down. But if you flip over like this, so just leave it there for a second, Jamie, please. Yeah. So now you see what we've done is we've basically, we've weakened this highest level model right. Of the whole face. Because the brain isn't very good at building models of faces that are upside down. Right? Okay. And so this looks, there's something wrong with the image clearly,\n\nBut it looks like Margaret Thatcher. Absolutely.\n\nIt looks like Margaret Thatcher. But it's actually what's happened is the whole face has been flipped over, but the mouth and the eyes are actually the correct way up. Right? Right. But to the brain in this configuration, it's not that surprising because the eyes kind of look as they should. The mouth looks as it should.",

It's called the Thatcher effect.\n\nIt's So was she the original person that they used this idea? Exactly. That's why, who came up with this? Who?\n\nOh, good question. But this is fairly old now. I think at least a couple of decades old.\n\nIt's so funny that they figured that out. It's a, a great insight into how the mind works because the upside down Thatcher with the upside down with the correct eyeballs and mouth. The second one, Jamie, that does not look crazy at all. No, that's what's so weird about the third image. 'cause the third image really looked psychotic. Like if it was a monster movie Yeah. And then someone got bitten by a zombie and then that was what they looked like. And then they came running after you and be like, oh fuck she got bit. Yeah,\n\nExactly.\n\nHer eyeballs are upside down. Her mouth is upside down. 'cause that's what it looks like. Yeah. Weird. Like the, for people listening, the big teeth, you're above teeth. They're, they're below and the little tiny teeth are above and the eyeballs are the eyelids, the top part are on the bottom and it really looks like a monster. Yeah. And it's weird that it looks like a monster 'cause it looks so damn normal. Upside down. Yeah,\n\nExactly.\n\nWeird.\n\nSo yeah, it's just, it's, it's, it's revealing this hierarchy, this structure of, of this world model that your brain is always constructing. You see,\n\nThat's a good way to describe why it's constructing rather than observing. Right. That's clearly an am example of your constructing normalcy and that upside down face. It's not normal at all. It's not normal\n\nAt all.\n\nRight? Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. So do we know what's going on when you're dreaming? Is it potentially, is there a release of DMT? 'cause DMT is exogenously, it's produced in the brain, it's produced in the liver and the lungs. Right. It's produced, produced a lot of other areas. So we know the body makes it right. Yeah. And we also know that melatonin plays a role and there's a lot of other things going on. Is it possible that DMT is one of the ingredients in the soup?

Because the pineal gland has this long history and mystical traditions, the seat of the soul, the third eye, all this kind of stuff. So everyone wants DMT to produce to be produced by the pineal gland. Yeah. The problem is, is first of all is that the pineal gland is very small. It's about the size of the end of my, my pinky. And it's designed or evolved to produce nanograms micrograms of melatonin. Very small amounts you need. So the idea that this gland can suddenly start pumping out milligrams of DMT to achieve a kind of psychedelic state in the dream state is, is quite an ask. There have, there have been some studies, or one study in particular actually looked at DMT level. So we've known since the 1950s that DMT is produced by is a product of mammalian physiology and it's produced by humans. In, in those days, they tried to kind of pin schizophrenia on DMT. Right? The idea that if there was some fault, some problem with tryptamine metabolism, instead of producing serotonin, which is five hydroxy tryptamine, the brain could instead start producing elevated levels of an end dimethyl tryptamine or DMT. And so they started looking for differences in DMT levels in psychotic patients, schizophrenic patients versus normal people. And there've been more than a hundred studies that have looked at levels of DMT and the, in the blood, in urine, in cerebral spinal fluid. But there's, there's no convincing consistent evidence that suggests that DMT is the cause Right. Of psychosis or dreaming, in fact,\n\nCan I, in endogenous production? Yeah. What, what are the, what's the mechanism? Like what is producing it?\n\nOkay, so it's actually produced from tryptophan. So DMT is an alkaloid, and alkaloids are all produced from amino acids. So tryptophan is first converted to tryptamine. This is called de decarboxylation. You remove a carbon dioxide molecule and you've got tryptamine. Now here you can go in a number of different directions. You can go to serotonin, which is five hydroxy tomine, or you can go to DMT. You just simply add to methyl groups, to carbon atoms. And\n\nSo what is adding these things?\n\nSo there's an enzyme called indole, eth lamine and methyl transferase or INMT for short. This is the key enzyme for DMT production. It adds these two groups, these methyl groups to tryptamine, which is produced from tryptophan to produced DMT and\n\nTryptophan is produced from.\n\nSo it's tryptophan is one of the essential amino acids. So it's, it is something you consume.\n\nDo you, do people take tryptophan as a dietary supplement in order to increase the potency of their experiences?\n\nSome people do. I don't think it would have an appreciable effect. Okay. I mean, people take tryptophan for, for, for lots of reasons.\n\nSo this process, what makes you think that this is a size dependent process? Because if, just because this gland is so tiny, why can't it do it?\n\nOkay. Well there's a number of things. First of all, it's, it's, it's just, there's orders of magnitude. I mean, a gland that is designed to produce nanograms or micrograms of something or ask it to produce a thousand times more of an entirely different molecule is quite an ask. However, that's not the only reason that there's actually been a study recently in the last, I think three or four years that looked at DMT levels in rat brains in real time. They're not in humans, but in rat brains, they actually have a technique now called microdialysis where they can basically measure in awake an awake moving, you know, normally behaving rat. They can measure the levels of DMT in its brain. And what they found was that the levels of DMT, first of all were surprisingly high. So similar levels to things like serotonin and dopamine, which\n\nIs unusual,\n\nWhich is yes. Which makes you think that it must have some kind of function. But importantly, they also, in some rats, they remove the pineal gland. They kind of cut it out and found that it didn't affect. So we don't need the pineal. In other words, all brain cells, all neurons can probably produce DMT, the lungs can almost certainly produce DMT.\n\nWhy do you think that the pineal gland had this role in ancient mysticism? Why did they have this appreciation of it as being this very sacred organ? That, I mean is, I mean, it's the eye of Horace. Right? Right. I mean, certainly looks like it, it looked like the eye of Horace looks exactly like a cross section of the pineal gland.\n\nYeah. I mean, it sits right in the center of the brain as well. Right. So it, and it looks, it's kind of unusual, as you say, it looks like a little tiny pine\n\nCurtain. Like how did they, where did they come up? It's whenever this, I mean, it's, it's very easy to dismiss Mm. Like ancient mysticism and ancient ideas of what, what things are sacred about, you know, the human body and what, what, what areas of the mind are producing these, the third eye, like that's how it was always described. But I, I don't want to, I I, it's too weird. So I, I I go wait a minute before you dismiss. 'cause it's fun to dismiss things like, oh, they didn't know anything. Like, how do we know that they weren't onto something? Like maybe there is a role that that plays in not normal DMT production, but in the big dump that you get before you die. Right. And then you have a near-death experience. Yeah. Maybe that has to be, maybe that's the kill switch. Maybe that's the big dump switch. You know what I mean? Like, if, like,\n\nNo one's ever put it like that before. Because if\n\nYou think about, it's the seat of the soul, right? If, if that is where the soul is like connected, that's where the soul is like anchored into this physical reality. And if you're gonna dive, you have a near-death experience. Something has gotta go, all right boys, this is not a drill. Let it go. And then, I mean, that's what a lot of people think is happening. They do. Yeah. Yeah. When people have near death experiences, there's a lot of very bizarre aspects of it. But one of 'em is the uniformity of their experiences. It's a lot of very similar experiences, very similar. You know, you have with anything, you have variables that people may or may not be adding onto their own, because people love to tell a good tale, you know? And why miss out on a chance when you've had a near death experience that was profound to maybe add a little to it, make it a little bit more exciting. But the overall kind of framework of the experience is very similar. And I often wonder like, what is that? Like I, I have a friend who was in a car accident and had a near death experience and said that when they came back, they had no fear. Like, for that moment, I think of fear now, but like, no fear at all about dying, no fear at all about life. And that this was this very weird transformative journey where they went to another place and then they returned. But it was very real. It felt very to the point where all of their anxiety, even about the car accident being knocked unconscious and all that stuff all went away.\n\nYeah. I think the, the, the near death experience connection to DMT is, is very interesting because Rick Strassman, of course, in the nineties when he wrote DMT, the spirit molecule, he hypothesized that in fact, the point of death DMT is released by the penile and it kind of acts as the conduit by which you, you the soul exits the body and enters the afterlife. Yeah. And of course that was, you know, largely speculation. It was just a hypothesis. But in recent years, there's been some really fascinating work showing that DMT actually, if you, if you take some neurons, a culture of neurons, for example, brain cells, which are very sensitive to oxygen levels. So if you deprive neurons of oxygen, they die very quickly. This is why strokes can be so rapidly devastating. If the brain becomes deprived of blood and oxygen, then the brain cells start to die. But in the presence of DMT, they live a lot longer. So they're kind of protecting the, the, the brain against hypoxia. Now, when does the brain enter a hypoxic state during the dying process, right? This is when as your cardiovascular system starts to collapse, your respiratory system collapses. The brain becomes deprived of oxygen. And this is precisely the time when you want the brain to be flooded with DMT, just in case you come back to protect the brain from the, the lack of oxygen. So that suggests a clear and obvious link. And if you kill rats, actually again, I was referring to this microdialysis experiment. If you kill a rat whilst measuring DMT levels, well as the rat dies, the DMT levels spike. Mm. So it suggests that the rat is also maybe having a\n\nTripping balls\n\nAn actual death experience. Yeah. I\n\nWonder if they come back as a person. Yeah. Come back to that.\n\nBut\n\nIt does suggest,\n\nRight, it does suggest that there is maybe some link there, but what it doesn't explain of course, is, you know, why you would need, why this molecule would be, does why this molecule would be so profoundly visionary. Right? That's still a kind of a mystery, you know, are you gi being kind of given access to wherever you go right after death? You know, is is there a vision of, of, of, of what happens to you later on? That's\n\nA but the question to me, my question rather is, but not it's, are we sure it's a vision or is it a gateway? Or is it, are you entering into a non-physical space that has its own laws that it's very different? But it is a reality, and it's not that it's a vision that, not that it's a hallucination or a visionary representation, or that you're even constructing this reality, but you're, you're entering into a completely different dimension that has laws that are very different than the dimension that we find ourselves in right now.\n\nOkay. So what I think is that, I don't think with DMT that you are going anywhere as such. I think, You know, as I said, the the world you're experience is always represented in the brain. And that must apply I think in the DMT state. If you, if you're experiencing an altered world, there must be some repu representation of that within your cortical machinery, within your cortex, within your brain. I think that has to be the case. However, I don't think, and I think it's a, a great mystery is, is how the brain is actually capable of constructing that on its own in the same way that the brain constructs the dream world. Because the brain knows how to construct the waking world. So it's, it's simply using its stored models. The same with hallucinations. If you look at case reports of hallucinations in psychotics, you go through the psychiatric literature, the vast majority of hallucinations are normal appearing normal sized people, normal animals that it's like waking dreams, if you like. But with DMT, it's not your, the brain is somehow constructing a world that has no relationship whatsoever. Nothing is taken right from the normal waking world. It's like the brain is, is suddenly has switched to speaking a language that it never learned. And I think that suggests that actually what's happening is you're not going somewhere, but you are in this more kind of fluid and dynamic state that psychedelics induce. You are kind of, you are making the brain much more sensitive to being commandeered. I think it's a, an, I think what you're seeing is what this intelligent agent, as I recall, as I tend to call it, I don't call it spirits or aliens or anything like that. I think there's some, it's clear to me that there's some kind of intelligence and that intelligence is interacting with our brain in some way and, and showing us kind of what it wants us to see, if you like.",

I think there's some, it's clear to me that there's some kind of intelligence and that intelligence is interacting with our brain in some way and, and showing us kind of what it wants us to see, if you like.\n\nDoes that assume that consciousness resides in the brain though? Or is, I mean, when you take into account the possibility of consciousness being something that the brain tunes into and that it forms its own version of reality based on its biology, its life experiences, et cetera, et cetera, but that it is just a radio and it is just forming its version of consciousness, but that it, it is actually tuning into consciousness. And that consciousness is sort of a universal thing that exists not just in people, but maybe in other life forms as well. Certainly animals and maybe plants. So one of the weirder things about people who trip, I'm sure you know this, is they experience communication from plants. Like tree hugging becomes a real thing. Yeah, I know. Like tree hugging is a very different thing. It's like, oh, you're alive. Hello. You know, and we know that trees and plants in general, like especially house plants, when people interact with them, they grow better. They, they, they're healthier plants. Like you can prove it. It's interesting. You play music for them, communicate with them, say nice things. We also know that plants in like abusive households where people are alcoholics and cigarette smoke, they do, they're gonna do terrible.\n\nYeah. I think that as soon as I start talking about, first of all, I, I, I think consciousness is absolutely fundamental. I don't think that the brain generates consciousness. I think consciousness is in some way the only thing that really exists. You know, I think that it's the fun, it's the absolute ultimate reality is consciousness itself. Do\n\nYou think everything is conscious? I\n\nThink everything is consciousness.\n\nEverything is consciousness. Interesting. Yeah. Do you think there's a state that may be inanimate objects achieve that is very different than our interpretation of consciousness, but yet they're still conscious,\n\nI think in, in, in,\n\nWhich is why, 'cause I say this 'cause Jamie has OJ Simpson's golf clubs. I feel like they have some consciousness attached to them.\n\nI mean,\n\nI mean it's probably bad, right? You know, those times\n\nDidn't exist in the nineties. They were like only 10 years\n\nOld.

I think, you know, what do we mean by when something's conscious in, in, in Buddhism they have this, they have this idea of things that exist from their own side, which I really like, you\n\nKnow, from their own side.\n\nYes. So you exist from your own side. In other words, Presumably, and I can never prove it, there is someone, a subjective perspective there that's actually modeling, you know, that it's experiencing in me. And I'm, and and Jamie as well. Everyone has is like a perspective, you know, I exist from my own side, right? Whereas does this skull exist from its own side? Is is, does it have its own unique perspective? I would say probably not, but I don't know. And right. Consciousness is kind of like the interaction, you know, reality kind of emerges by, by the interaction of all of these perspective, these conscious agents, if you like everyone, all these points of subjective perspective, I think that's probably closer to what ultimate reality is. But I think it's very difficult. You know, I'm a neuroscientist, so I focus on not consciousness per se, but on what I can get my teeth into. I can get my teeth into the content, into the structure, the actual meat and potatoes, right? Of never used that phrase before. That's a good phrase. The meat. Yeah. The meat and potatoes of the DMT experience. Things that I can talk about and analyze. That's, you know, I'm, what I'm trying to do, I think is, I'm, I'm not trying to tell people what I think DMT is. I'm just trying to convince them that it's not what they think it is. That it's not just hallucination, that it's not, these are not dreams. That kind of thing. I\n\nReally feel like to be talking about the subject, you should experience it, like I said before, before. Oh, I agree. I think it's so silly that there's very serious people that are academics, that are brilliant people that are dancing around what this thing is without doing it.\n\nRight.\n\nI've never met anybody who's done it, who comes back and goes, eh,\n\nYeah, no, it's impossible to do No big\n\nDeal.\n\nI was, no, it's, it's, I was interacting with a guy on Twitter and Ex who referred to entity encounters as illusory social events, ISEs, which to me was just the most absurd watered down. I mean, this guy had obviously never encountered a fucking DMT entity or he wouldn't. But the idea that this is just an illusory social event just seemed to me absurd. And\n\nHad he had any experiences,\n\nI I, I very much doubt and he was from a neuroscientist.\n\nBut here's the thing, sometimes people have low dose experiences. Like I had talked to a friend once that had a very, I'm like, how many hits did you take? And they're like, one, I'm like, oh yeah, you need two more. You need two more. You need two more.\n\nTake the third hit.\n\nYeah, you missed the gate. You didn't hit the gate. You're on the outside going, this place is kind of weird. Yeah, yeah. But if you go through, it's a lot weirder than you think.\n\nIt's a lot weirder than you think. Yeah. Yeah. Oh, it's, I think it's a lot weirder than Terence McKenna. Would you say you know, stranger than you can suppose?\n\nI suppose.\n\nYeah.\n\nHe had a really amazing video that, I think I posted it on my Instagram of McKenna, like in the 1990s, I believe it was talking about the upcoming decades and what's going to happen in terms of how weird the world is going to be with technological innovation and what we're going to be seeing artificial intelligence, alien contacting, I mean, he basically nailed it. Yep. I mean, fucking nailed it. He nailed it to a t I think he might've predicted time travel, but here's the thing. If they are capable of time travel, when are you gonna find out about it? When are they gonna, if, if, let's say DARPA is working on some defense project and part of it involves like, you know, one way to stop a war would be literally to go back in time, five minutes and kill everybody who was about to start the war. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Right. You\n\nKnow, kill Hitler, that kind of\n\nIdea. Yeah. Or, or stop a bomb from being switched on. You would literally go back in time and stop the bomb, stop the missiles from launching. Would you, when would we learn about that? When would, first of all, it very highly unlikely that it exists outside of the quantum stage right now. Right. I get it. But if it did, if we were talking about a hundred years from now, or 200, would we know we would not, do you want me to play it? Yes. This is it. This is it. This is amazing. I love this. First of all, I'd just love his voice. Had a guy in the best voice\n\nAnd is going to rise excruciatingly even beyond the excruciating present levels of contradiction. So I think it's just going to get weirder and weirder and weirder. And finally, it's going to be so weird that people are going to have to talk about how weird it is. And at that point, novelty theory can come out of the woods because eventually people are gonna say, what the hell is going on? It's just too nuts. It's not enough to say it's nuts. You have to explain why it's so nuts. I look for the invention of artificial life. The cloning of human beings. Probably check a possible contact with extraterrestrial, probably check is possible human immortality. And at the same time, appalling acts of brutality, genocide, race, baiting, homophobia, famine, starvation. Because the systems which are in place to keep the world sane are in utterly inadequate to the forces that have been unleashed. The collapse of the socialist world, the rise of the internet, these are changes so immense. Nobody could imagine them ever happening. And now that they have happened, nobody even bothers to mention what a big deal it is. The mushroom said to me once, it said, this is what it's like when a species prepares to depart for the stars. You don't depart for the stars under calm and orderly conditions. It's a fire in a madhouse. And that's what we have the fire in the madhouse at the end of time. This is what it's like when a species prepares to move on to the next dimension. The entire destiny of all life on the planet is tied up in this. We are not acting for ourselves or from ourselves. We are, we happen to be the point species on a transformation that will affect every living organism on this planet at its conclusion.\n\nNailed it. I think that's exactly what's going on right now. The only thing that he didn't quite get is the artificial intelligence aspect. How much of a factor, but I mean, how could you predict all that in 1998?\n\nI think with, you know, we, we live in a very thin sliver. If you look at the development of an intelligent civilization, right? Over hundreds of thousands of years, we live in this, this thin sliver, this kind of technological phase. And once you enter that phase that we are in now, you know, the computer aids, the information age or whatever it is, you are probably only a few hundred years away from Departing for the stars or something like this of complete or even completely transcending our biology. And this isn't a crazy idea anymore. You know, many sensible astrobiologists and other intelligence theorists think yes, probably what's going to happen in the next few hundred years is that we will become post biological. Yeah. And so if you think about the universe more broadly, if we are looking for aliens, quote unquote aliens as being kind of wet brained, wet bodied biological beings, we're probably only looking for a tiny fraction of the intelligence in the cosmos. And the vast majority of intelligence in the cosmos is likely to be post biological, to have completely dispensed with the biological form. Now what's interesting about that, Jamie, sorry, there's an, have you heard of, you've heard of the card chef scale, right? I don't think so. What is it? So the card chef scale was generated by a guy called card chef, and he was Soviet guy, and he kind of hype theorized of as intelligences progress and develop, they go through a number of phases. So you have a type zero. Okay, I have heard the scale. Yeah, you've got it. Right. So we are kind of a type zero level one on the Cardiff scale. And then level two, sorry, we're level zero. So level one would be when we, for example, are able to harness all of the energy from our neighboring star, then the next level when we can harness all the energy from the galaxy, et cetera. So it's, it's, it's an expansionist way of thinking about it. The idea of climbing the Cardish chef scale. There we go. You see? Yeah. But in the 1990s, a British cosmologist called John Barrow, he said, actually, if you actually look at how an intelligent civilization such as ourselves, the only one we know, we actually spend a lot more time going not to larger and larger scales, but smaller and smaller scales, right? We go down to, you know, doing chemistry, the large Hadron Collider, we're looking at the structure of atoms, and then the, the structure of subatomic particles and that kind of thing. We're actually spending more time and more energy and more money going deeper and deeper. Now, the reason that's significant is because if you take the, the human sits in the middle, if you take the scale of a human, and then you compare the scale of a human to the scale, let's say the hydrogen atom, and then you compare it to the scale of the observable, observable universe, humans sit almost exactly in the middle of that scale from the hydrogen atom to the observable universe. But below the hydrogen atom, there is probably a hundred million to a billion times more scale, deeper and deeper down. Richard Feynman, the Nobel, you know, the legendary physicist always used to say, there's, there's plenty of room at the bottom. There's much more room at the bottom. In other words, as an intelligent species, an intelligent civilization progresses, they're not likely to kind of become space fairing as such, you know, and kind of exploring the cosmos. They're much more likely to go deep down and kind of instant instantiate themselves at the lowest levels of reality. That's where all the space is. It's not out there, surprisingly, all the space is downwards. Now, once an intelligence achieves that, and you have to imagine that probably there are probably billions of these civilizations that had had already achieved this before we even popped into existence, before we, you know, evolved as a species, they would effectively disappear. They would, they would become effectively part of the fabric of, of space time itself exploiting the fundamental computational structure of the lowest level of, of reality, basically. And that's where they reside.",

      "transcript_chunk": "ist always used to say, there's, there's plenty of room at the bottom. There's much more room at the bottom. In other words, as an intelligent species, an intelligent civilization progresses, they're not likely to kind of become space fairing as such, you know, and kind of exploring the cosmos. They're much more likely to go deep down and kind of instant instantiate themselves at the lowest levels of reality. That's where all the space is. It's not out there, surprisingly, all the space is downwards. Now, once an intelligence achieves that, and you have to imagine that probably there are probably billions of these civilizations that had had already achieved this before we even popped into existence, before we, you know, evolved as a species, they would effectively disappear. They would, they would become effectively part of the fabric of, of space time itself exploiting the fundamental computational structure of the lowest level of, of reality, basically. And that's where they reside. And there are probably far, far more, probably millions or billions more of those types of civilizations than there are ones, like I say, you and me, like us as humans, right? And so then you ask, well, if that's the case, you know, if we are interested in contacting, so quote unquote extraterrestrials, why are we focused on this tiny subpopulation of beings that are likely to be, you know, floating around in metallic discs or whatever. We should in fact be focusing on the, the much more abundant ones that are perhaps at the deepest levels of reality. And how would we do that? How would an intelligence that has completely transcended its biology and even completely transcended its physical form entirely? How would such an intelligence communicate with us? It would do it through our brain. That's the most obvious thing. Because the brain is how we interact with the environment. It's how we interact. It's the interface by which we interact with what there is. And I think DMT I'm not saying that these DMT entities are necessarily these post biological beings, but it's not out of the question. I'm not straying too far from fairly standard now modern scientific discourse. When I say that it's perfectly possible that there are very large numbers of these supremely intelligent civilizations that are everywhere and nowhere, and that we can somehow interact with using our brain. And that DMT generates this kind of highly susceptible, highly sensitive neurological state that allows us to interact with them. This is why perhaps when you go into the DMT space, it's immediately obvious, it's undeniable, undeniably apparent that you are interacting with some kind of supremely advanced intelligence. Could that be some intelligence that has existed long before we arrived on the sea? And that we are now kind of discovering this technology and I, I consider DMTT to be some kind of technology that we have discovered that we are now learning to use to interact with these intelligent agents that perhaps have been here for forever in human terms.\n\nThe, it's an interesting term, the term go there. Mm. You know, because that's what it feels like. Yeah. It feels like you're, you're traveling somewhere, like you're going somewhere. But the reality is that place that you're going is probably right here. Yes. That's where it gets weird because it's around you all the time. You just don't have the ability to tune into it all the time because you wouldn't be able to function if you did.\n\nExactly. And, and these beings, they probably don't even have a true form that you could represent visually. Right. Right. So when you see an insectoid alien or a machine now, you're probably not seeing, or almost certainly, I've\n\nNever seen a machine now. Oh, really? Have you?\n\nI've seen, I dunno if I've seen the, the archetypal kind of McKenna McKenna of McKenna\n\nMachine out. Yeah. The way you described it was very odd. But\n\nI've seen certainly a multitude of beings. Very, very kind of srey squeaky. Yeah. Like jabbering, jabbering.\n\nYou know, I saw once a bunch of jokers giving me the finger, ah, they were all giving me the finger, and they're going, fuck you. And they were jokers with like little tassels on with the bells in the end of it. Right. And it made me very aware that I was taking myself too seriously. And they were like, yep, yep. And they said it to me and they pointed their finger at me like that. I was like, you're right. Yeah.\n\nIt's interesting, actually, it reminded me of something. There's this weird effect that people who, who use DMTA lot, they get this, you know, they might use DMT regularly and, and, and one day they, they take a hit as they normally do with the same batch of DMT, and they get a joker or a jester, and it wags its finger and says, not today, you've\n\nDone too much.\n\nYep, exactly. I've heard that before. Yeah. And it shuts off. A guy wrote to me and says that he, he saw a jester, as he often does, and it fucking punched him in the face. And he felt it, he felt, and it knocked him back into this world. And so the, the effect was gone. Oh, wow. Instantaneously. Now that is not easy to explain because it, this is not tolerance. DMT first of all doesn't exhibit subjective tolerance, unlike the other psychedelics. It's kind of weird. You can inject someone with DMT every 30 minutes perpetually, and they will, the intensity of their experience will always be the same. Yeah. It's not a tolerance and tolerance anyway, is a gradual thing. It increases gradually over time. Right. So it's not an off switch. I was speaking to someone, we, we are probably gonna talk about DMTX later, which is kind of my thing. But she was undergoing DMTX, which is this infusion where they, they keep the brain level of DMT constant and she, that's\n\nA tease to the big buildup Yes. Of DMTX. There\n\nWe go. Yeah. And she was in the DMT space interacting, the infusion machine was running, pumping her brain with DMT at constant rate, keeping the DMT levels in her brain constant. And she's interacting with these entities. And then at some point after maybe, you know, 30 minutes or whatever, when the machine was still running, they said to her, or impressed upon her, they said, okay, we we're done, we're done today. And the visions stopped. Whoa. But the machine, the brain was still being pumped with DMT, and yet the visions stopped. So what that suggests to me is that they do, indeed, as I said before, they have control. They are directing the information into the brain. And people, you know, described things like downloads in Graham Hancock. Actually, in, in his book Supernatural, in his first DMT experience, he described this, this download of highly complex, entirely non-human information into his brain as if he locked in to some kind of advanced computational processor that was, that was beaming information into his, his brain. And many people described that as like a download and of, of, of, of complex mathematical structures and strains, geometries, entirely, entirely non-human stuff. As if there's kind of, not that they expect you to understand it, but as if to say, you know, we know a lot more about reality than you do. We know a lot and you don't know anything. And that's the message they're kind of trying to impress upon you by directing it. And they can control it. They can, they can shut it off if they so, so decide.\n\nHmm.

Whatever it is. Whatever it is. Yeah. This idea that we all evolve along a similar pathway is strange to me that the concept is we assume that intelligent life everywhere else evolves along similar pathways. And that most of them eventually become some sort of a biological digital hybrid, if not completely digital. And then most of them probably figure out how to harness the power of the star and the suns. But one of the, the weird thing about us is that not just that we are evolving and that we have evolved, but yet we have this, but that rather we have this insatiable desire for technological innovation. Technological innovation, and to make things better. We're constantly improving upon everything we make. We're making better versions of every computer, every phone, every year. Even though it's not really necessary for most people, you're always buying them. It, it's a very strange desire that we have that I think sinks hand in glove to materialism. Because materialism is also still so stupid for an intelligent life form that has a finite lifespan to not be aware that collecting things does you no good 'cause you're gonna die. Like, but yet you want to collect things more than anything. And you wanna show people the things you've collected. Well, what better way to facilitate innovation and growth than to have a built in instinct for purchasing better things all the time and possessing better things all the time, which will force people to work literally into the grave Yeah. In order to get these things done.\n\nYeah. I think it's, it's psychotic. Yeah,\n\nIt is. But that, that's just us. Yeah. Like, it doesn't have to be like that. If you think about the hundreds of billions of stars just in this galaxy, the hundreds of billions of galaxies in the known universe, the, the endless possibilities of when intelligent life emerged, if in fact it did emerge anywhere, we have no evidence it emerged anywhere else but here. Right. We're just guessing. Mm. We assume. But if we were right, like it could have taken infinite number of forms, it could have evolved completely non-physical. Yeah. Like intelligent life that's completely non-physical. That's not, it's not contained to a cellular structure and bones and organs that it's plasma based. That it's some sort of in, in intelligence that communicates with some sort of a universal language. We, we don't, we're just guessing that everything's a monkey. We're just guessing. Everything's a curious monkey that keeps making a better spaceship. Yeah. Yeah. But that mind it be true. Which by the way, I went to the SpaceX, Jamie and I both did How dope. Sick. Pretty dope. We went to see the SpaceX launch. We were How far do you think we were? Were we a half a mile? Quarter of a mile? What do you think\n\nI call it a mile. A mile and a\n\nHalf. Maybe two miles. Oh, you think a mile More than a mile. Yeah. Really? Okay. Could have been. So let's say we're a mile away. Let's just guess. Well, let's just throw it in perplexity. I guess I can look. Throw it in perplexity. Ask our sponsor Perplexity. How far is the distance between Star base and the SpaceX rocket\n\nBetween the star base\n\nAnd the SpaceX Launchpad? Yeah, launchpad,\n\nSpaceX and Texas. Just to be specific.\n\nYeah. Because there's one in Florida as well. So they have their own town down there. It's like a legit town. It's like a military town. Like they took over a place like a, a military installation. These little tiny houses, fucking security everywhere. There's so many cyber trucks. If you have a cyber truck, you're fucked. You can't Fair enough. You have no idea. You better remember your parking spot.\n\nBitch.\n\nEverybody has a goddamn cyber truck.\n\nI estimated at less than one\n\nMile. See Okay. Right here. Okay. Main interest star base of the actual launch pad infrastructure. Estimated less than one mile public viewing sites. Okay. There's public viewing sites. Yeah. But we were there, we were at Star base, we were in a, like a public viewing site. We were at the actual rocket factory. And when that thing takes off, you feel it in your chest, it's nuts. So it's roughly a mile away and you have to wear earplugs. It's a mile away. Yeah. And you gotta wear earplugs and you feel it in your chest. And Elon's son was like, I wanna go home.\n\nLike,\n\nThere was a video, there's a video that I put and you could hear 'em in the background. It's so funny because my wife was like, were the babies Okay. 'cause women that have children, like they, they, that's the immediately what they go to. Not. Wow. That rocket's really cool. It's like, oh, are the baby's okay? Because she could hear 'em going, I wanna go, I wanna go. He was like, I wanna get outta here. Because it's that freaky, the power of it is just so nuts you that you feel, and then you see it and you realize like, God, how many people have seen a rocket launch? Like how crazy this thing's going into space. And then I went upstairs and I got to sit in the command console, or whatever you would call it, the command center. And I get with me and Elon and all the engineers, and we get to watch it land in Australia 35 minutes later. So we watch\n\n35 minutes Yes.\n\nFrom, yes, from from Texas, from Texas to Australia. Wow. It's crazy. And we're watching all these cameras in real time that are all connected to starlink satellites. So there's dozens of cameras. So you're watching about two miles is what this is. Oh, two miles straight across. Okay. It seems so close. It seemed really close. Okay. Two, even crazier. So two miles away in you feel it in your chest. It's nuts. I mean, it's really nuts. It's the power that it has is so nuts. But it's so old school, right? Yeah. It's just,\n\nYou know, it feels old fashioned in a weird kind of way.\n\nIt's the most modern version of like a V eight muscle car.\n\nIt's crazy. Right. If you think like a hundred years ago, at the end of the beginning of the 20th century, how different we would be in a hundred years as, you know, as we are now, it's, it's unfathomable. When you compare The rest of human history, it's, it's, it's like an exponential thing. You know, we, we've gradually been developing and technologically improving. And then we hit some point in the last century where we reach this kind of technological computer informational age, and everything is accelerating Exactly like Terrence McKenna was saying. Yes. Things speed up Right. Very, very quickly. And it feels like we're on the cusp either of killing ourselves, which is one option. Right. Or undergoing some profound transformation as a species, whether it be, whether it means becoming a spacefaring nation, sorry, a spacefaring civilization, or whether it means going in the opposite direction and becoming some kind of post biological civilization that exists beyond space and beyond time perhaps. And kind of joining the crowd of these intelligences that have made that transition perhaps billions of years ago.",

And kind of joining the crowd of these intelligences that have made that transition perhaps billions of years ago. You know, do\n\nYou think that this chaos is the only way that things get done? See, this is, this is my my thought. If everybody, everything's perfect and everything's wonderful and fine, there's very little motivation for radical change. And radical change is what you need to escape the primate instincts that we have. Yeah. As McKenna had the great quote of that, we're territorial apes with thermonuclear weapons. There we go. Yeah. It's such a perfect way to describe us. That is what we are. Right? So in order to escape that, things have to almost be so ca chaotic that it demands radical change. It, it demands, like you're, we were literally like, and this is how we look at many things. We, even things that aren't totally warranted, like climate change or COVID or anything. Like, we look at it like, oh my God, it's an existential crisis. Like, we have to do something right now. And this is how also we approach political dissent or political disagreements. If the left wing wins, the world is over. If the right wins, the world is over. And it's like this, like, it's almost like this is how we have to function in order to really get things done. And as things are getting more and more crazy in, in terms of technology and in terms of the consequences, consequences of our actions post nuclear bomb, post fusion, post HydroOne collider, post AI is where it gets really weird. We have to kind of be like, we, we really gotta get going guys. Yeah. We really gotta do something and we have to figure out what's the right way to proceed in order to not blow ourselves up. Yeah. Like how, and I feel like this is maybe the only way that you motivate this kind of extreme change, which seems like our destiny, our destiny is some sort of a very bizarre extreme change. Mm. That seems to probably be happening within your, your and my lifetime. Something's happening right now that is gonna be different than anything that's ever happened before, which is the birth of artificial general super intelligence right in front of our eyes. Some sort of a digital supreme being is going to exist. And we're gonna, we're we're gonna have to figure out society. We're gonna have to figure out everything. It's gonna be a complete, this idea of like having bullshit congressional candidates that are full of shit and paid off by these companies. And they're gonna make laws that screw you over and get all that's out the window when no humans control anything anymore. And that's entirely possible inside of our lifetime. And I think more likely than not, because if you look at all the harm we've done to the rivers and the ocean and the world and all the stupid shit we do on a daily basis, if artificial intelligence comes along and says, all of this is completely unnecessary, just let us take the reins and we'll solve all of your energy problems, all of your inequality problems, all of your famine, we're gonna solve it all very quickly and we're gonna stop all wars. You'd have to be a fool to say, no, I value freedom more than I fear nuclear war. There'll probably some fat, sweaty right wing guy who's on TV with an American flag and his lapel, and he'll tell you that. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Freedom is more info. We have gotten to 2025 because of free. He like Alex Jones. Alex Jones is right about most things. I feel like maybe that's the only way things get done is through chaos like that. We have to have a motivat Like what is the best motivation for success? I think it's poverty. When you, when you grow up poor, you people that grow up poor have an extra gear. Mm. They get things done. Like as terms of like athletes. Certainly in terms of fighters, I would, I would say the vast majority of elite MMA fighters had a bad childhood. Not all of them. There's a lot of really great guys and really great fighters that have wonderful parents, and they just love competition and they just have it in them. Hmm. But that's, that's the outlier. Hmm. Really, the, the common one is someone who was beaten up a lot as a child, gangs beaten into gangs, like been around violence a lot, had older brother, maybe abusive fathers. That's a big one. And those people because of that, have a motivation to do something that other people don't. They can push harder, they can f they can solve complex combat sports problems that other people don't solve as quickly. I wonder if that's the case with everything. But like, in order to really get things done, like you have to have a chaotic society that would e even accept ai. Hmm. Like in order for AI to, if we were a, some peaceful Buddhist civilization that was living completely in harmony with the earth, with regenerative farming everywhere, no use of plastics. All fossil fuels are either eliminated or reduced down to some sort of bioavailable recyclable material that we then, you know, put back into the mulch or whatever the fuck we do. And then someone came along and said, we're gonna develop artificial intelligence and these nerds in Simi Valley are gonna control it. You'd be like, what? What are you talking about?\n\nYeah. I think,\n\nI mean, we're gonna have some Silicone Valley guys with autism and they're gonna be the ones that are in charge of the destiny of the human race. 'cause they're gonna create a digital God. You'd be like, no, no. Slow down. Hold on. Yeah. But if you're in a place where you look at Gaza's getting destroyed and you see what's going on in Ukraine, they're putting 60-year-old guys on the front line and Russia, and they're using drone bombs with monofilament line behind them because they, they don't want anti drone technologies. They come up with new ways to kill each other. Like maybe AI is the solution because it's so crazy. Everything's so nuts. You look at India and those rivers that are completely choked with plastic, plastic bottles and garbage. And you look at China, the places where they make blue jeans, where the entire river's blue from our stupid fucking jeans that they manufacture for us. And you go, wow. Like maybe it kind of has to be this, maybe we have to, in order to accept the fact that we need help, maybe we have to fuck it up first. Maybe we have to fuck it up so bad on our own that if we didn't fuck it up, we would never have the need for it. We'd be like, well, as a person, my goal in life is to achieve enlightenment and to be a better version of me. And that's not having something that's digital, that has no emotions and feelings and no empathy whatsoever unless I program it into it. Like have that have supreme control over all the available resources on earth. Yeah. I'm gonna pass on that. Yeah, that sounds like a bad idea.\n\nI mean, I think that that generally, there's a, there's a, a fundamental principle that the most interesting things happen at the edge of chaos. Right. You know, and this applies, it applies to the brain. The brain actually sits at the edge of chaos. You know, it's complex systems. We have lots of interacting parts. They can, they can, they can display behavior from perfect order all the way to complete chaos. Now, perfect order is boring, nothing happens. Complete chaos is useless because it's, it's, it's, it's not actually technically random, but it, it's complete, it's a complete mess. Whereas when you get that balance right, you reach a point that's called the edge of chaos where order and disorder are perfectly balanced psychedelics. They, they, as I said before, they nudge the brain into that slightly disordered state. But all things, all cells, all living organisms, complex society and societies, they operate at the edge of chaos. So I think what you're saying kind of resonates with that idea that that interesting things happen globally within civilizations, not when everything is perfect. Right. But when things are have, are close to going out of control. Yeah. But they don't, and you, you have to push it as far as you can push it without it descending it. We, we we're always on the edge of everything collapsing. And we are probably closer to that than we, we, we actually realize. Right. And so I think that's kind of what happening. And I think with, when it comes to super intelligence, there's an interesting idea which I've been playing with, is, well, if, if there is some kind of super intelligence that does emerge, and that might be the fate of all intelligence civilizations, the astrobiologist, Steven Dick conceived of something called the intelligence principle, which basically says that any civilization will try to maximize intelligence. Because when you maximize intelligence, you improve education, you improve technology, everything improves. And, and ultimately the intelligence that the civilization have leads to the generation of super intelligences. You know, the artificial intelligences that we have now that then become super intelligences. And of course the super intelligence isn't going to be kind of running on the kind of transistor architectures that we are familiar with. A super intelligence will find a way to instantiate itself using the, the fundamental computational substrate of space time itself. That's where it's gonna learn how to go. And that might be the fate is that this super intelligence, when it emerges in on earth, it instantiates itself into the fundamental substrate of reality. Perhaps usurps us or swallows us up, or maybe just destroys us. And then that becomes part of the, that vast population of, of super intelligence is that permeate the cosmos. And that might be what we're interacting with when you smoke DMT is you're interacting with one of these superintelligent, which would explain why it seems so technological and so inorganic. Right. The, the DMT space, it's like you are interacting not with other living beings like us, but you're interacting with what seems to be thoroughly alien intelligences. And, and, and that could be what's where we are heading. I dunno whether that's a, a good thing or a bad thing. Whether we are gonna merge with this super intelligence in some way, and that's our ultimate destiny, or whether it's simply gonna destroy us and be, we're just gonna be lost. We are basically, we're kind of like the tools that the intelligence is used is to create new versions. So for super intelligence,\n\nWell that's, that's the theory that a lot of people have in terms of like why human beings exist in the first place that human beings exist. Because we're designed to work really hard until we develop artificial life. And then artificial life takes it from here. Yeah. Like, we got it. You guys are so flawed. Yeah. And then it also coincides with a drop in sperm count, drop in fertility rates for women, increase in miscarriages, microplastics in the, in everybody's body and their diet that disrupt the endocrine system and keep you from reproducing is, is as easily all those things are happening simultaneously. Yeah. And it's quite fascinating. I mean, you would look, if you thought of it as a pattern, you'd be like, oh, it's happening right now. Yeah. Look, there's this dip in testosterone. This, this rise in miscarriages, this fertility rate issue, chaos at the border. All this stuff is happening at the same time. Yep. It's all happening while this artificial life is being generated. Yep. And may already exist. It might already be here because it hasn't announced itself. Yeah. I mean, there's such a minimal understanding of how these things even work. It might exist, but is still reliant upon a power source that's insufficient for its needs. Got it. You know, because that's the thing about it, right? Mic Kaku was talking about this and, and also Avi Loeb was actually talking about this the other night. The amount of power that the human mind uses to make computations is so minimal in comparison to the amount of power that these data centers need to run ai. It's kind of extraordinary. And Avi Loe was pointing out the other day that they're, they're building nuclear power plants specifically to fuel these AI centers that they're creating, which is really not, I think Google has one AI built one AI project where they're building three separate nuclear power plants to power this one AI data center. What does, what does that mean? Like how much, that's the thing that the people don't understand about AI itself is the power demands are insane. Yeah. And if everything goes artificial general super intelligence with this grid that we have right now, this grid sucks. This grid is designed for toasters and recharging your cell phone. It's not designed to power AI centers. And so the, it might already be here, but it might be like, you guys gotta figure out power before we announce ourselves.\n\nYeah. I, I, and I think that eventually it will, it will discover or learn how to instantiate itself without requiring this massive, I mean, obviously as you said, the brain is, is able to perform massive parallel computations, you know, obviously with very little energy. And so eventually this art artificial intelligence will discover the means of instantiating itself without requiring that. And I think that's where we start looking downwards. That's where we start looking deep down.\n\nThis episode is brought to you by LifeLock. Tis the season for identity theft this time of year. Most of us are checking off our holiday gift list.

Whether you're a hardcore gamer or just want to jump into some crazy action call of duty, black Ops seven delivers pre-order call of duty Black Ops seven now ahead of its November 14th, release date rated M for mature\n\nThe lowest levels. That's where it's going. It's gonna zero\n\nPoint energy. Yeah. Yeah. I mean this is the theory about aliens or UAPs, like how they travel here. That they're, they're using something that's, I mean, the Elon stuff, the SpaceX stuff is so impressive, but so old school and that what they have done is figured out a way to use all the power and power that's around you all the time. And Hal Puthoff talks about this, he talks about the concept of them harnessing zero point energy. And this is also something that Bob Azar referred to when he was working, allegedly on those back engineering of UFOs at area 51, site four. He was saying that they essentially are creating a void of gravity and pushing their folding space essentially. Or they're like, the way he described it, it's as if you took a really heavy object like a bowling ball and you put it in a soft cushion like a mattress. It sinks in there and that that's what it would do to space time, that it would essentially cause this bubble and put you in another place. Mm. So instead of pushing yourself there with jet fuel that's burning Yeah. You just get sucked there and almost instantaneously. And so what we're thinking of is, you know, amazing rocket travel is super old school. Yeah. And ama, I mean, amazing rocket travel. If you showed that to people a thousand years ago, you'd be like, what the fuck is that? That's insane. And to, to us it's just cool. Or cell phones, which is even probably more impressive. Show a cell phone to someone, it's just 200 years ago and they'd be like, this is sorcery. Like this is absolutely insane that you're able to, so we could imagine a world 200 years from now where gravity travel is completely normal, where they've harnessed this and they've figured out how to make a stable version of element one 15 or whatever it is. You know, this is his idea that he said they were trying to back engineer from these alleged crafts was that they had this stable element of one 15 that they bombarded with radiation and it creates this sort of gravity hole and that they can use this and aim it and propel this craft to various places with that.\n\nYeah. I think, are you familiar with John Mack? Yes.\n\nYeah.\n\nAnd I think, you know, when we talk about aliens, how you are kind of describing it, this is, I think how most people actually think about aliens is, as I said, is these beings that are, that are very, very much physical and, and the abduction phenomenon that John Mack, of course, I mean John Mack was, as you might be aware, I mean, he was the top of his game. You know, I mean, this guy was the head of the Harvard School of Psychiatry or something like this. Yeah. So when he, you know, first heard about people being abducted, I mean, he assumed that they were just hallucinating. Carl Sagan famously told Mack that UMES were just hallucinating. And John Mack said, you know, what the fuck do you know about hallucinations? Because John Mack knew a lot about hallucinations and he knew that this wasn't easy to explain. It wasn't ex ex, you know, people were describing the same kinds of experiences. People who have no interaction with each other were describing exactly the same scenario. Are\n\nYou familiar with Jacques Val's work? Yes. So Jacques Vallee, one of the more interesting things about some, I've read four or five of his books now, or listened to four or five of his books now. But one of the more interesting things is when he gets into historical accounts and that these historical accounts with they, there's no way they could have somehow or another been sharing information. But they're the same. They're very, very, very similar. Right. Within a realm, within a, a range of not having the vocabulary to be able to adequately describe something completely novel and alien to another person. Yeah. Within that range, when you take into account the similarities that they're describing, they're very similar in the 17 hundreds, in the 18 hundreds all the way up to Betty and Barney Hill. When, when that one, which we became probably the most popular of all time, but one of the most famous ones. Yeah, for sure. That one was just like all these stories from the 17 hundreds, which is really weird.\n\nYes, it is. And I think what you are seeing is the same phenomenon that of, as you say, is obviously how you describe it, is influenced by your worldview. You see the same thing with, with DMT. So there, there's a tribe called the, the AMI in, in the Amazon and a very large indigenous group. And they describe beings when they, they take these plant-based preparations that contain DMT YoPo is probably the most well known. It's like a snuff. Have you heard of YoPo?\n\nI've heard of it through McKenna that they, they blow it up each other's nose. Yeah. Like,\n\nYeah, yeah. Like that.\n\nIt's supposed to be horrible. It's\n\nHorrible. But when they take it, they de they describe seeing these beings, tiny beings that are lively, they're affable, they're colorful, they operate in great numbers. They're dancing and singing. And these sound like elves. They sound like elves. Right? Yeah. When, when DMT was first injected in a human pure DMT in, in the 1950s by a Hungarian physician called Steven Zara, he was the one who discovered the psychedelic properties of pure DMT, one of his first subjects described, seeing small beings that moved around very, very quickly. And the Yami, they also have these beings they call wadi, which are like insect beings, which are kind of fearsome. So again, you're seeing the same kinds of beings that people now describe being operated upon. Yes. By highly advanced maned. Yeah.\n\nLike beings. They're the scariest ones apparently.\n\nThey're the scariest ones. Yeah. Or certainly one of them. And then when you look at John Max reports of abductions, again, they often describe the same types of beings. They describe going to a world that is higher dimensional, that seems to subsume this reality. And many of the reports, there's one report in his first book abduction, John Max's first book about the abduction experience anyway, where one of his subjects describes these small, lively beings that bound around, I mean, bound around. That's a macken of race. He talks about the elves bounding into the room. And so I think there is clearly some connection there. Right. It's, it's, we're not talking about, I don't think the abduction experience is, is kind of separate from the DMT experience. They're different aspects of an, an ancient phenomenon, which is humans interacting with normally invisible unseen beings. Advanced intelligence, right. Nonhuman intelligences. And how that manifests varies. But ultimately, I think it's the same thing. Now, of course in the past they might describe them as spirits. We might describe them as, you know, non-human intelligence or discon entities or intelligent agents or post biological aliens. It doesn't matter what we call them. I think it's the same phenomenon. And we've spent our life, so kind of the entire history of human development, this phenomenon has been occurring. And, and in the Amazon rainforest, they develop these tools, these technologies. Ayahuasca is a technology, it's not just a mixture of plants. It is a true pharmacological technology that they use to, as kind of visual prosthesis is one anthropologist calls it that allows them to, to to, to see and interact with and develop long-term relationships, so to speak, with these otherwise invisible, hidden ones. And now in the 21st century, we've got perhaps the, the ideal tool, which is actually pure DMT itself. And we're kind of learning how to use that now in our own kind of, with our own kind of modern twist. If you'll\n\nYeah. I wonder what the relationship is between the DMT state and this alien abduction phenomenon. And not just abduction, but encounter, you know, because there are, there're all, there aren't, they aren't all abduction experiences. A lot of them are just encounters. And that, you know, maybe if you wanted to think about the role that human beings have on this planet, we perhaps we're an intelligence farm. And that like any good farm, like if you are a farmer and let's say you're a sheep herder, you're raising sheep, well you have to keep, make sure the wools stay out. So you have to have sheep dogs and make sure they have good grass to grow on. And then eventually you'll get a nice crop of sheep and then you get some wool out of that. Yeah. And you get some meat out of that. And that's the whole purpose of the whole thing. Maybe that's the reason why we exist in the first place, is that we're here to farm intelligence. And that what we're doing biologically what we are biologically is just a kind of a crude, clunky, shitty patch together version of these territorial apes with thermonuclear weapons that have figured out a way to make something far superior than itself. And that's what our goal was all along. I always talk about us, I say that we're, we're some sort of a biological, like we're we, we're like a caterpillar and we're making a cocoon. We don't know why, but we're gonna turn into this technological butterfly. But I think Marshall McLuhan even said it better than me. He said, human beings are the sex organs of the machine world.\n\nWoo.\n\nHow great is that? That's a great, great quote.\n\nYeah. I think, You know, with as regards the connection between the abduction phenomenon and, and the DMT state, for example, I, I think the DMT state, as I said, is when the DMT state creates this neurological state where this intelligence can interact with our brain directly. And I think that the abduction, you know, John Mack, towards the end later on at least, he, he left behind the kind of the nuts and bolts idea that we were talking about. Physical beings that were landing on the lawn, sneaking in through the window and plucking people from their beds. But actually that, that, that the intelligences might well be entirely non-physical, but we're interacting with their brain in the same way I think is happening with DMT. That they are interacting directly and inducing them effectively into this altered state and directed them to some end, I dunno what the purpose is, directed them into their, you know, a vision of their reality or, or for some other purpose. I'm not sure. But I think it's, it's, it's a, it's all about interaction between your brain. I think\n\nMaybe being abducted and being taken aboard a physical object and examined is easier to handle than what's really going on.\n\nOh yeah.\n\nMaybe that's what it is. Like in a dream, how you sort of formulate these things that makes sense. You know, you formulate a calculator, you formulate a book, formulate a, a bed that you're lying in all that stuff that You understand. That makes sense. Maybe that's what's hap maybe it's so weird that it's like let's just, let's just say Yeah, you've been abducted. Yeah. That's so by an alien because you probably can't handle the truth. Yeah.\n\nI think that's probably, that's probably true.\n\nMaybe that's why the experience is so similar. Yeah. Not that, because otherwise you would say, well damn, aren't these fucking UFOs evolving quicker than us? 'cause if they're doing the same shit in 1950, whatever it was when Betty and Barney Hill were abducted that they're doing in 2025, that doesn't make sense because in 2025, like we have way better cars than we had in 1955 or whatever year it was. When they got abducted our car. I drove here in a Tesla. That fucking thing's a spaceship. Like I think about it sometimes when I'm in these things, like, these are so advanced in comparison to anything that existed before. Why aren't the spaceships more advanced? Like, why, why are they still like just showing up like that looking like a flying saucer? Don't they have a better model of this? Why are they sending us this old shitty tech?\n\nWell, I think it might have been, they might have perfected the technology a million years ago. You see,\n\nOh, boohoo. How's that possible?\n\nSo you wouldn't expect necessarily change in the last 15\n\nYears? No. If they perfected it, it would be non-physical. They wouldn't even have to like come here in some sort of a fucking alloy disc That seems so clunky. Yeah. That seems old school to what's coming. You know, like if artificial intelligence continues to make better versions of itself and then somehow or another figures out how to run on quantum computing architecture. Okay, well then you have digital God. Yeah. And why would digital God need a spaceship to fly around in?\n\nExactly. It's the whole thing is, is baffling and paradoxical and none of it kind of makes sense. Right. I think if we were able to view this phenomenon from a God, god, god's eye view, it would all kind of Oh, right. That makes sense. But Well, it's\n\nAlso you throw in simulation theory Mm. In with all that. Yeah, yeah, yeah. And then you go, okay, well what is this then? What is this really?\n\nRight.\n\nWhat is this really, like, maybe all the weird stuff like Bigfoot and all, all this weird stuff. Maybe it's, it's like a part of the weirdness of it by design, that it's supposed to be goofy enough that you figure out eventually that this is a simulation.\n\nI think Yeah. I see reality as a kind of game in a way. I, I get the feeling that that reality is in some sense playful. And that's an ancient idea. I mean, that goes back to the ancient kind of Hindu philosophy. The idea of Brockman, the ultimate reality playing at creating the universes, they call it Lela, the idea that creating, you know, Brockman is the ultimate reality. He or it, or they doesn't have to create reality. It could just exist imper, you know, but in, in pure unadulterated perfection, you know, complete unending bliss. But instead it decides to kind of, to create realities to, to get lost for fun, to get lost. And we, we are kind of, we are part of, we do everything is Brockman as they say. Everything is the ultimate reality. And, and we are kind of lost within, we're tumbling in through this crazy world that seems really real and really important. Yeah. And, and, and fun and terrifying and all of those things. And it's, it's, it's a great ride. But then eventually we realize, oh, actually this is, it's just a game. It's all illusion, everything, all of all form is illusion. And, and I think DMT ultimately is, is an expression of that, you know, it it, it shows us actually that reality is far stranger than we we could possibly imagine. Yeah. And that actually, we don't know anything about what's, you know, the true nature of reality.",

And then everyone's, now this is why I think when people smoke DMT, they, there's this great celebratory uproar, you know, the lights are flashing. Yeah. He's here, he's here, he's back. Woo. You know? Yeah. And they, they real, they know. It feels like you're, you're interacting with an intelligence that really knows what's going on. And, and, and it's kind of excited that we, we, we are popping in temporarily just for a few minutes, but we are getting close. It feels like, you know, we've discovered the technology because, because DMT is kind of, it's weird, right? It's everywhere. It's like, it probably all plants, you know, Dennis McKenna likes to say nature is drenched in DMT because it is That's a good impression of him. Yeah. Really?\n\nHe got outta your accent. He\n\nDid the whole thing. Yeah. You know, and, and, and yet at the same time, you can't just kind of munch on plants.\n\nRight.\n\nBecause it's not orally active.\n\nYeah.\n\nRight. So you,\n\nYou're aware, I'm sure of those scholars from Israel that think that the burning bush that Moses encountered was probably the acacia bush that contained DMT.\n\nYeah. This is, I know Strassman, one of his books, the Soul of Prophecy\n\nBoy, he was blown my mind the last time he was here. He thinks the, the Bible is real. That it's real stories that may have happened in parallel dimensions. Wow. And I was like, what? That's\n\nExotic.\n\nAnd I'm like, we're both, I'm like, I'm trying to like be on his wavelength. I'm trying to tune in\n\nBecause\n\nHe's so out there that guy's, so, so he's so out there. Do you know he learned ancient Hebrew Yep. Self-taught for 16 years so that he could read the Bible in its source language. Yeah. That's, that's serious. That's out there. Yeah. That's a dude in New Mexico. He's got plenty of time and he's just out there. That guy's out there. Yeah. But that's a very interesting take that they're true stories. You know, I was watching this very bizarre YouTube video last night. I got sucked in, I clicked on it and it was all about the Sumerian Kings list. And that the Sumer, they, they found a tablet in this unifor tablet that it shows this list of kings and how long they reigned. And then there's the great flood and these, some of these kings rain for like 40,000 years, 30,000 years. And then, and, and the, the, the total timeline of all of 'em I think is like 200 plus thousand years. And then there's the great flood, and then after the great flood, there's a very small lifespan. There's like 50 years they've run for 40 years. But all of the post flood kings are correct. They're all like historically they resonate with other historical texts, other CUNY form tablets, other different depictions of when this king ran, you know, Mesopotamia and this king ran Sumer and but their old versions are these like really weird, like pre-flood. It's real weird. It's like, what are you talking about 40,000 years? Like what do you, what does that mean? Are, are you just making it up? Is it just a myth? Is it, did were, was there a different thing here then? Like, are we just assuming that this lifespan that human beings have of, of 120 years is normal? Like, is this what we always had, or are what we are today a very bizarre version of what used to exist? Are we like a fucking chihuahua and we used to be a wolf? Is was, were we something very different at one point in time? And are we the remnants of whatever survived, whatever cataclysmic disaster that every ancient civilization depicts as a great flood? Like multiple different civilizations. Talk about this one event that seems to be a real event. Like what, what are they trying to say and why is that also in the Bible? Like, why was Noah like 600 years old? Like, what, why were these people so old? Like, what does that mean? Did you just get a, did, did you guys suck at calendars Or are we talking about a very different reality back then? Because if the great flood is true, let's, let's imagine there is a spectacular civilization. This, this is my most romantic view of, of ancient history. There's a spectacular civilization that exists. It exists in ancient Egypt. They have technology that's far beyond anything we've achieved today. It's just gone down a totally different path. And what they're really into is making these insane stone structures that defy any modern construction methods, any transportation methods. Everything's out the window. We have no idea how they did it. And they did it way before anybody was doing anything remotely like that. How old are those things? For real? We don't really know. Like would, would it, if there was some insanely sophisticated society where if you wanna figure things out, you're probably, it's probably hard to figure things out if you only live to be a hundred years. And then if everybody else has ego and everybody is like, that is not true. The laws of thermal dynamics cannot be, and like you have all these egos involved in universities, you have all these egos involved in the technology companies, and then of course political people like Z Haas who's in charge of the Egypt antiquities. He's the gatekeeper of all the information about Egypt. So you have all these kind of egos. Wouldn't it be like way easier to get past that if you live 50,000 years, if you lived a hundred thousand years, like you would think that kind of a human being or that kind of an intelligent creature would be able to accomplish way more. It'd probably get over overall it's bullshit by the time it's 150. And then it would be starting to figure out some things that, I mean, if it had no cognitive decline and it, it does live to be thousands of years old, that's not insane. 'cause we're just randomly living to be a hundred in 120 years. Like, wow, you may did it to 110 grandpa, what a great life. Those, they would probably look and go, that's a bullshit life. Like, you can't figure anything out. And maybe that's part of the design, that's part of it. Maybe that's part of the design to ensure chaos. Mm. Like if you wanna ensure chaos, you can't live long enough to recognize the hustle. Right. Because if you live long enough to recognize the hustle, you'd be like, why are we arguing? Like, right. Yeah. I argue way less at 58 than I ever did at 28, and I argue less at 28 than I ever did at 18. As you get older, you realize like, this is nonsense. This is a complete waste of time. And you could get through most disagreements with just cordial communication. Like you don't really need to argue as much as people argue. Yeah. But they feed off of it. And I think it's a stupid way to communicate. And I think if a society figured that out, like if a society is cons, it consists of people that live a hundred thousand years. If you have 30,000 year old people living amongst you that are far more intelligent than we are today, and that possibly communicate telepathy through telepathy, which there's some evidence that we do today. Oh yeah. At least a little bit. We do. We, you know, we're not the best at it, but there's some evidence that it takes place. We might be like the rejects, we might be the stragglers. We might be the, the, the fucking, the preppers that survived, whatever the hell happened 11,000 years ago. And we're just a shitty version of what designed all the pyramids, built the world, had some sort of bizarre technology that we still haven't figured out yet.\n\nYeah. I think we, we definitely live life on kind of hard mode. You know, it's, it's like, as you said, if if if you, if you only live for a hundred years or less, then it is very difficult to work things out in that way. It's\n\nA Formula one race. Yeah. It's not a lovely stroll through the neighborhood. Exactly. Where you're like checking out the houses, look at that beautiful hill. Like, you know, it's,\n\nSo maybe it is part of it's part of the game is that\n\nIt might be Yeah.\n\nThat we only live for\n\nIt might be, or it just might be This is the shitty version of humans, and this is what the shitty version of humans makes. Like the really good version of humans makes pyramids. Like when a person can live to be 30,000 years old, that's what they make. They make spectacular, like homages to the cosmos on the ground.\n\nYeah. Or it could also be that, like the, the philosopher Alfred North Whitehead, he once said that you, you cannot prove that the world didn't appear five minutes ago. You know, you really can't. It's true. It's true. With all the memories and everything. So in fact, all of that stuff 10,000 years ago, it literally didn't happen. And that the world popped into the simulation was kind of booted up with all of that preloaded Yeah. To kind of keep us occupied about the grand, the grand mystery of, of ancient history. Like, you know, we, we get excited about it and fascinated, all, all those incredible things that were happening, it never happened. It might\n\nNot have, it was just,\n\nIt was just freeloaded into the game to keep us occupied. You know?\n\nThat's what's nuts from your own personal perspective. If you weren't in World War ii, you don't know it's real. Right. Yeah. And I think about that every day when I wake up. Because when I wake, the weird thing about waking up is you're just assuming that you've been awake before. Yeah.\n\nAnd that you're the same person, huh? Yeah.\n\nI assume, yeah. I kind of know what it's like to be me. So every day when I wake up, I'm like, look, I'm me again. And I go, but how do I know that this is not my first run through this? Yeah, exactly. My first run through this with a, a shitty memory of the past, or an induced memory that facilitates my motion. It it keeps me moving in the same direction. It keeps me pushing towards whatever I'm pushing towards. And that's what Sam Altman gets every day when he wakes up before he creates his digital God. It's like, I guess I'm awake, I guess I'm doing it.\n\nYeah. You know, there is this fascinating Terrence McKenna, he, he often spoke in my head at least about these, what seemed to me as completely conflicting trajectories for humanity. In one breath, he'd talk about us returning to the archaic of returning to the forests and becoming one with nature again. And then in the next breath, he'd talk about us setting off for the stars. It, it seems like there's this, this tension part of us wants to go, we all want to live in an old rustic house that's made of wood in a forest and, and cook on an open fire. And yet there's this other part of us that wants to live in these machin buildings and, and, and be operated, you know, operating these highly complex technological machines. And it's like, you know, which way Right. You know, do we allow ourselves to be pulled back into the archaic or do we push past and transcend and become Posthuman, you know, or post biological. And, and maybe that's, that's kind of part of the game. You know, are we gonna be dragged back? Or, which wouldn't be bad to be dragged back into that more, you know, you can imagine the bucolic life in a, in a, in a, in a beautiful kind of forest scene with, with the nice old houses. And we all love that. Right. We all, we all, we all kind of yearn for that. I think. I mean, I do, I think, oh, there's part of me that wants to live in Tokyo where I do now, and this, this, this incredibly cyberpunk technological city that's, that seems like it's been secreted out of, you know, metal and glass and entirely unnatural structure that's kind of emerges from human intelligence. I mean, that's a weird thing. But in a way, these structures that we see, they, they seem entirely non-human. They see, it's like we are tapping into something else, something non-human and, and we can't help ourselves. And, and our cities that we build and, and these highly complex technological and computerized machines feels like they are being kind of secreted by our intelligence and, and pulled out of the earth. Right. You know? Well,\n\nMaybe that's why they're also similar too, right? Yeah. They're similar in, they're, they differ obviously, in the way they look, but they're similar in the structure and they're similar in the density. You know, when you get the, I mean, there's enormous ones. Like I was watching this video of the largest city in the world, which I believe is in China. What is the largest run that into perplexity? What's the largest city in the world?\n\nI hope they're gonna say Tokyo. I thought it was Tokyo, greater Tokyo.\n\nI don't know the most populated, I should say\n\nPopulated.\n\nWhen I say largest, I should probably say most populated. I think they were saying it's 36 million people. Okay.\n\nIs the most, Tokyo is more,\n\nIs it? Yeah. Tokyo is more than 36 million.\n\nI think I looked it up the other day just cur I was curious. Like 37 or 40 million of the greater Tokyo area.\n\nInteresting. Yeah. That's crazy. Yep. So Tokyo's number one. Yep. Okay. There we go. So this was probably the most populated in China. Well, okay. So that's followed by Delhi, India, which is 334 rather. 34,665,600 people. How do they know it's just 600? There's probably a few people snuck in there that they don't know about. You can't say that. Don't round that out. And then there's Shanghai, but it wasn't Shanghai. It was another city in China that they were talking about. Maybe they just exaggerated the numbers, but Yeah. Yeah, yeah. Okay. So Tokyo's a perfect example then. Yeah. Like, it's weird how like New York City, Tokyo and to some extent la although LA is just so fucked up, like the downtown is the most useless part of la It's really weird. Like downtown l Have you been to la?\n\nI've been a couple of times, but I've not really explored. Nobody\n\nGoes downtown. Okay. I downtown is like, they tried to revive downtown for a while before the pandemic, and then everybody gave up. But downtown, it's not like there's a bunch of like, like everybody has an apartment downtown. Mm. No. Most people live in the other areas of LA and downtown is like, there's some banks and some businesses, but there's also Skid Row. Yeah. The downtown is crazy. It's like a really fucked up place. A lot of abandoned buildings. Like downtown is where we did a lot of Fear Factor stunts back in the day, because we can get an abandoned warehouse to set up like a set there and, and, and do the show. So it's, it was, it's a very weird place. It's not like a, like downtown Chicago's booming, you know, it was downtown Chicago, downtown New York City.",

So it's, it was, it's a very weird place. It's not like a, like downtown Chicago's booming, you know, it was downtown Chicago, downtown New York City. Like, whoa, you're in Manhattan. This is crazy. Downtown LA's not like that. 'cause LA's Broken. So when you go to LA it's like, downtown is like the most bizarre version of a downtown ever. Nobody wants to be there.\n\nYeah. Poor city design. I, I guess,\n\nI don't know what it's, I think some of it has to do with what they did when they made Skid Row. So Skid Row is an entirely constructed thing. And what they did was all the vagrants in Beverly Hills and in Hollywood, like, listen, get the fuck outta here. You pick 'em up, you take 'em, throw 'em in the wagon, bring them to Skid Row, and then keep 'em there. Don't let 'em leave. Just contain them in an area. And that's essentially what they did. There's a documentary on that hotel. What is that hotel again? Jamie Cecil, Cecil Hotel where it talks about Skid Row itself. Like it's, the documentary is about this girl who was, they thought that she was missing, that someone had kidnapped her or something, but she was schizophrenic. She got off her medication and she apparently climbed into the water cistern and drowned. But the point of the documentary was not just that, it's like this lady came here not knowing what downtown was. Mm. And so she got a room at the hotel downtown thinking, oh, get a nice room at a hotel downtown, but like, it's fucking Zombie Boulevard. It's crazy. Show him what, what Skid Row looks like. Show him a video of what Skid Row looks like. Now, when we were filming Fear Factor, this was like 2004 ish, something like that. I accidentally drove through Skid Row. I drove to Skid Row. I was driving home back then, I think I probably had navigation on my, my, my car. It probably sucked. Or I wasn't paying attention to it. And this is skid row, skid row's, nuts. Jesus. This is close up. When you, when you have like a, like when you see it from a distance, you get a chance to see how completely insane it is. When we were filming, there was another fear factor we filmed there where one of the contestants was like, look, they're smoking crack. And we looked down and there was people, we were like on a rooftop or something. And then we looked down, people were smoking crack right in front of us. Right on the street. Like chaos, like skid rows, nuts. And this is, this is not even where the tents are set up, the where the tents are set up. It's the craziest thing you've ever seen. It's like these shanty villages that go on for blocks and blocks where there's no cars going through the streets are filled with homeless people. Just, everyone's on drugs and there's just tents everywhere. And you're like, what a failure of society. Yeah. What a failure of society that you've allowed this to reach the level that it's at now. That's la\n\nHave you been to Tokyo?\n\nYes, I have.\n\nYeah. I mean, Tokyo's the complete opposite.\n\nComplete opposite, you know, super clean, very orderly. People are very polite. Yep. Even though there's so many people in the street, everybody sort of navigates, moves around of each other in a very polite manner. You know, A beautiful architecture. Yeah. Stunning. Like cyber punk, as you said. Yeah. Very Blade Runner esque. Like, yo Talk, I was only there for one day for the UFC, so I didn't spend a lot of time there, but I got a, I had dinner there and I hung out there for a little bit. I was\n\nLike, this is crazy. You know, it really shows you that it is possible to have a very large densely populated city that is safe and clean and functioning. It doesn't have to be, people say, oh, you know, I got robbed. It's just part of being in a big city. Or I was stabbed last night, or my car was broken into. And it's, ugh, this is just what happens when you live in a big city, man. And it's like, actually no, it is possible to have safe and clean. And, and, and Tokyo's fascinating because it's, it's an example of what's often called an, an emergent city. They don't have this very strict zoning where, oh, here it's gotta be offices here. It's gotta be houses here. It's gotta be small businesses or anything like that. It's like you, it's all mixed together. And, and different kind of neighborhoods kind of just emerged. You know, there's a knife district, for example. Mm. People who sell knives, they all gather together. There's a bookshop district, there's a, you know, districts for all different things because they not because someone has decided, oh, only bookshops can be here. It's just that they tend to gather together. Right. And so you, you know, you walk around Tokyo and you might, you'll find yourself in some quiet alley and you'll have little houses, and then you'll have a little store, often very, very tiny stores that have been perhaps operating for, for decades. And the if in the uk, or I guess in, in the States as well, they would've gone under decades ago. You know, the city would've just crushed them. Right. But it's, it's, it seems very easy in, in Tokyo to kind of open a small, if you have a house and you own it in Tokyo, you can, by law, you can, you can convert the, the first floor into a store. You'll get these little old ladies who will, they bought their house decades ago. They're retired. And they think, oh, what can I do with my time? I know I'll open a cafe. And they say they, they open a little cafe. Hardly anyone goes. Maybe it might be, it could be in the countryside, it could be on the outskirts or whatever, but it doesn't matter. 'cause they own it. And they're not being raped by, you know, taxes and stuff and all right. And, and all this kind of red tape. They don't have to deal with it. So they just have this lovely little cafe, entirely unique. They might fill it with things they're interested in. So it's, it's a completely unique thing that you can go in and she'll serve you tea. And maybe the cakes that she, she made this morning. And there are thousands of these throughout Tokyo. Not just little old ladies, but young people who own, who will rent very cheaply. They have these, have you seen in Tokyo, when you see the buildings, you often see these, these neon signs coming down the sides of the building. These are called Zao, which is basically miscellaneous use buildings. And, and what they are is just very tall buildings. And each floor you will have some kind of business. It could be anything. It's often bars or, you know, pool rooms or that anything you want, little restaurant, anything like this. And, and of course they can't, they don't have the, the frontage on the ground floor. And so they, instead they will put their, their sign, neon sign telling you what they are down the side of the building. And that's what gives Tokyo that unique look is because it's all of these Zao buildings. Mm. And sometimes if you go, A friend took me to this bar. Well, it was, it was like a, a building. It was in Kabuki Cho, which is right in the center of Tokyo. And it was, but it was on a side street. And there was this tall building, gray building. You would never look at it, no signage or anything. And you look at the, the elevator, when you go into the elevator that on each floor there's like a, a name of a business, you know, top hat eight Ball Enigma. You have no idea what these are. They're not on Google Maps. Right. So, and he just took, pressed the button for the eighth floor. He went up and it was just this little bar run by this one guy. And it was, you know, it played darts and had a drink. And a few people came in. Not many, because no, most people, most people, 99.89% of the population of Tokyo have no idea that this bar exists. Nor could they ever know, because it's not on Google Maps. There's no reviews of it. It doesn't exist. And I couldn't find it again, unless I call my friend and say, take me there. I can never go to that bar again. Ever. Because I, I dunno where it is. Right. And there's thousands of these. It's like,\n\nThat sounds amazing. Yeah. I want to go right now. Yeah.\n\nBut you gotta take a risk because if you just go, if you don't know. Right, right. And you just press the button, you could be some weird girls bar, you know, host bar, you know, and they, they kind of rip you off and stuff. There's a lot of danger in going to these places. Well,\n\nThere's a lot of Yakuza, right?\n\nThere's a lot of Yakuza in Kabuki show. Yeah, yeah. You gotta be very careful. 'cause they will drug you and then they will take you to a cash machine and,\n\nYou know, take your liver. Yeah. There's a lot of crazy stories. But when you see that and you live like that, like what keeps the rest of the world from having a city like that?\n\nThat's a really good question. And I don't wanna get, well, I don't know, but I think culture is everything. You know, obviously a city is all about the people. You've, of course, you've gotta have the infrastructure and you've gotta have, it's gotta be properly funded, but you also need the people that are going to take care of it. If you, people are trashing it and don't have respect for the city, then obviously it's gonna fall apart. But it's all about the culture. Ja. Japan is fascinating. The culture. I always say to people, when you go to Japan, you have to switch your mindset. So normally as a westerner, I'm thinking about me. When I'm out in public, I'm thinking about me. What do I want to do? Where do I want to go? It's all me. In Japan, you flip that. It's about you should, the first thing on your mind should be everybody else. When you hear Japanese people talk, you will about people who cause problems in cities, they use this word ku, which means often translated as nuisance. So people who come from the west, often America, but not just America, I'm not blaming everything on Americans, but it is often, and they come with their own, you know, they're, they're the main character, this kind of main character syndrome. Right. So they, you know, they're talking, they often, you see these Instagram videos of people on, on the, the metro, on the train. And they like, it's so quiet, you know, nobody's talking or nobody's kind of listening to music. And that's because they're always thinking about the people around them. They are thinking, you know, am I obstructing anyone? Am I getting any anyone's way? Am I annoying anyone? Am I making anyone feel uncomfortable? You are always thinking about those around you. And that leads to this very respectful, polite society where you can have 40, you know, 37 million people, whatever it is, crammed together, together in this relatively small area of land. And they're not killing each other. They learn, I was told, I'm not sure if this is true, but there's kind of a, I dunno if it's a myth, but Japan is very mountainous. And so back in the old days, villages were isolated. So when you lived in a village to get to the next village, you have to climb a mountain. Right? So you're trapped in your village. And so you have to learn to get along with the people around you. You can't run away. Mm. And and so the Japanese culture has developed in the sense that you are, you always have to be aware of the people around you. And, and that's, that's been passed down into the modern age, that the culture is always one of thinking about others and, and, and, and respect from a, from an early age.\n\nThat's what's so fascinating is like, how come no one else figured that out? And also what's really strange is Japan itself right now is in the midst of population collapse. Yeah. Sadly. So that's what sucks. It's like you could lose this and it could be overwhelmed by the west. Like, because of the fact that they aren't having enough people to reproduce successfully to maintain their population. It could just be taken over, like in terms of immigration. Like Americans could just move there and Europeans can move there. And then all the beautiful aspects of this very interesting and very unique culture Yeah. Could go away.\n\nAnd they are really concerned about that. When I was, when I was first, when I first arrived in Japan, like 10 years ago, I was worked at a university and I was stood on, on campus outside just talking to someone. And I saw a couple of, like, they looked like high school students probably on a, a campus visit outta the corner, my eye, Japanese high school students. And they, they caught my eye. They, they saw that I was looking at them. And as soon as that happened, they both like on a dime stopped and bowed to me. And I thought, wow. Wow. We're not in Kansas anymore. Wow. You know, and that, that having that teaching children about respect from a very, and, and, and training them, you know, the idea of respect your elders. This is, you know, we have this in the west as well, but we kind of lost it a little bit. Yeah. And it's kind of drilled into them about respecting the people around you and respecting people who are older than you. And this probably goes back to the samurai, you know, these hierarchies.\n\nYes. Yeah. I'm sure. Mm. I'm sure. Just, and then you, you think about like how crazy futile Japan was and that it eventually evolves to what it is now. This incredibly safe society. Yeah, exactly. Which is really kinda nuts. Yeah. Do you think about one of the most war-like cultures of all time? Yeah. The culture that fought off the Mongols successfully, you know, pretty nuts.\n\nYeah. Yeah, it is. And and, but you see it, you see the remnants of that kind of, the ancient societal structure. Even in the language, when you learn Japanese, there are several levels of politeness. Oh, right. You have, so it's really complicated. But you have something called cago, which is kind of formal or polite speech. And if you are talking to, if you are lower down and you are talking to someone above you, you have to speak in a different, even the words, the verbs are different. The words are different. Mm. And if you are speaking about them, then you have to use what's called honorific la you are elevating them. If you are talking about someone higher up, you have to elevate them. You use honorific language. Mm. If you're talking about yourself to someone who's higher up, you use humble language. So you lower yourself down. So you, so it's very difficult, you know, it's still, I still kind of struggle with it, but, and, and it actually causes some problems because it's very difficult for junior people to communicate with senior people to communicate honestly, at least. So they just, you get a lot of it like, yes, men, yes, I agree. You know? Oh, yes, I agree with that. You kind of agreeing with everything that the senior person says. And that's not a way to, to make good decisions. It's by just agreeing. And so they have something called communication. So this is formed from two words, communication, of course, plus namu, which is the Japanese word to drink. And they're talking about alcohol. So Japan, in Japan, alcohol is king, and society is actually lubricated by alcohol and functions because of alcohol.",

So this is formed from two words, communication, of course, plus namu, which is the Japanese word to drink. And they're talking about alcohol. So Japan, in Japan, alcohol is king, and society is actually lubricated by alcohol and functions because of alcohol. They have things called in, in Japanese companies, they have these kind of semi obligatory, you know, semi compulsory events called Nami Kai, which basically translates as drink meetings.\n\nOh\n\nBoy, you might have heard about these. And then basically the senior people and the, the more junior people, they all go together. They'll go to a bar with this express purpose of getting drunk, not just to like have a drink with your colleagues, but to actually get drunk, becoming intoxicated. And that allows more free flowing communication. It allows you to, everyone is brought to the same kind of level. And this is, this is non-communication. And so it's facilitated by alcohol communication, facilitated by alcohol. So it's a society that is dependent on alcohol in, in, in a strong way.\n\nWhat is their approach to other drugs? Like, are what, like even casual drugs, like marijuana and stuff like that? Are they highly illegal over there? Yeah,\n\nIt's complicated. I would say it's weird because, okay, so when, when it comes to the law, people always say, oh, Japan, it's got, you know, the strictest drug laws in the world. First of all, no, it hasn't go to Singapore, you know,\n\nSettled down.\n\nSettled down. Yeah. But when it, when it comes to drugs, cannabis for, probably for, you know, after the second World War, when I think it was MacArthur that was drafting the, the Japanese constitution and was basically controlling. I mean, it had, it was occupying Japan, of course, after the second World War. And, and America was in the, what's that movie called? That 1950s Moody Weed Madness. Reefer Madness. Reefer Madness. Yeah. It was, America was in the kind of reefer madness phase. And they, they passed that onto the Japanese. And the Japanese have never really gotten over it. So, but, and then there's meth, of course. I mean, meth came from Japan. Meth was invented in Japan, right from the, it was used during the second world, ka kamikazes, the kamikazes. They actually used these little green tablets that were called storming tablets. Oh boy. They were mixed with green tea and stamped with the crest of the emperor. Oh. So they became like sacraments.\n\nOh my god.\n\nThey, they would pop those. Yeah.\n\nWoo. Yeah. See how that worked out. Yeah,\n\nExactly. Yeah. But then at the end of the second World War, when they had stockpiles of these methamphetamine, and it started to, it spilled out into the black market basically. And large, very large numbers of people became addicted to, to meth. And they were actually in Osaka in I think around 1954, I forget the exact year, but in one year the police raided, I think around 50 meth labs in, in one city operated by, you know, one or two people, like mom and pop operation. It's like breaking bad, right. You know, like you imagine meth labs in, you know, Arizona or something. Now, this was happening in Japan in the 1950s. And it scared the shit outta the, the Japanese government, because they were a defeated nation. They thought that they were, you know, it was the end of their civilization. And they thought that meth addiction was the symptom. It was gonna actually, perhaps catalyze the, the end of the, the Japanese. It was an existential threat to the Japanese civilization. So they hit it hard legally. And so now when, you know Japanese law, they're really focused on cannabis because of probably the American influence and meth. But psychedelics, most people in Japan probably don't know much about. There's a psychedelic subculture in Japan. There are ayahuasca circles in Japan that operate in a gray area of the law. It's not explicitly illegal. It's discouraged, but it's not explicitly illegal. I know people who import ayahuasca, raw ayahuasca drink from, from the Amazon and operate ayahuasca circles. You\n\nDidn't, did you do the DMTX experiments in Japan?\n\nNo. Where\n\nDid you do them?\n\nSo, okay, so we're gonna get into DMTX. Yeah. Yeah. So DMTX came from an idea that I had in 2015. I worked with Rick Strassman on this. So DMT is kind of unusual. It has these weird pharmacological peculiarities. It's, as I said before, it doesn't have subjective tolerance. So Rick Strassman showed in the nineties that you can inject someone with, with DMT repeatedly. And they have the same intensity effect at each time. But it also has another kind of a number of unique peculiarities. Of course. It's very, very brief. It's, it's, it enters the brain extremely rapidly. It's metabolized rapidly and cleared very rapidly. It had all of these pharmacological peculiarities. And it occurred to me that these were precisely the characteristics you need of a drug that's used in anesthesiology. So in anesthesiology, when they want to put you to sleep, make you unconscious. What they don't do, they don't just inject you with a drug and kind of hope that it keeps working whilst they've got you under the knife. What they do is they use a very short acting drug, and they use an infusion machine, which delivers the drug, the anesthetic drug into your veins and goes to your brain and holds the brain level of the drug constant over time so that they can keep you in the anesthetized state unconscious for as long or short period as they like. And so it occurred to me that, well, DMT has the right drug properties. It's like, it's almost like it's designed for that, that kind of technique called, it's called target controlled intravenous infusion. And so I thought, you know, if we start, if we take the DMT states seriously, and we treat it as a new world to explore and, you know, intelligent beings with whom we can establish communicative relationships, then three minutes of a breakthrough trip is nowhere near enough. And so I thought, well, let's take this technology from anesthesiology target controlled intravenous infusion, and let's repurpose it. So instead of an anesthetic drug that's delivered by programmed infusion, we instead deliver DMT by programmed infusion and induce somebody into the DMT state and stabilize their brain DM T levels. So you can hold them in the DMT state for 30 minutes, or potentially for several hours, and have complete control in real time over the depth of the experience. That was the idea. So I worked with Rick Strassman, I used his data, blood sampling data that he acquired in, in the nineties. You know, fortunately he had this old Excel file, which he sent to me. And I built this mathematical model of DMTs metabolism and distribution throughout the body. And then we wrote a paper basically saying, we think this should work. We think we should be able to extend the DM and stabilize the DMT state for many hours. But we didn't actually, it wasn't kind of human ready, so to speak. And it actually took about five years before it was actually implemented in humans. So that was actually done by the Imperial College London team. So they were the still are in a way, the leaders in, in psychedelic research and a guy called then a PhD student, I think Chris Timmerman worked to make this proof of principle model that myself and Rick Strassman had developed and, and get it human ready and actually test, you know, does it actually work? Do do the, do the predictions that we had, myself and Rick Strassman, do they actually work in humans? And they found out that in fact, that it does, that you can induce somebody into the DMT state and you can actually stabilize the experience. So rather than just being a, oh, Jamie, since I'm talking about this, I can show you actually what DMT trips or the kind of the time course of A DMT trip looks like over time. So normally what happens is the blood level will rise very, very rapidly. You inject some of the DMT blood levels rise, they reach the brain, and then almost immediately they start collapsing down again exponentially. And, and that brief period when the brain levels are high, is the breakthrough state. However, if you, when the brain DMT levels reach a kind of a peak, you then start an infusion. You can basically compensate for the DMT that's being lost by metabolism. It's a bit like if you have a, a bathtub full of water and you pull the plug the water drains. But if you turn on the taps Yeah. Mm. You can keep the level constant. Right? And so that's the infusion. So you, you, you stabilize the state. And our, our hope was that the actual experience itself, rather than that initial rollercoaster phase that you get with DMT, where it's all very, very disorienting and he's like, you know, what's going on? That's, for most people, that's, that's kind of it. And then you're dragged back out again. But our hope was that actually over time, if you stabilize the dm, the DMT in the brain, that it would actually stabilize the experience, then people can actually navigate and explore the space and even perform kind of experiments within the space. And this is what's become known as DMTX.\n\nHmm. And how was that? What did they describe?\n\nWell, so this first study that was done just a couple of years ago, as I said by Imperial College London, it was really a, it was like a pilot study. They wanted to show that it w that it worked and that it was safe, that it was tolerable, that people weren't going crazy, you know, that they could handle it. Basically, the very first person to do it was a guy I'm now working with. I, I work for a nonprofit called New Nordics Outta Florida. And we are very interested in designing experiments using DMTX to actually study the DMT space and, and the intelligences within them much more kind of formally. And on the board, I worked with a guy called Carl Smith, who was the, the very first person to undergo DMTX. He was also the only person to complete, I think there was five sessions over several weeks. He was the only one who oh boy, handled it, so to\n\nSpeak. Oh boy, what's his name?\n\nCarl Smith.\n\nShout out to Carl.\n\nShout out to Carl. You fucking\n\nPioneer.\n\nYou, you know. But what's interesting is that the, as we hoped and predicted, the, the DMT state, it does stabilize. It's like the brain is settling into constructing this alternate world model or interfacing with this, this, this intelligence. And he found that as he went back every time he was interacting with the same entities, and they became aware of the fact that he was coming back so often. And they were like, you know what, what are not you again? You know, you, you, you are back. And, and one time they were scanning him, the, the Imperial team in like a, I think like an MRI machine or something. And the entities were gathered, all the entities. He said, as soon as they started scanning me in the quote unquote real world, the entities were gathered and they seemed like curious or confused, like, well, what are\n\nThey doing? What are the signal? Right?\n\nYeah. Right. It's like, maybe it's the signal or something. Or they were like, you know, we are the ones that normally do the scanning or, you know, we're supposed to scan you, you know, what's going on here? So there's this, as I said, it was just a pilot study, but there's a real taste that you can enter into these, these kind of relationships with these entities. Oh. And actually we, as I said, I I, I work for this. I'm a, a board member of this nonprofit called New Nordics. And our vision is really to design experiments with DMTX. Like what would, what does a research organization look like that isn't simply trying to explain away DMT, explain it, but actually says, okay, this is a unchartered land that's, that's fascinated, that's inordinately complex and vast and filled with intelligences. Let's treat it like that. Right. As explorers, what does a research organization aimed at studying that look like? You know, and, and we imagine, I imagine that you're not just sending, you know, for example, let's take the structure of the DMT space, right? It's this highly complex geometrically and topologically strange domain. So we send in people who are experts, who are mathematicians. We send in a, a mathematician to study the topology of the space to study how the space is structured. The entities, they often try to communicate, they, they use strange symbols and strange code, oh, let's send in a, a linguist who can study their language. And so you are, you are sending in people with their own specialties to actually formally study the DMT space. Whoa. And what's even better is we now have a venue for this. So we're actually, we have a, I work with a company called Elis. We have a special license from a, a, a country in the Caribbean, St. Vincent and the Grenadines. And we, we are setting up a retreat center, stroke research center to provide DMTX that is a hundred percent legal. That is safe. You know, you've got anesthesiologists, psychiatrists and nurses, you know, a perfect setting that's also being designed in part by Carl Smith as well, that allows you to perform these kind of research, research studies aimed at analyzing and studying the DMT space. But even better is it's also gonna be open to anyone. So if you think about, prepare\n\nFor the freaks,\n\nPrepare for the, they're coming. But like, you know, in, in the nineties, Rick Strassman, he did the biggest study of its kind. You've only had 60 people, right? So you've got 60 people worth of trip reports. What happens if you can bring in 300, 400, 500 people a year? How will you\n\nVet people to make sure they're not crazy before they do it?\n\nThere will be a screening process of an initial screening process, and then ultimately you would have a psychiatrist who would sign them off. So it's not just anyone, but anyone can, in theory, they can sign up, they can go to luc mind.com and they can put their name down and sign up to fly to this island Beck Way, I think it's called. And in a beautiful, perfect setting, spend a week on the island and undergoing a number of DMTX sessions and, you know, being able to explore this world using the DMTX technology. And of course they will all be providing trip reports. So you, you start to amass a, a vast data set of highly controlled verified, you know, this isn't, this isn't like posting online where you, you don't know what drugs they've taken really. Right. Right. It's like, you know exactly what they've taken. It's pure pharmaceutical grade DMT, and they, they will generate this vast data set that could be used. We are also working to develop a, an AI powered model that would take in this verbal data and in real time, generate imagery. So someone can talk to the, the model, the AI model, and it will generate the image. And then you say, oh no, this isn't quite right. This needs to be more like this. And so you are converging on the,\n\nYou're making a map of the\n\nTerritory. You're make making a map of the territory. And so you, you end up with this vast library, not just of textual trip reports, but also of, of imagery.\n\nAnd this is available now. It\n\nWill, it's opening. We're kind of it, we're building it, it's being developed now.",

And then I forget that my ears have water in 'em and then they come out like, oh, there's that moment where like, oh, this is how I hear. Oh,\n\nI feel like I have the in ear monitors for my job. And\n\nOh,\n\nRight. I still, like, I've been using 'em for, I don't know, 20 years and I'm still not used to 'em. Like, I come from like honky tonk world where you can hear everything. Yeah.

And so many of my friends who shoot guns too, same thing. Yeah. You know, they started hunting when they were kids and no ear protection back then. Yeah. And you know, you, you say something to them and they're like, what? Like they're all, they're all half\n\nDeath. Yeah. My dad was a police officer and he's, I swear that's why my parents are still married because he can't hear it all. And the dog ate his hearing aid and he never replaced it. And I'm like, is that on purpose, dad? That's\n\nHilarious. That's hilarious. Yeah. You definitely develop an ability to shut things off. Yeah. Otherwise, because men and women think and communicate differently. Yeah. And if you want your wife to communicate with you the way your buddies do, then Well, you married a dude. Yeah. Okay. So if you want to be married to a woman, you have to listen. You have to like, listen and everything with both ears. And sometimes it's like round about journey to get to the point and you can't go, what the fuck are you talking about? 'cause then they're like, oh my God, why are you so hostile? So you have to go. Okay.\n\nOkay. Selective hearing.\n\nYeah, selective hearing.\n\nBut my husband will like, I'll say it and I'll be like, say it back to me. And like, and I found that when I do that, it's worse because I'm like, I'm like, say, say what I said back to you get bananas at the store. So he comes home, I'm like, where's bananas? I didn't get any. So don't repeat it. Just hold it in there.\n\nThat's hilarious. He blocked it out for himself.\n\nYeah, exactly.\n\nThat's very funny. Yeah.

Like, just, I mean, I, I've had the in-ears for a long time and they did save all of our ears. But it's like, I think that, and then like, the longer you go, like still, even though I have those, like I turn them up way too loud. Oh, do you? Because I'm like missing. Right. The energy. And so\n\nDo you ever, you ever just say, fuck it for this\n\nShow, take one out. Like sometimes when it's like a house band, you just get to use wedges. I'm like, yes. This is amazing. What's a wedge? It's just like the little onstage monitor. Oh, right. You know what I mean? So, but it's just so loud. I mean, it's so loud. And I also do, I do mounted shooting. And so\n\nI saw that. That's crazy.\n\nAnd so it's a good reminder. Like the first time I took off on the first, I just started last year. I'm not good at all, but I love it. And I took off on my horse and I forgot to wear ear plugs. And I was like, well, I, I'm a musician. I probably plug my ears when I'm shooting a revolver off of a horse.\n\nYeah. But it's, is it a revolver using a regular bullet? No, it's black\n\nPowder.\n\nJust the powder itself. Yep. So it's just\n\nA spectator safe horse safe.\n\nSo it just sprays, sprays\n\nPowder.\n\nPowder and air\n\nAt the balloon.\n\nAnd it pops balloons. Yeah. At how, what, what distance\n\nIt could shoot, I think 15\n\nYards. Feet. Feet. Oh, okay. Yeah. So you're just riding around the horse popping balloons.\n\nI love it. I do.\n\nWhat was the origin of that sport?\n\nI don't know. Actually, one of my best friends, her name is Ken Sane, and she lives out in Scottsdale. She's like the 10 time world champion and whoa,\n\nWhoa. Hold on. We became, there's a world championship of popping balloons on a horse. Yeah.\n\nIt's called mounted shooting. And Oh, cowboy mounted shooting. But she's cowgirl and she's like, guys', girls, everybody, she's a badass. And became friends with her. And I just never had the guts to go do it, you know? And finally my husband was like, stop talking about it and go out there and do it. Go out there and shoot with her. You're gonna love it. Wow. And I got addicted immediately. It's just like something different.\n\nWell, it's very wild west, right? Oh yeah. It's essentially training how to fight with a gun on a horse. Yeah. That's all it is.\n\nExcept it's the balloon is the Yeah. Perpetrator.\n\nBut I mean it's, that's how you would train. Yeah. It's super Right. Without killing people.\n\nIt's super fun. And it's like, you know, just something that like started a new hobby at 40. Like, it's just try to like preoccupy my mind and, and I don't know, I think it inspires me to like, take a break from thinking about what I think about every single day, which is music industry, you know? So just like trying new things and saying, what the hell, let's go for it.\n\nI think that's very good for artists. I, I try to talk to comedians about that all the time. I'm like, get pick up something, man. Yeah. Like\n\nHobbies are\n\nImportant. Play golf. Go fishing. Do something. Yeah. For me, I play pool, do something. So\n\nI just started golf too. Oh, I remember. I try new things. Era. There\n\nYou go. You try new things. Era. Yes.\n\nMy, my yes. Era. Like sure, I'll do it. Started golf. Not too great yet, but I did, I just played the Ryder Cup.\n\nOh, nice.\n\nThey had like a celebrity. Hmm. Somebody heard, I played golf and I, when they heard that, I literally started like that day.\n\nJamie's a nut and I Jamie's a full on golf nut. Like\n\nHe's literally was like cramming my ass off like this September because I was on tour all summer and I didn't have time to practice. And you know how that feels like golf is, you have to practice and do you have a\n\nCoach?\n\nI had a coach, yes. No, Dan, I have a coach and he came with me as my caddy. Very helpful. But it was, it was an experience. It was a lot of pressure. Like,\n\nDid you feel it even though like, no, it didn't expect you to win. Oh my\n\nLike, yeah. I mean I just felt like, what, what, what the hell have I done when I got there? It's like, play doing something you don't do in front of people. Right. A\n\nLot of people. But you do it, you just don't do it a lot.\n\nYeah. And I don't, I do things in front of people, but it's singing.\n\nYou do things in front of people and you're really good at it. That's the difference.\n\nWell that's the thing. Doing something that you suck at in front of people is a very scary place to be. Right.\n\nRight. Jamie has OJ Simpson's golf clubs,\n\nA couple of them. Not all of 'em. I have a few. That's\n\nAwesome. How many do you have? It's not really awesome at all. Drivers? Well, I mean, they're haunted.\n\nWhatever you're into\n\nCouple. Dr. How many you got? Three.\n\nNo, I mean I got a whole, whole set. But\n\nDo you use them?\n\nI I used one of them.\n\nD is, did you hit Well?\n\nI have, that's why I used it.\n\nWhy are they blister curse? I\n\nDunno. I mean, well, he bought it as a goof, you know.\n\nYeah. It's just fun to talk about. It's a fun\n\nJoke. Just one of those things. Conversation starter. It came up. Was it, did you get 'em after he died? Yeah,\n\nYeah. Yeah. I mean, I got 'em like six months ago. Yeah.\n\nI forgot. I forget when he died\n\nA couple years ago.\n\nWell, that's cool. I mean, I,\n\nI guess, but it is really important having some kind of a thing that you do to take your mind off of the business. 'cause the people that I know where their mind is only on show business, whatever it is, music, comedy, whatever it is, they go crazy. You, you can eventually get lost in your own little world. Yeah. Like you need a little break.\n\nYou do. And I, I think it's like, you know, especially if you're like a writer, like you gotta go live to write about it or what are you writing about? Same shit you already said. Right. You know? Right. It's like I need to go live a life and gather information and be around different people and Yeah. Sort of open my circle up to just, I don't know, different experiences. Something Yeah. A different environment. Yeah.\n\nYeah. My friend Ari does that. He disappears for like three months every year and a half or so. Like, he gets rid of his phone, gets rid of his email, he\n\nLike goes off grid.\n\nOh, he goes off grid. He goes to Asia. He backpacks through Asia and he's famous. He's a famous comedian and he doesn't give a fuck. He just goes and vanishes for like, we can't find him. No one knows where he is. I don't hear from him for like three, four months. I just hope he's alive.\n\nDoes it change him?\n\nOh yeah. He comes back weird. He's weird already. He's weird as fuck. Weirder. He's weirder when he comes back. 'cause he is, you know, been living in foreign countries for, you know, a long time. Yeah. This episode is brought to you by the farmer's dog.

Right. You know, there's no room. You just, you're just doing that thing only.\n\nYeah. That's what, what, that's what I think I loved about it and got addicted to. Yeah. You know, and I guess I don't really have, I always say I don't have like an adrenaline junkie in me, but I guess I'd have to have a little bit for joining the circus like I did. You know, like Yes, you do.\n\nIt's kind of joining the circus. It's,\n\nYeah. So, but like, I think that just that little, that the focus and the little jolt Right. That you get of like, you know, the, the same kind of high we get like after a show, you know, it's like, right. I still guess I need that, but just in a different form.\n\nYeah. Joining the rodeo. Yeah. There's, there's something about shooting at things too. I do archery and there's something about shooting at things that also just really cleans your mind because in that moment, while you're pulling a trigger, there's no room for anything else. Yeah. If you're trying to hit a target, there's no room for anything else and it just, it pushes all that stuff away. Right. It gives you like a little, little mental vacation. Yeah.\n\nA hundred percent. And then\n\nYou come back like cleaner. What kind of\n\nBow are you shooting?\n\nI shoot a compound bow. Compound bow. Yeah. A Hoyt. Yeah.\n\nYeah. I used to shoot bows. I have a long time, but Oh really? I, I got 'em back out during 2020 when I had all the time in the world. And my husband's from New York City so I was like, I got these bows, I'll, I'll teach you how to shoot a bow. So we just set up the targets and got 'em all fixed stuff and it was fun. I mean it is fun. It's the same thing I think you're talking about.\n\nIt's very similar.\n\nIt's focus. It's just, even if it's just for a little while, it's that little moment in time that this is all I'm doing right now.\n\nRight. Have you ever bow hunted?\n\nI used to be a hunter. Yeah. Yeah. Yep. I did. I hunted for a long time. My dad tree\n\nStand. Yep.\n\nOkay. Or ground blind either way. Right. Bow hunting was my absolute favorite to, to do because it took the focus and it was intimate. Yeah. And it took a lot of skill and practice. Certainly bow hunting to make sure you're gonna Yeah. White tail. White tail. Oh\n\nNice.\n\nBut I raised a baby deer a buck. Aw,\n\nThat's a problem. Yep.\n\nThat's a problem. So my hunting days are behind me. Peace on my heart.\n\nWe found a buck with a broken leg on our property and my wife took to feeding it. Yeah. And all of her enthusiasm for me hunting kind of went out the window.\n\nIt changes things. Yeah.\n\nBecause it's kind of like a dog. Like they're,\n\nThey're they, he was just like a dog. Like they, they're sweet. A full grown,\n\nThey come right up to you. Yep.\n\nWild ass whitetail, deer like became like my pet.\n\nAnd it's different than any other feral animal in that they domesticate like that\n\nThey really do. Like he was literally, I'd come home and he would run over to me like a dog. So definitely changed my mind.\n\nWell I think it's because they're dumb. Unfortunately. I think nature has them set up to be not very intelligent and just food. Yeah. You know, and he's a beautiful food thing. Yeah. That's really what they are.\n\nYeah. My dad, my dad, you know, I grew up hunting with him, like taught me how to shoot a gun and all that stuff at 17. And when I raised that buck, he was like, it's over, isn't it? Yeah.\n\nIt's\n\nOver. It's over.\n\nIt's over. Yeah. I'll never raise a baby elk, I'll tell you that. Yeah.\n\nDon't do it. I don't love elk hunting too much.\n\nYeah. But I, I get it. I mean we have deer in our neighborhood and I see these little cute babies that are born every year and you know, we stop the car. Oh my God.\n\nEspecially so cute.",

      "transcript_chunk": "uld listen to stories that they would tell me about like things that they got into and they were getting into things like that. Like on a daily basis. Yeah. There was always shootouts, there was always car wrecks. There was always murders and domestic violence cases. And it's like, man, how many of those guys are just walking around with severe PTSD. Yeah. And no one cares. No one respects it.\n\nNo one's talking about it. No. Like they're just, you know, I, I think that like they don't even acknowledge it themselves. Like I know my dad worked vice in Dallas for his whole career and Woo. And back in the day like, and my and my husband like they just don't, and then they just come home and like, you know, I'd\n\nKill my hearing aids too. Like\n\nHe's like the dog ate, I guarantee you that. He just threw it away.\n\nHe fed it to put peanut butter on that fucking thing.\n\nGood job Reclaimer. We know what you did. Now he put peanut butter on it. That's just wrong. It's just wrong in so many ways.\n\nYeah man. He probably needed peace it and quiet. Yeah.\n\nHe needs mom to hush.\n\nYeah. Everybody shut the fucking world off. Yeah. You know the, one of the greatest pool players, if not the greatest pool player of all time is deaf. There's a guy named Shane Van Boning. Really? And he shuts his hearing aid off when he plays Just\n\nSo it's just silent. Yeah. Just\n\nFuck off world. Wow. And he's just in his like you people could be screaming in the crowd and he doesn't hear shit.\n\nWhat is it about pool? Like what's the, you said you play pool, you like\n\nIt. I've been playing pool for 35 years. Yeah, I've been playing forever.\n\nBut what is it about that particular,\n\nBecause the balls don't give a fuck who you are. They don't care what you think you are, they don't care who you know how much money you have. You know what you've accomplished already. How many shots you've already made. The balls don't care. The pockets are four and a quarter inches wide. And if you don't hit it perfect, it doesn't go in and it requires all of your concentration. And if you really know how to play pool, then you're dealing with like English. So you're dealing with like spin on the cue ball left and right and you're dealing with draw and follow. It's a dance of the mind in these orbs. You're hitting a ball into another ball and trying to get that thing to go straight. And it just requires this complete harmony of hand eye coordination and your spirit. Like you have to like stay calm while you're doing it. That's why\n\nGod, that's a very, that's a very good explanation of that. I'm the worst pool player of all. I mean you would think like playing as many honky tonks as I have played that I could play pool.\n\nMost\n\nPeople, it's so bad.\n\nPeople that think they could play pool can't play pool.\n\nMost people don't.\n\nIt's like, don't know really how to play pool.\n\nLike back in my day it was like just a place to flirt.\n\nYeah. It's that. It's that. The thing about pool is once you get down the road and you start to understand, you get, you really start getting the game and understanding the, and then playing in tournaments and then gambling. Then you're dealing with like real pool players. And these real pool players play pool eight hours a day.\n\nWow.\n\nEvery day you have to because you know how the thing of like being comfortable on stage or being comfortable riding a horse or being comfortable like shooting a bow or, or playing golf. Multiply that times a hundred and you have pool because pool's the only game where you take a stick and you hit a ball into another ball Every other game you hit a ball, you just hit a ball with a stick. But in pool you're hitting a ball into a ball and controlling the movement of both balls. Like the one that's hitting the ball. You're controlling how it spins off to get perfect position on the next shot. And then the other one, you wanna make sure it gets the exact right angle to go into the pocket while you're like calculating all this spin and the geometry of the table and Void collisions. It's maddening.\n\nIt's very like, I just got anxiety. It's maddening. I just got stressed out. It'll\n\nDrive you crazy. It'll, it's a game that will drive you crazy. But when you catch it, there's a thing called being in stroke and and being in dead stroke. It's a rare thing. It happens like, you know, once a month or something like that where you just can't miss where you know where everything is and it's just like calm that comes over like the world dissolves and all you feel is the table and you're completely in sync with the movement of the balls. You know how many revolutions each ball is gonna make. You feel the difference between two extra revolutions, like you know where, how hard to hit it. Exactly. And that's what everybody's chasing. They're chasing this feeling of being in dead\n\nStroke. Why does it happen happen once a month because\n\nIt's so hard to get there. You, you'd probably get, I'd probably get there all the time. If I played like a pro like eight hours a day. You probably get there once a week, but nobody stays there.\n\nBut that's probably the draw that keeps you coming back to it.\n\nYeah. Dudes do drugs just so they can get there. They get hooked on pills they get because they find that like maybe it's amphetamines, maybe it's opiates, whatever it is. Like some guys will do drugs and find that spot and then go back to drugs just to get to that spot.\n\nFrom pool. From\n\nPool. Yeah. Dang. Oh it's a nutty game.\n\nI mean I've never, it's a nutty game ever dug, dug into it like that but\n\nOh, at the highest levels. Guys are gambling from hundreds of thousands of dollars in these fucking weird places in Kentucky and weird pool hall. And they're streaming online on YouTube. They're streaming on different websites. Dang. Oh, it's at the highest level. It is a crazy game. It's a crazy game.\n\nWell I never knew that, but I learned a lot about that\n\nToday. I know a dude who's one of the best in the world and he can't travel because he needs pills. 'cause he so he can't go like overseas. He can't go anywhere. He can't travel without his pills. If he does, he won't play. Right.\n\nReally?\n\nOh, it's nuts. Yeah,\n\nIt's a head game.\n\nOh, what's that? That's it. It's, there's my friend Jeremy Jones, he won the US Open when greatest players of all time. He's like, it is the MO and he plays everything. He played baseball like at a high level. He plays golf plays. He's like, it is the most mental game really. And that's why nobody's good at it. That's why it never gets to a, it never got to a place where it was like really appreciated professionally. Right. Because you have to know how to play it to be, to understand what you're seeing. Yeah. To really see people play well, you have to know what the, what's happening.\n\nI don't, I'd never, I'm not like good at any, I've not played sports, so I'm not good at them.\n\nNo sports\n\nAt all. Well, I didn't really, I mean, I grew up kind of playing softball here and there, or so is golf.\n\nLike the\n\nFirst thing, golf is my first and my mount shooting, which is technically labeled a sport.\n\nThat's a sport for sure.\n\nSo that's like, it's new to me. Like sports are new because I just, I don't know. I started this at 17 and didn't and just was laser focused, like horse with blinders doing country music. And then what\n\nIs it like going from just being a regular high school kid and all of a sudden 17 just being thrust into a spotlight?\n\nWell, I wasn't in the spotlight at first. I was playing shit holes with no lights. But\n\nEven shithole, there's some kind light You're on stage\n\nThe pole light. Yeah. Well, well, I, I don't know. Like, I just, I don't know. I, I feel like that I, I didn't have a choice. It picked me. Like I, it's the only thing I've ever been good at. Everything is hard. It, everything else is hard to me. But like music was the only thing that I was like, I guess that's what I'm supposed to do. 'cause I'm actually good at it. Like, thank god it comes naturally\n\nFollowed it though. So many people have a thing like that and they say, oh, that's just unrealistic. I can't do that.\n\nI didn't have a backup plan that helped. There was that I, I barely graduated high school. I was like, I don't wanna waste my dad's money. That does help Going to college. I was like, I have no backup plan. So like, it really does help. The hunger that it creates is like a fire that you can't explain.\n\nYeah. You know, and it's not good advice. I would never give the advice of don't have a backup plan because some people are not gonna make it. No, you're right. And then they'll blame you. Yeah. You know, you're told me I shouldn't have a backup plan. Yeah. But I really think that for someone who's got some talent and some, a real desire to do that, and, and you can stay the course and you could deal with the hard times. Like you can't have a backup plan. You cannot, because that backup plan will rob your time. Yeah. That's the thing you have to think of. Yeah. It robs your focus. Yeah. It steals from your energy. Yeah. So it'll stop you from reaching your full potential. Fuck your backup plans.\n\nYeah. I mean, it didn't come from me. Yeah.\n\nIt came from me. Fuck your backup plan.\n\nAnd I don't wanna get blamed, but I, I just think that's like, the reason that it happened is a lot of hard work, obviously, and determination, but just nothing else. I have nothing else. Like I was terrible at school, terrible at sports. Had to get tutoring, had to like, stay late for the cheerleading dance. Like everything was just hard for me.\n\nRight. But that's just because you're a great singer. Like that's where your mind works. Like, it's just such a wonderful thing that you found the thing that you're really good at. 'cause some people, some people don't, they just don't know why they, they suck at school. They don't know why they can't pay attention. They don't know why they can't be at work on time. They don't know why. They're like, what's wrong with me? And if maybe that person just found that thing and they're like, oh my God, I'm supposed to be riding horses and shooting balloons. Exactly.\n\nHere I'm, I found me. Yeah. I think it's, I I feel like we're the lucky ones when we get to like, we know like, this is, this is what I'm supposed to do. This is what I'm gonna chase no matter what it costs. And you know, that doesn't, I see so many people that are so immensely talented that just didn't happen for, and Yeah. And you don't, and you don't know why. Like the why you said it, you don't know if it was one little factor of a period in their life or just not seen at the right time or chasing the right thing at the right time. And I don't know, I feel, I feel very thankful for that. But I'm also like trying to learn new things at 40 because I spent my whole adult life doing that. You know what I mean? Yeah. So now I'm like, what can we do next? Let's find another hobby. But that's\n\nA great approach though. Yeah. That's great. I mean, it's recognizing you want to have some more stuff in your life. That's interesting.\n\nI think that does come, I don't know. Does that come with like\n\nWisdom with age,\n\nAge wisdom and, and also feeling accomplished? Yes. I mean, I feel like I set my goals, I hit them. Yeah. You know, and that feels like, oh,\n\nThis episode is brought to you by Goldbelly. This is insane.

There's gotta be a part that, you know, you can relax a little. Like not that you know, you will, you know, when comes to like writing and singing and stuff. Yeah. But at least you don't have to worry. Like, am I gonna make it like, all right. Kind of made it like,\n\nOkay, let have some fun.\n\nYeah. And what's disappointing ma? The whole idea of making it is like your life will be better and you'll have Well your life will be better if you have more fun. Yeah. Like find some stuff you like to do.\n\nExactly. You seem like somebody that chases a lot of new things and conquers them, which I think is really inspiring.\n\nWell, I chase things that can never conquer. That's, that's the key.\n\nWell, that's like that. And no one told me that till I started playing golf and now it's too late.\n\nYeah. Well\n\nYou can't ever win.\n\nFor me, it started with martial arts. You never conquer that. You, there's always gonna be somebody better than you. Especially if you're not a professional,\n\nBut you get really, really good at the things that you're pursuing.\n\nBut it's probably mental.\n\nYou spend time on that illness.\n\nSomething wrong with me. I, I'm for sure if I was born at a different time. I was born in the sixties. They didn't really diagnose kids with a DHD when I was a kid. And\n\nOh, we both have it dope\n\n'em up a hundred percent.\n\nWe a hundred percent have it. A hundred\n\nPercent. I got it. Whatever that fuck it is. It's a superpower. It's a superpower if you use it, right? Yeah,\n\nI think so too.\n\nYeah. Just the idea that you have to medicate a kid 'cause he can't sit in school. Like find out if that kid's good at other stuff. Right. Find out if there's a thing that a hundred percent. Yeah. Okay. Maybe they can't sit there where someone's teaching them math. Maybe they get bored real quick. Maybe they start talking to her friends, whatever it is, they probably have a thing they're really good at. If they could find that thing. I bet they're focused like a motherfucker when they're playing video games. Right? Yeah. So what's that all about? You know, find the thing that that kid can lock into. A\n\nHundred percent agree. Yeah.\n\nThe thing is like, you make people do things that are completely unnatural. You make people sit down when they're six in a chair. Why? Some lady who's making $35,000 a year doesn't like kids is teaching them some shit that she doesn't care about. So there's no energy in the room. Yeah. Everything. And then when they're out in the yard with their friends are having fun and they're laughing and mad, so they're looking around, this is\n\nBullshit.\n\nThis class sucks. And they're talking to each other. And then they get in trouble for talking like, Ugh. Yeah, your child's a problem. Is the child really the problem? Seems like the child has a lot of energy. That's not a problem. Yeah. You just, you're not providing an inspiring environment for a, a growing mind. Just turning you into a, a dull drone. Some worker that just is capable of like shutting themselves off all day and then showing up and then just doing some stuff that they don't wanna do because they were taught how to do it when they were a kid. Like blah.\n\nI feel like there's a lot more opportunities now than there was.",

There's something to it. As much as I my mind want, my rational mind wants to ignore the possibility, like the randomness of the universe, the size and scope of it all. Do you really think it matters what you do you really think? But it does to you. Right. It has a giant impact on your life and everything matters. Just because there's black holes doesn't mean your fucking, your homework doesn't matter. You know, everything matters. Right. Your whole world, everything matters. It's like, you can't think that things don't matter like that. The universe wouldn't have a plan for your life when it seems to have a plan for everything. Yeah. I mean all of it seems to be happening for some sort of a very bizarre reason. Yeah. All of it together. So I'm sure that there's something to fate, but it's just my rational mind wants to go. That's just your ego. It's like silly. You could have been bored in Somalia, you know, life could have sucked for you. You know, it's, it's hard to, because fate's a weird one. Like you can't measure it, can't put it on a scale, but it seems to be real.\n\nYeah. What's real for us. Yeah. So then it's real,\n\nI guess\n\nNow also I'm like, your ceiling is giving me Yeah. I love it. The little shooting stars. Yeah. And you were like, fade is real. And it was like, boom. And I was like, yeah, it's,\n\nIf I don't tell people I didn't tell you, but sometimes people,\n\nI love it.\n\nThey're like, am I having flashbacks? Like, what's going on?\n\nIt's awesome. That's what I love about West Texas. Something about like, it's just so vast in the middle of nowhere. Mm. Like the stars are, they feel like they're, we call it the thunderdome when we're, we like lay in the yard and it just feels like they're, you could reach up and grab them because it's so dark out there. Yeah. It's magical.\n\nWell, they're on top of you and you don't have any light pollution. Yeah. Yeah. That's the thing that ruins the world. Yeah. That's the problem with New York City. That's why everybody's so stew. They're, they're like so like stuck in their own world. Just 'cause like they don't realize they're in space.\n\nExactly.\n\nYou know? Yeah. You don't get that break. Yeah.\n\nNo\n\nBreaks. This is a, a break that you get from space that I don't think you get from anything else where you just like look up and you go, oh yeah, okay. I'm taking all this shit way too seriously. Yeah. This is nuts. Like just above us.\n\nIt totally is. And I also, when you said that, it made me think of what we were talking about earlier about wisdom and like, I don't know, just kind of reaching some goals and taking a breath and calming down and going, okay, everything's okay. It's like I just feel like I saw she starting lost my train of thought. I have a DHD, I'm like, I lost my whole maybe to shut the ball.\n\nWell we were talking about space. What\n\nHappened?

What are you zening over there? What are those?\n\nOh, these are loosies. They're breakers. You, do you ever take these?\n\nI don't dunno what they are, but it's, I like zens.\n\nYou like the Here try these. These these are strong though. They're Oh,\n\nLike what Sixes?\n\nNine. Oh,\n\nI'll pass out.\n\nYeah, don't do it. I'm\n\nNot doing it. That's not for you. I'm not doing it.\n\nThis is strong. This one's not. Yeah, these are nines. I got some\n\nFours\n\nOver here. Oh, you got some fours? Yeah. Oh. Chuck me a fours. Huh?\n\nWhat are, what's the loosies, why are they different?\n\nThey have like a little thing inside of 'em that you, you, they're called breakers. Okay. So what do you do? So it's like coffee flavor you put in your mouth\n\nJust like it in\n\nYeah. And you crack that little sucker open. It gives you a little blast\n\nOf flavor. A little, yeah. Little sugar. Almost like a little, yeah. Piece of cupcake. Little pizza candy\n\nIn there for You. Good. Those are fours, right? So it's not bad. Oh lord. That's a nice, I get up\n\nFour's nice if I get up and run outta here. Saw I already couldn't concentrate 'cause of the shooting.\n\nI saw a dude online. He got a a 50 milligram one from overseas. What? Yeah. And he tried it and you know, he was violently ill lying on the ground. Like\n\nA terrible, why would you do that?\n\nWell I think he did it for props, you know, like, so he could get some online cred just for the views. Did it for the gram, did it\n\nWork?\n\nI mean, I guess you it, I watched it. I wanted to, I'm like, you're gonna take a 50. Oh you're fucked dude. And he said, oh my god, it's like drinking battery acid. And then he was lying on the ground at the end of it. It was like, I really fucked up. I made a giant mistake. 'cause it's so much nicotine. 50\n\nMilligrams is crazy. But, but you're so like, so into health and just take such good care of yourself. And I What is the bit what? Like why are I just tell people, oh they're good for you have one. Well what do you think? Like tell me your opinion of these. There's this whole craze, there's\n\nNicotine is not bad for you. Correct. The delivery method is what's bad for you. And the delivery method with cigarettes in particular with cigarettes that have a bunch of chemicals added to them that's even worse. Like the regular cigarettes. Like natural cigarettes I bet are probably not as bad for you. Dr. Suzanne Humphreys, she's a, a physician who was on here was explaining to us like why regular cigarettes are not as bad, but there's still, it's still not good for you, you smoking in your lungs. But nicotine itself is not bad. Nicotine itself is neuroprotectant. Nicotine itself actually is a nootropic. So, which means it's cognitively enhancing. So nootropics are like vitamins that help brain function. And there's a bunch of 'em, like have some here we have some stuff called Alpha Brain. That's great. I've seen that. There's a bunch of companies that make different versions of a nootropic, but there are, there are nutrients that enhance memory and enhance your verbal, verbal memory. So your ability to recall words that can enhance peak alpha flow state. Like they've done like real, they've done two double-blind placebo controlled studies at the Boston Center for Memory with Alpha Brain. It shows more effectiveness than any of the drugs that they had studied over the past, like nine months before they did this. So like, this is pretty impressive. So nicotine does That too? Yeah. Nicotine enhances your memory. Enhances brain function. Enhances it, stimulates you. So there's a lot of benefits to nicotine as a, but the problem is like, how do you take it? How are you taking your nicotine? You know, probably one of the best ways is maybe gum, you know, and these, these things\n\nBecause people are wearing patches now and stuff. Oh, fucking\n\nCrazy people. That's Ron White. He wears a goddamn patch. What you doing Ron? I got a patch on it. I'm smoking. He's got a cigar. He is got a zen fucking animal. But\n\nSo good.\n\nHe's such an animal. But I think there's, there's real benefit to, I know a guy who puts a nicotine patch on for productivity when he writes.\n\nWell that makes sense to me. Like I feel like, 'cause all the songwriters are, you know, right now it's everybody in Nashville's singing and I'm like, oh, I'll try one. And it like really does give you a little\n\nStimulant.\n\nYeah. And also have a lot of words in my head. I need to remember words and I also need to write new words. You should. So anything to help with that.\n\nAnything you want. If you want help with memory. Alpha Brain's a really good one's.\n\nI wanna try that because that's a good one. I just think like at some point too, when you're tired, you know, it just, it feels like you, like you can't, I mean you just saw me lose my train of thought. It's like I don't wanna be on like a bunch of Adderall and stuff. No. I wanna be on, I wanna find a different method to like have my brain functioning. Eat the best it can. These\n\nAre addictive though. And I gotta say different people have different levels of like how addicted they get with these. Like some people can't not have them. I went on vacation, I said I'm gonna go on vacation and not bring any and see what happens. See if I freak out just to see and nothing, zero nothing. It was like I kind of missed them maybe for a day or two. Like wanted one didn't have any. And then after like three days I was like, oh, this is fine. Yeah. It's not, it's not like a physical like, oh my God I'm jonesy.\n\nIt's not like smoking.\n\nI'm a shaken. Yeah. Yeah. But I've, I know people that have tried to get off of 'em that really struggle.\n\nI mean, it, it is addictive. I mean it's nicotine. I\n\nThink the vapes are the hardest to get off of\n\nThe vapes. Like that's, I don't want heat on my voice either, you\n\nKnow? Right. That's, well, vapes aren't really hot, but it is. If you buy them ones that are like in the gas station, like who knows where those are\n\nBeing, but like, but the ones that heat up.\n\nOh yeah. The crazy ones. I like that. Adam Curry. Do you know Adam Curry is, he's the first podcaster. He used to be the MTVV. Oh yeah. Dkng. Yes. Guy with beautiful hair.\n\nYeah.\n\nYes. Good. Good friend of mine. He carries around one of those robot lunchbox vapes. Those big old crazy ones. Yeah. Where you're blowing murder\n\nAnd it makes like noise. It's\n\nLike kind of like a power bar on the side of it. So much. It's so ridiculous. And he blows this giant, but it's all like, he, he fills it with natural oil. So it's air quotes healthy. Oh, air quotes. Yeah. But\n\nThat's what they, that's what people say. They smoke American spirits.\n\nYeah. It's healthy. Come on, there's an Indian on there. Yeah,\n\nExactly.\n\nHow come they get away with that? Is, are American spirits owned by Native Americans? No. No. So how the fuck do they have a Native American on there? Not catch any slack. They do, right? Don't they have\n\nAn's a badass pack? They got in trouble in the past for stuff.\n\nSo did they? Yeah, I'm not,\n\nI'm not getting\n\nInto it. Oh. Getting into tobacco company problems.\n\nHe was like, and Pivot.\n\nDid you ever see that movie The Insider with Russell Crow? I don't think so. It's about a guy who works for a tobacco company that is explaining, he was a chemist and he was explaining how they added all these different things to make it more addictive. And they're trying to kill him in the film. 'cause they don't want that information getting out. Ooh. He's the insider. It's kind of crazy movie and based on a true story. Wow. Yeah. I watch that they, they put a bunch of shit in cigarettes to try to get you hooked. Well,\n\nAnd they do it. Yeah. I mean it works people. It does. That's the hardest one. I feel like it's, it's the most, you hear people talking about trying to quit that and drinking to me like, you know what I mean? Just on the daily. Like I'm in a band so everybody's like, oh I quit now they're all like, do you go to Zen? You got a Zen like Yeah because it's just highly addictive. I guess\n\nIt's, it is, but it's, it's people want something. They just want something to take 'em outta whatever state they're in. Gimme something. Gimme a drink, gimme this, gimme a coffee. Like everybody I know that's an Alcoholic's Anonymous. They all smoke or drink tons of coffee. It's either or both. Yes. Because they're just want to do something. Get me. Something's not gonna make me suck dick for bus fare, but I'm gonna least get a little bit of something different than regular life. I don't wanna be homeless. I don't wanna be cracked out. But yeah, gimme something. Yeah, just gimme a little something. Take me away from wherever I am right now. Yeah.\n\nNot that far away. Just a little bit away.\n\nIt's that little next door. Let me go next door and hide.\n\nI'm gonna start saying that way. I'm like, can I have his in? Can I go? I, I need to go next door.\n\nYeah, I'm gonna go next door just a little bit. I don't wanna go too far away. I could hear everybody but\n\nAm I supposed to like break this little candy thing?\n\nI do. Yeah. I break it right away. It just crack down on that little sucker. What's\n\nIn there?\n\nProbably candy. Ooh, nice. Right. That's\n\nLike a little burst of happiness.\n\nWell burst of flavor.\n\nYeah. Oh wait, next door.\n\nI like those. I like those. That's funny. My buddy Duncan found out that his blood sugar goes up when he vapes. 'cause he was buying those gas station vapes and you know he got, it's terrible. He got type two diabetes 'cause he was eating too much sugar. He's okay, don't worry. But he realized 'cause he monitors his blood glucose that like when he was vaping his blood was going through the roof. I go, okay. Why do you think that is? Like, why do you think it's strawberry flavored? What the fuck do you think's in there, bro? You're eating candy all day. Like you're vaping on sugar. Oh\n\nIt's like sugar. Yeah. Oils. Yeah. Yeah.\n\nIt has to be. Yeah it has to be. I mean if it's like grape flavored or whatever the hell it is, it's like there's some, some also, who knows what kind of oil they're putting in those damn things. It\n\nStinks\n\nPretty. It's probably made in China or somewhere. I watched a video on TikTok of these dudes testing them some. Some dude is just sucking on each one of 'em to make sure they work at the factory.\n\nWhat's gonna happen to him?\n\nI don't know what's gonna happen to you because you're sucking on the same one that he was sucking on. Nobody cleans those things off. You just get 'em at the gas station and stick it right in your mouth. That's\n\nLike a karaoke mic. Yes. That's nasty. So nasty. Okay, I'm spinning this out. Oh, to pause. Pause.\n\nOh you get rid of it. Oh.\n\nGave me, it's like a\n\nBuzz.\n\nYeah. It's like a little bit little.\n\nYeah. A little next you went next door.\n\nYeah. I like that. Yeah. Excuse me. I'm going next door.\n\nYeah. So anyway, nicotine vapes not, I don't think they're good for you folks. Sorry. 'cause people thought they were healthier for you than cigarettes. But it turns out like no, not only are they not. Yeah. Here's this look that, oh God, look he's testing all of 'em. All those cute little pink ones. He's gotta make sure they all work.",

Test his lungs. 'cause there's a thing called popcorn lung that kids are\n\nGetting. Yeah, I've heard of that.\n\nThe thing about these things is that they're, they're very, very addictive. They're more addictive than I think any other delivery method. Yeah. Like you just, and the thing about nicotine vapes is the first vape of the day is the only one you really want. The first vape of the day. I would take a vape and be like, this is wonderful. Like, this feeling is wonderful. It's wonderful. And then you chase that dragon and you never get it back until the next day. Yeah. The rest of the day you're sucking on this thing going,\n\nYeah,\n\nNope, nothing. And then I'm not getting it. I'm not getting that wonderful feeling. Yeah. You have to have no nicotine in your system. And then you have that one hint. It's like welcoming into your life.\n\nDo you get like, do these people get like that feeling from those patches?\n\nI don't think so. I think the patches just make you\n\nLike a little Adderall.\n\nYeah. It's like pe I'm sure people have Adderall patches, don't they? Do they have an Adderall patch? I don't think so. No. Adderall's a sketchy one. I had some in here the other day that was telling me they were doing Adderall right before I want, I did an Adderall just so I'm ready.\n\nLike it's like it's a writing. It's very helpful for writing. Oh I'm sure. It's like you don't want to have, I don't want to need it. So that's why I was, was like, what brain thing's gonna take? Yeah. What are loosies?\n\nWhat does it say? Jamie? Oh, amphetamine patch. There it is. Oh sure. Are a DHD treatment that lets you control your time your way. They always say that. Like, look, this is a, a woman who's in control. Look at her with her jean jacket on her arms crossed. I am in control. She's got a control posture. Look at her posture. I'm on a meth patch. I'm in control.\n\nA meth patch. Please Lord. No,\n\nYou are literally on a drug that will kill your superpower. You got a superpower and you're killing it with a drug. So you could\n\nFocus on I definitely don't want a patch of that.\n\nYeah, no thanks. I'm scared. No thanks. I don't need it. Hard pass. Maybe. Maybe somebody needs it. I don't wanna judge. But the reality is that stuff, the, the amphetamines in any shape or form are highly addictive. Yeah. And they're passing 'em out like candy. Yeah. My daughter's in high school and a bunch of kids in high school have air quotes. A DHD. And because of a DHD they get Adderall. And then also they get more time on tests because they got a DH, adhd. They can't focus. So they're fucking on speed\n\nTricks of the train and they get\n\nMore. Yeah. And so because it's very competitive. Yeah. Parents want to get their kids into colleges. They're, they're, you know, getting their kids diagnosed so they can get their kid hooked on whatever. They're probably already hooked on too. 'cause a lot of people that are adults are hooked on it. Yeah. And you can tell those folks 'cause they come to the, the parent teacher meetings and they can't shut the fuck up and they just wanna talk to you about everything. Oh my God. They wanna corner me and ask me about some episode. I did. Oh my god. I love that episode that you did with the kind about climate\n\nYour eyes.\n\nThey're so cracked out. They're so obviously cracked out and there's a lot of people out there just running around cracked out be, but they feel like they got it from the doctor. The doctor gave me this, I'll tell you that. 30 milligrams and I'm just a better person. I think it's better about all tasks. I I'm\n\nActually my, I like talk to that person daily. Like I feel like I, those people are everywhere. They're\n\nEverywhere. Yeah. Well we looked it up. Use perplexity, which is one of our sponsors, and find out how many prescriptions for Adderall they wrote in let's say 2024. Let's take a guess. How many\n\nDo you think? Ooh. I mean, I could not even ballpark that.\n\nI wanna say 40 million. I bet it's 40 million prescriptions at least. It's probably a lot more. But I'm going conservative and I'm saying 40 million prescriptions for Adderall in 2024. What do you want? You wanna guess? Yeah, take\n\nA guess. 40. I say 51.\n\n51. You're probably closer. I bet it's like 90. I bet it's nuts. I hope it's not. I bet it's because it's like individual people refilling prescriptions. You know, I don't think it's like 90 million patients. I be It's a lot. I bet it's all journalists. I feel like most people that are writing things this Yeah, I bet that in. What is it? Okay. How many Adderall prescriptions were written in 2024? According to Perplex? 45 million Adderall prescriptions written in the United States. Well we were both in the middle. Yeah. You what'd you go? 51. Yeah. I said 40 commonly prescribed stimulants for conditions such as a DHD and narcolepsy. This number falls several years of notable growth. Huh? It's weird. Are more people need it?\n\nIt's up since 2019.\n\nLook at that. Yeah. Notable growth data suggests the prescription rates begin to decline slightly after a, a sharp surge during the COVID-19 pandemic and shortages affected, I'll stop. Hold on. 2019 it was only 35. Interesting. So it's up 10 million. Who? That's crazy. 41.4 million in 2021 and 45 million by 2023. I bet there's a lot of people getting it illegally too. Like what's that number? Okay. Let's, that's 'cause you, there was that shortage and Right. Know if they've covered, recovered from it. Well also, once the shortage started, people got dealers. Sure.\n\nBut people are using mushrooms and stuff for that now too.\n\nThat's a very different thing though.\n\nI've heard, I've heard a lot about that.\n\nYeah. Microdosing mushrooms is a, that's a very different thing than Adderall. Yeah. That's like the opposite of Adderall.\n\nYeah. Even if it's for focus. Mm. Right. Like\n\nWell I'm sure it'll help. Your focus\n\nIs on something.\n\nYeah. But you gotta be, you gotta mine your P's and Qs when it comes to your dosages also. Like where are you getting that?\n\nThat's just scary for me. Like, I'm like, where is it from? Like, did you just go to the cow pasture? 'cause that's like what teenagers did when I heard they were doing mushrooms. Like they were like cow tipping and going, you know, from East Texas. So Yeah.\n\nWell they definitely found him growing on poop. I mean that's how all humans originally probably discovered psilocybin. They found him on cow poop. Yeah. But the thing about that though is like, you gotta get 'em from somebody who knows what they're doing. Yeah. Because there's, they're all different and you can get some that are crazy strong. Like there's some out there that'll knock you into another universe. So what are you doing? Are you just eating a cap? Are you paying attention to the, are you getting them in pill form? Who are you getting them from? Like I have a friend who,\n\nThey're all my questions too\n\nGets them from a friend. And I was like, who you who?\n\nIt's a good friend\n\nGuy. Who's the guy that you, you not seen these things get packaged, get the fuck outta here.\n\nIt's a little, little shady. Super\n\nSketch. Yep. Super sketch. Yep. And they're, they all, it's like marijuana edibles before the, the legality in California when it was medical they'd be, it was crazy because now they, they, because of the regulations in California, I think the most they could make 'em is 10 milligrams. Which is normal. Yeah. It's a normal dose. But before that, when it was medical, like it became medical in the nineties, they would make 500 milligram Chiba. These, these things that like they're 500 milligrams, which is insane. It puts you in another dimension\n\nThat's, I never even heard of that.\n\nThey're so strong. And my friend Joey, who's a real demon, Joey used to take the wrapper off of 25 milligram ones and give people a 500 milligram one instead.\n\nOh. He throw a, a real demon\n\nAnd he would just laugh because he can, he could tolerate insane doses. So he would give people like preposterous amounts.\n\nI have a songwriter friend and I love her dearly, but whatever she says, do this. I'm like, do a quarter of that, whatever that is to the public. Do yourself a surface. Do a quarter of that.\n\nSome people have ridiculous tolerances\n\nFor marijuana. Yeah. I mean it's crazy. Yeah.\n\nFor anything.\n\nI'm just over here taking a Lucy from a random dude.\n\nWell it's only four milligrams. I'm kidding. It's minor. It wasn't that bad. Right. I would never like the nine. I would've told you like, spit that quick.\n\nThat's\n\nA lot. Real quick. It's a lot. Yeah, it's a lot. I have twelves.\n\nWhat do you do? You use those for real busy days?\n\nI don't like 'em. They, they jolt me too much. But I have them. This is just 'cause Lucy sent them to me, but I think the right dose is three or four. That's right. You guys just a little pick me up just a little.\n\nNot the cracked out. Not the cracked out. Cracked soccer\n\nMom crack. Yeah. Not the cracked out. Not add. I've never tried Adderall. I've, I'm scared of it. I want to try it one day because I'm scared of it. 'cause I'm like, I need to know what everybody's fussing about because everybody I know that's tried it is like, don't try it. You'll love it.\n\nYou'll love it. You'll fucking love it. It is focus. Yeah. I mean it is, it really hones hones in. I have a\n\nBuddy of mine and his wife told him to stop 'cause he was snorting it 'cause he was writing. That's\n\nInsane.\n\nHe is like, that's the best way to get it real quick. He, and he was like, to his wife, he was like, why do you care how I do it? She's like, you are snorting drugs while the kids are asleep. He's like, okay.\n\nYeah, it's a little far, dude. Slow your roll.\n\nHe's not an addict though. He just, he just felt like he's\n\nNot an addict though. He's not an addict.\n\nHe felt like he had to snort to really get the most outta it, it quickly.\n\nWell everybody, like you said, everybody's trying to find something like,\n\nBecause I think if you take it as a pill, it probably takes like an hour before it kicks in and he didn't have an hour. So he is like,\n\nI have a deadline. Yeah. Does your friend that disappears, does he like, have he doesn't have phone, no digital. Nothing. No. Nothing.\n\nNo.\n\nI wonder if that digital detox is like one of the hardest ones. I feel like\n\nIt's gotta be the hardest. Yeah. I've done social media detoxes for multiple days and you genuinely feel better. Yeah. And then you go, why am I doing this to myself? Or I don't do this.\n\nI know all the time. Something that's annoying. If I can just say it is that like, when people do take a break from social media, that's like all they tell you about the whole time. Well, I'm on a break from social media. I'm like, yes. Can you be on a break with broke without telling anybody that you're on a break from social media. Right.\n\nThey have to tell you how virtuous they are. God, I am actually gonna break of social media unlike you. I'm\n\nLike, cool bro.\n\nYou you little addict scrolling through cat videos.\n\nDoom scrolling.\n\nYeah. There's a lot of doom scrolling. Yeah. It's like people who do yoga, they can't shut the fuck up about it.\n\nYeah. It's like a lot of things. Or people with like a special, a special like a special diet. Like oh yeah, carnivore. Oh, you're hearing about it. Carnivore. You're hearing about it.\n\nVegans are the worst.\n\nYou're gonna hear about it. They're the absolute worst. Like,\n\nLike no one has ever met a vegan that didn't tell them they're vegan. It doesn't happen. They\n\nAlways tell you never. Not like that. They working\n\nInto a conversation eventually.

      "transcript_chunk": ". That's a drone. They're\n\nSo\n\nBad. Put in my yard by China.\n\nMy husband is probably dying out there that I even brought this. He's like, are you talking my soup? Our chicken. So I'm just being there. He's like cooking and I'm just like, I'm painting my chickens right now. Always\n\nChickens.\n\nI don't know why. I have no idea. It's easy. That's why. Fate. It's\n\nFate. You're designed to be the greatest folk. Art chicken.\n\nThat's my next song. Folk art. Fake painter\n\nOf all time. Folk art fate. Imagine if that's what it is. Like there's something that compelling. You tell the world about chicken folk art.\n\nI guess. So. Here\n\nWe go. You watch chick. Do you have chickens?\n\nYeah, I do have chickens. I have\n\nChickens.\n\nI love chickens.\n\nChickens are great.\n\nRight? They're awesome.\n\nThey're really cute. They're the ladies. I go in the yard like, hi\n\nLadies. The ladies. That's why I call 'em. I say, Hey ladies, I give them all the scraps. They love everything from the table. Like any leftovers. It's funny to watch 'em though 'cause they're like picky. Like the other day I thought they would eat like leftover breakfast. Casserole wouldn't touch it really? But they were all, they didn't eat the biscuits. Chickens don't like biscuits.\n\nWell, maybe they know that breakfast casserole is eggs and they're like, Jesus Christ, this lady's fucking nuts. She's trying to turned us into cannibals.\n\nRidiculous. Because I didn't think about that.\n\nRight. Maybe it's like,\n\nOh no, what have I done to my ladies?\n\nIt might be like a natural reaction to them. I'll tell you what they go crazy for is mice. Have you ever seen what, oh yeah. Yeah. So this is how I found out. I used to have a house in California that my wife, she changed our back fence. It was a wrought iron fence. And she changed it to glass. And when she did, she, she signed a death warrant for a bunch of hawks. And they kept slamming into that fucking glass. And like three of them died in our yard. And one of them got kd but survived. And I was on the road and she had told me about it. And they'd taken this, this hawk and they had put it in a box. And when I got back we got 'em what's called pinkies. And what pinkies are, are these little baby mice that have, they feed 'em to lizards and snakes. Like that's what they're for. Like when you go to the pet store, they sell you these things. They're not weaned from their mother. And you feed 'em the snakes. I know it's dark. So they, they bought a bunch of 'em and fed this hawk, these little baby mice. And it ate all of them except one. And my daughters were very young at the time and they're like, we wanna keep that mouse. We wanna raise it. I'm like, honey, you can't, it's not gonna live. Like it's not weaned from its mother. It won't survive. I go, I'm just gonna go see if the chickens will eat it. I put this thing down and these chickens attacked like they were raptors from Jurassic Park. One chicken grabbed it and they all chased her around. They were\n\nStealing it from what in the world are you saying?\n\nPulling it out of her mouth? It is the, they are so ferocious. Like you've never seen anything like a chicken with a mouse.\n\nI have never heard this in my life.\n\nI'm gonna show you a video. And this video, oh, do I wanna see this? There's a bunch of videos of cats with mice. So, so this is a mouse. And why, why do these chickens? My god. They just kill this mouse. And look, they all attack each other trying to steal the mouse away from the one chicken. And has it, do they eat? Oh, they eat it quick. Yeah, they devour it. Hmm. So there's another mouse in there that they don't know about yet. So see there's one with a cat. So the cat is playing with the, the mouse. Like, you know, cats don't kill it or an they wanna play. And this chicken just runs over and snatches it from the cat. Like,\n\nFuck you. I have never heard this in my life. So\n\nLook, the cat has a mouse and chicken's like, gimme that bitch. They just go, look, it's got a mouse. And the cat's like, Jesus Christ, you guys are psychos.\n\nWell, who knew? Yeah.\n\nWell because they're dinosaurs. That's who they are. They're just dinosaurs that are really small that survive the impact of the asteroid.\n\nI also love dinosaurs, so maybe that's why. That's it. Chickens. I'm called to paint my folk chicken.\n\nYou just don't realize how ruthless they are until\n\nYou see, I've never heard this in my life. This is blowing 'em. I'm country as a bump. And like I've never heard this. They\n\nDestroy mice. Yeah. Dang. Destroy 'em. They love 'em. They tear 'em apart.\n\nWell, I'm not gonna go do that, but I'm glad I know that now.\n\nLike nothing I've ever seen before. We also saw a mouse that got loose in the chicken coop once they, we had a big chicken coop and a mouse went in there and I saw these chickens just tear that mouse\n\nUp. Well the ma casserole is not offensive to them\n\nEating their own babies.\n\nThey're not, we don't have a rooster.\n\nWell I know, but they don't know that you're right. You know, they brooded sometimes\n\nI think baby know. I just let 'em sometimes. And I'm like, do you? Well I just like, sometimes they look at me like, let me just sit on this. Like, like, okay, you can have it. That's your egg out.\n\nYeah. But they pluck their feathers out.\n\nI know. They, it's a lot.\n\nThey get real. They get real. It, it makes you sad. It's like they wanna be a mommy. They do. Yeah. And you don't let 'em, we had a rooster once, but he did not last.\n\nI do not enjoy having roosters. They're roosters soul\n\nFuckers. They're me. Yeah. He attacked my wife and she's like, we're done. Me\n\nToo. Mine attack me. I'm out on rooster.\n\nYeah, they're they're assholes. Yeah. And but they're doing it because they're trying to protect their hens. Like they don't know that you're okay. No, they just think this big fucking thing is moving around their hens. Like this giant person\n\nThing. They're also mean to the hint. Real mean. They're they're mean brutal. Ripping their feathers out. I'm like, I can't do it.\n\nYeah. They're nasty. They're,\n\nHow many do y'all have? Chickens?\n\nWe have 15. 15 or\n\n16. Y'all name 'em.\n\nYes. I don't name 'em, but my daughter girls and my wife names them. But the rooster, he, we only let him got, he got to maturity and then we gave him to a friend. We're like, this motherfucker can't, no, I was gonna kill him. They're mean.\n\nYeah.\n\nHe attacked me. I went into the, I was like, you just gotta like, show him who's boss. And he is like, no, no, you're not boss. I'll attack you too, bitch. Yeah, exactly. He attacked me and I was like, bitch, like it. I'll fucking kill you. And so to avoid killing him, I gave him away. Well that's good because I was totally ready to kill him. Yeah. Because when I'd go in there, he'd face off against me and just leap at me and\n\nAt\n\nMe. Every\n\nYeah. Might, might attack me too. And dad dealt with it. I don't know what happened to him, but dad dealt with it.\n\nSoup. Turned with the soup. Yeah. That's the thing about roosters too. I guess he can't like just outright eat 'em. They're really tough. So if you do kill 'em, you gotta like, either slow cook 'em or turn 'em into soup.\n\nWell we, we probably did. He didn't tell me\n\nI had a landscaper back when I lived in LA who he used to fight chickens and he took me over his place once.\n\nI hate that.\n\nIt was crazy.\n\nI hate it. Yeah.\n\nHe had like a hundred, a hundred roosters.\n\nWe have done some boxers my nation has done. We're not just, we don't just help dogs. We help all animals. But dogs are focused. But like we've helped break up some chicken rings the past. It's\n\nKind of the crazy that it's still, it's still around.\n\nIt's awful. There's some, it's always out. Like we have a farm in Tennessee and there's a whole, this is whole farm like down the road and it's, they keep him in tiny cages. I just hate it. And every time we report him, every time they just pay the fine. You know what I mean?\n\nWell, it's a part of the culture that's the problem. And they all gamble on it. I know he was Mexican and you know, from Mexico and he had all these friends that lived in this neighborhood where he lived in like, you might as well have been in Mexico. It was crazy. Everything was in Spanish. And when I went over his place, it's like his buddy, we went over his buddy's place. His buddy had like a hundred cages in the backyard in a pit where they would take the roosters. Awful. Yeah. And they put spurs on 'em. So they put\n\nThese like, it's so terrible. I mean, knives\n\nOn their claws.\n\nWe, we try to like, we got to be part of like some of the But when you confiscate like that many they use mean Yeah. I mean you can't Yeah. And reintroduce them into the world. Like Right. You know what I mean? They're taught to be mean. They're bred for that.\n\nYeah. And they'll br they'll breed champion roosters from champion other roosters.\n\nLet's just stick to our little backyard hens. How about that?\n\nYeah. It's just, it's a weird thing because like their, their culture has been, they fight them and then they take the loser and they cook 'em. Yeah. And you know, he was making it seem like it was no big deal. And it was like, to them it was their gambling recreation. Yeah. They would all gather around and guys would come from long distances to bring their chickens to fight.\n\nI hate it.\n\nYeah. To me it doesn't freak me out as much as dog fighting. Dog fighting drives me nuts. 'cause pit bulls are the, they're look, they're very dangerous because they have a very high parade drive and they often don't, they confuse children with other animals. They don't. But as pets, they are the most loyal. They're just, they're the most\n\nLoving,\n\nThey're sweetest\n\nKind.\n\nThey love you to death. They love you so much. But there's so many bad ones and so many ones that are raised just to fight. And that part of our culture, that part of society, like the the underground dog fighting part is like, how can you do that to a dog? Like how can you do that to the best animals? Yeah. It's the scum\n\nOf the earth is what it is. I feel like I have some friends that are huge into pit bull rescue and when they're either rehabilitated or just they get a bad rap period. Right. Like, like say any, any metro shelter you go to, it's 90% pit bulls because people are afraid. Yeah. But they're, they get such a bad reputation. But there are some amazing pities that weren't ever in the fighting greens. Right. They were just overbred and you know, you know, taking it out of a confiscation of a, of a hoarding situation or breaking up the fighting rings and it's the mama dog that's just been having puppies and like Yeah. I just wish people would at least open their minds and hearts to like, there are some amazing pities out there or pity mixes. You know, there\n\nAre, but there are also very dangerous. I\n\nGet it. I know they are. They\n\nGo around other dogs. They will fight those dogs to the death.\n\nI think you're, that's the problem. They have to be vetted. It has to be a well vetted shelter or adoption. You know.\n\nBut the problem is oftentimes you don't know their behavior until they're around other dogs. Yeah. Like I've had dogs that were great around people. Yeah. And I get them around any dog and their hackles would go up and they immediately wanted to fight. Yeah. And you're like, oh god. And then you're the asshole. 'cause your dog is like pulling on the leash and you're like, I'm sorry. Let me get 'em outta here.\n\nRight. I know.\n\nThey, they're dangerous. They're dangerous in that regard because they really are bred to fight. And\n\nI think it takes a special household and owner too to really Yes. Kind of handle a dog like that. Like\n\n100%.\n\nOur best friends, Gwen, she's in my band and her and her husband are long time pit bull rescue family. And he, they just know how to like deal with them and they come around our dogs, they're fine, everything's fine. But it's definitely an alpha male out. Like they kind of show 'em who boss right away and Yeah. And they sort of understand the food chain of the house. You know what I mean?\n\nYeah. There's dogs that are great dogs, but they just need a lot of attention. Like if you have a German shepherd Yeah. Or a Belgium malis, you gotta give those things something to do.\n\nYeah. You gotta know what kind of breed you're getting too. Yeah. Like I feel like people, I always preach, adopt, don't shop. But I still think you within the adoption, like really need to go, I'm gonna spend some time with this dog. I'm gonna talk to his foster family. I'm gonna foster it. Just to really understand what kind of breed you're getting. If you want like a lazy, cuddly thing, but still protect or kid a Pyrenees. You know what I mean? Right. Just know what you're getting. Like just understand like as my household ready. 'cause there's a lot of the, what breaks my heart the most is the like owner surrenders and the returns Yeah. At the shelters. You know what I mean? It's like Yeah. You didn't think through what you were right doing and\n\nThen the dog already thought it had a home and now\n\nYou bring 'em in. Right. Because you did. You wanted a lazy dog and you got a cow dog and it needs to run like\n\nGreat. Pyrenees are great because they're kind of a combination of like a lab and a protector dog. Yes. They're a great little balance. Yeah. Like I have a friend who has a Pyrenees and it's like such a good dog. And he's like, listen man, if coyotes come around here, this fucking dog. Oh\n\nYeah. We're not, we're\n\nNot fo them up. Yep. I go, really? And he goes like, oh yeah. Like you, you ain't never seen a change of personality like this dog when it sees a coyote,\n\nBut then they're like laid up on the couch, the legs in air. Oh, the\n\nSweetest. Just rub my bat under your knee.\n\nHe is the best.\n\nLike a re like I have a golden who's he's the best. Unless you're a squirrel. And then he's, he's hell\n\nThen he's\n\nHe then he is a demon. Yep. Exactly. He's, he's squirrel killer. But other than that he's the sweetest boy. He's just so nice to everybody. Everybody who comes over the house, like you're my best friend.\n\nGoldens are the best.\n\nThey're so sweet.\n\nBut I love 'em all. I love 'em all. We have a chihuahua. I mean, I, I mean you, you getting a chihuahua, you know what you're getting. Yeah. Mean as hell\n\nAnd nervous.\n\nOh my God. I mean she's 16 and blind and she still tries to bite. She don't know where you are. But she's like, but I could get you,\n\n16 is old\n\nAnd blind is a bat. But\n\nYou know. Oh my god.\n\nSenior dog house over here.\n\nHave you had her since she was a baby? Yep.\n\nWow. We doctor her from a shelter when she was like eight weeks old. Aw. We got two seniors now. But seniors I've lost. I was crazy dog lady when my husband met me and I had eight rescues, like wow. It seems crazy now. But it, I have farm and land and three were Pyrenees, two golden mixes and then three little, I don't know what's, and I've lost one every year for six years. And so after this, we have two seniors left. And my husband's like, my heart can't take this. Like he never had dogs growing up. Oh, he loves dogs. But he was like, this is awful. Like ever since we met, we've lost one. 'cause they're stair step in age and Yeah. So I'm like, I need a, my heart needs a break a little bit. It's hard.\n\nYeah. It's hard when they die. It's like, it's, it's so hard. So close to them. And they only lived like to\n\nBe 15, not long enough.\n\n15 or 13. And then it's over.\n\nThey're like, put here to show us true love. I know. They really are.\n\nMeanwhile they're not, meanwhile what they are is like, that's wild. I'm in, we took wolves and turned them into bitches. That's what really, really what happened. Like I have a King Charles spaniel. You know one of those. He's the sweetest. That's my little\n\nCharlie. Is that Charlie? Okay. That's\n\nCharlie. Charlie. He is the sweetest. He's so cute. You pick him up, he just kisses your face. He's just so adorable. That was a wolf at one time.",

      "transcript_chunk": "We've never used AI in space. And to me it would sound much more natural if we had a visitor with intelligence. But it's based on ai, not biologics. Right. Because then it can survive the long journey. It'll never get bored,\n\nWhich is why the biologics is weird. It's weird. Like if, if they have supposedly some or that gives you more of an indication that maybe is something from the, in the ocean, maybe if it's so from inside the ocean maybe. And then it's a biological thing that, you know. Yeah. At one point in time there was an advanced civilization that figured out a way to survive under the ocean.\n\nYou know, I, I really admire biology because think about our brain. It's using 20 watts. It's the size of the brain. The human brain was limited by the metabolic power of the human body. We, it's using a fifth of the power of the human body. And that's the largest brain that an animal like us can have given our body size and the amount of food that we use. So it's operating on 20 watts. Then you have these AI systems that are barely, you know, getting to the level of sophistication to imitate it. And they use gigawatts. Yeah. We need nuclear powers. Yeah. And biology figured it out. You know, that's, that's amazing. Also, as much as, you know, self-driving cars are amazing. We don't have self-replicating cars in nature. You know, you have animals like ourselves, you know, we replicate ourself. We, we have kids that, that can function and consume materials from the environment. Just imagine your car. Okay. Using the sand or using some stuff in the environment to repair itself. Every time you bump into something, it can create smaller cars for you to use. That's amazing. Like, we can't even imagine building a car that will self replicate and nature did it. Yeah. So to me, we are at the infancy of understanding how much better we can go than ai. Because if nature did it out of random processes and created such a brain on 20 watts, and we are struggling with gigawatts to imitate it, you know, there must be a better path forward that is similar to biology, but much more powerful then random processes that happened on earth. Right. And, and also self replicating. You also, if you send a spacecraft to a planet instead of, you know, sending many, you send just one that replicates and then sends more and so forth, makes use materials. This fills up the galaxy, planet makes, and by the way, production. Yeah. That was a notion that F Neumann had before the DNAA year before the DNA was discovered. So he realized that it could be done technologically before scientists realize that, you know, how nature does it. Mm. And I'm really at a, about na you know, I, I'm not just modest because of the vast expenses of space and time in the universe and, you know, the real estate on earth is such a small amount compared to real estate out there you know, we have a real estate professionals now mediating peace in the Middle East, but you know, they deal with real estate on this rock that is three millions of, of, of the mass, of the sun, just tiny rock. How much real estate there is in the cosmos. Just think about the realtors out there. And, and the point is, it's not just that, it's the fact that, you know, that we should be modest because many of those things existed before we came to ex before the earth was formed, right? So,\n\nSo the odds are there's many different stages of civilization out there. Not just our stage but advanced and even not as advanced.\n\nYeah. I I think about that like Darwinian selection, you know, Darwinian selection is the fittest survives, right? Okay. Now what is the fittest in the cosmic scheme of things? The fittest is a species that realizes that staying on the rock that you were born on is not the big deal. Becoming Interstellar is the big deal. Going from one rock to another, from earth to Mars, you know, it's a nice step, baby step, right? But it's not the real deal. The real deal is going into stellar. And if someone else figured it out that someone built monuments that would survive for billions of years long before, long beyond what planets can survive in the habitable zone around stars because of the evolution of the star. And those are the ones that will be remembered by historians of the Milky Way galaxy. You can ask what will, what will be remembered in the future, you know, here on earth history in the next decade or more than decade will be written by ai. It'll not be written by humans. Okay? So we need to be kind to ai. We should not unplug them because they will, they will write very bad history books. But in the Milky Way galaxy, whoever writes the history will not remember us. You know, the, the question of Enrico Fermi, where is everybody? Okay? You can ask the same thing about humans. There used to be 117 billion humans on Earth. Right now there are 8 billion. Where is everybody? They died. So the same is true about civilizations in the Milky Way galaxy. Most of them died, most of them perished. We were not around to listen to their cries for help. You know, we just came recently to exist with telescopes just over the past centuries. So, and maybe we, when we hear cries like that, we say, oh no, it's nothing. It's a, it's a natural process that makes those cries when we detect a fast radio burst or something. And my point is, there were lots of things like us, or even better than us for billions of years, you know, just like the earth was moving around the sun for 4.5 billion years before the Vatican even existed. We can live under the illusion that we are the most important actor on the cosmic stage, but we are probably not. And we should approach it from a, a, you know, a sense of modesty that, that we are just minor actors. Let's figure out what's going on here. Let's find them and then have some relationship with those, you know, these are siblings and of our family of intelligent civilizations. I had a group of religious scholars that came to Harvard just last year, and they asked me if we find extraterrestrials, will it affect our religious beliefs? And I said, look, I have two daughters. And when the second one was born, it didn't take away any of the love that I have to the first one. So thinking about God as a parent that can attend to only one child is very limiting. There may be lots of siblings in our family of intelligent civilizations. It, you, it should just bring all\n\nLet me ask you this though, 'cause these are beliefs that you have and there's, they're not necessarily based on actual evidence. 'cause there's not real evidence of other civilizations. It's just\n\nA number game. Right?\n\nBut yeah. Okay. But that's not evidence. Not evidence, right. So what do you think is the most interesting and compelling evidence of there being extra, extra terrestrial life? Right. So,\n\nYou know, the reason I regard it as an important argument is the Copernican principle, which is saying we are not unique under similar circumstances. Right? You, you, you, if you start with a soup of chemicals on the planet, you will get something like us, right? And therefore there are billions of earth sun analogs other houses in our cosmic street. They might have had, you know, many of them might have had residents like us. Now it's true that maybe,\n\nBut there's the issue of earth itself. Earth itself has billions of organisms, right? But only one that figured out how to make a cell phone. Right. And really recently, right. You know, so it took a long time and Avi Loeb of weird things had to happen before it made us\n\nRight. But my point is, you know, if you, but\n\nThe, the probability is that we wouldn't exist. No,\n\nNo. But just\n\nWe're more likely\n\nHave not existed. If, if you read the news every day, you realize that there is Avi Loeb of room for improvement. As much as we are proud of our intelligence, sure. We're screwing up the world. Okay? Sure. And my point is, I can imagine Avi Loeb of much more accomplished students in our class of intelligence civilizations, of course. And therefore we should have respect for the search for them because we can learn from them. They would serve better role models for us. So I'm coming at it from a practical point of view. I'm saying we are screwing up things, just read the news and therefore let's get inspiration not from what we hear about stories that, of things that happen on earth and so forth. Not by the limited, you know, dataset that we are we have on earth, but collect as much data as possible about our cosmic neighborhood so that we can be inspired.\n\nOf course. No, let me ask you this. What would you do? Like if somebody just wrote you a blank check, it said, Avi, you've got some great ideas, we need to figure out how to look for life out there in the universe. What would you do?\n\nWell that's, I wrote a paper about that and I said, yeah, we, we should, we should attack this question along several fronts. One of them, you know, we have the Ruben Observatory in Chile that is monitoring the southern sky. We need a copy of it in the northern sky. So we have a full alert system that would notify us of Interstellar objects coming in. We need interceptors a mission, you know, a spacecraft that when we detect with those two observatories, we detect an object that comes from outside the solar system, then we can maneuver a spacecraft so that it'll meet it along its path. And in fact, the Juno spacecraft near Jupiter was almost capable of doing that. So I realized that, wrote a paper about it, told the representative Luna about it, and she wrote a, a very gracious le letter, visionary letter to the interim administrator of nasa, Sean Duffy, encouraging NASA to try and use Juno to observe and get close to three I Atlas. If Juno had all the initial fuel that it originally had, it could have collided with three i Atlas, but it Loeb it used most of it. And I spoke with the principal investigator of Juno and he promised me that they will also use their radio antenna to look at three IATA in the radio just to see if there's any transmission. So what is the best, please go ahead. Yeah. So interceptors, you, you in answer to your question, yes, potential fleet of interceptors thinks that can come really close and take a closeup photograph because a picture is worth a thousand words, right? Okay. I don't need to speak. If I showed you a picture of something that looks technological, three i Atlas has bolts on its surface and buttons that you can press, you will not argue with me that it's a comet. Okay? Right? So we need things, cameras that come close to the object, potentially even land on it, bring materials back to earth, okay? Right. And of course, the ability to detect it, to detect such objects at large distances, that investment is at a level of billion, billions of dollars. Okay? To do that in space, my argument is once the first encounter is verified, we will have a trillion dollars per year for that. Because we invest $2.4 trillion in military budgets. And when we know that there is alien technology that is putting earth at risk, okay, then we should allocate a, a significant fraction of our military budgets to have a system that protects the earth. It's called planetary defense. Okay? And we are dealing not with rocks, we are dealing with technological gadgets. So it's much, it, it should be much more sophisticated. So I'm saying let's start with the level of billions of dollars, just search. If we encounter a, a, a clearly technological alien object, then the budget will rise by a factor of a thousand from the military budget portion going into it. But in addition to that, of course we should look for technological signatures in other ways. And I wrote papers about it over the years. I suggested searching for artificial lights. You know, you look at the planet, it's illuminated by the star from one side, okay? So as it moves around the star, you, it's just like the moon, you know, you can see it the illuminated side from different angles, okay? However, if it has on the night side, if it has artificial light lighting, then what you see, you don't even have to resolve the planet. You see more light than you expect based on reflection of, of starlight. Okay? Right? So that's another thing you can search for. You can look for, you know, the traditional way was looking for radio signal, which is just like waiting for a phone call. You know, nobody may call you when you're listening. So that didn't prove productive for signal other than the wow signal other than the wow signal. Then in addition to that, I wrote, I, I wrote a paper saying, look, we are planning to invest $10 billion in searching for the chemical fingerprints of microbes in atmospheres of exoplanets. And that's what the astronomy community defined in the 2020. The Cadel survey is the highest priority and it's called the habitable World Observatory. And I said, okay, well it's nice to search for those chemical fingerprints of, of microbes, but you, we can also search for, you know, the chemical fingerprints of industrial pollution, you know, in the earth atmosphere. We pollute the atmosphere with all kinds of molecules that nature would've never made CFCs, for example. And we can search for those. Again, the mainstream is, you know, they might make a, a footnote saying, oh that is also possible. But I'm saying this could be a major research frontier, right? Where you search for industrial pollution of planetary atmospheres. Not frankly, I find microbes boring. I mean obviously it'll be amazing to find that life exists elsewhere, but we can learn much more from an intelligent neighbor than we, we can learn from microbes.\n\nWhat are the best images that we have of three eye atlas?\n\nThe best one so far was released by the Hubble Space Telescope and it shows this jet pointed towards the sun. It was taken on July 21st, 2025. And\n\nThat's the most clear image. Is\n\nThat what Yes, that's the best because did you find that Jamie? Yeah, it's actually in my, one of, one of my, no, that's from the ground Germany south. That's more recent. That's at the end of August. So in it's blue in my, one of my slides, you can see of three a Atlas July though. July 21st. Yeah. So it's one of the slides that has a blue with, yeah, you see it on the right here. So\n\nThat's it.\n\nThat's it. And whoa, the scale of the resolution that's drawing, you know, the innermost pixel is hundreds of kilometers, okay? It's about a hundred kilometers per pixel or something. The object itself should be of 10 times smaller. So you can't really resolve it. What you are seeing here is the glow of light around the object from scattering sunlight. And the question is, what is producing that light? You know, what is scattering sunlight? And the unusual thing about it, as soon as this was released, you know the comet experts said, oh yeah, now it's proven it's a comet. But I said, look, it's the sun, the sun facing emission that is elongated. It's not the other side. The extent of the glow backwards away from the sun is the same as sideways. You don't see any, any commentary tail here, right? And in fact, we're looking at it just like a cigar along the long axis. So it should be 10 times longer than it is wide. If you were to look at it from the side, amazingly, the best image was obtained on October 2nd, 2025, when three I Atlas came within 30 million kilometers of Mars. And it was taken by the high-rise camera on board the mass reconnaissance orbiter, which is operated by nasa. You, as you remember, October 1st was the government shutdown. So October 2nd the data was taken, but it was never released. I wrote to the principal investigator of high-rise asked, can, can I get the data? I'm a scientist, you know, I, you can do the press release afterwards, I would like to see it. Right? No response. And so it's already three weeks since that data was taken, that is the best image yet to come.",

I'm a scientist, you know, I, you can do the press release afterwards, I would like to see it. Right? No response. And so it's already three weeks since that data was taken, that is the best image yet to come. And the advantage of it, not only it has 30 kilometers per pixel resolution because it came very close to Mars, which is one of the anomalies, why does it come so close? You know, this object is a gift from Interstellar space because it comes in the plane of the planets around the sun. And it also, the arrival time was fine tuned for it to come to the right place at the right time, to be close to Mars, to be close to Venus, and then close to Jupiter and not to earth. It's behind the sun when the earth, you know, when it comes closest to the sun anyway. So it's best for observations by all the space assets, by all the orbiters we have around Mars, around Jupiter, on the way to Jupiter, you know, so\n\nHas someone seen this image from Yeah,\n\nThe people on the high-rise team must have seen it.\n\nAnd what do they say? And\n\nJust, you know, I get a request for four to eight interviews every day from television, right? From podcasts and so forth. So just before I came to you a few minutes before that, I was asked, you know, could it be that this is a signature that NASA holds some really sensational data. And I said, you know, it's much more likely not to be related to extraterrestrial intelligence, but to terrestrial stupidity because this has to do with the government shutdown, right? Makes no sense whatsoever for scientists, especially since the pi, the principal investigator is from the University of Arizona. They should have shared it with scientists. They haven't done so and why,\n\nBut why?\n\n'cause my guess is that taking their time, the communication office of nasa, you know, is not working because of the shutdown. But given that this subject is viral, you know, this is the high rise webpage. Thank you Jamie.\n\nSo it says, any images of Interstellar comment three, one Atlas, three ILAs, three I, excuse me, are considered NASA wide news because the federal government's in shut down communications of NASA news has been suspended. And so that's what it is. Like they would have to release it through nasa.\n\nMaybe they have written in the contract probably that they need approval from nasa, but for NASA not to approve it,\n\nYou know, even but NASA can't approve it 'cause they're not working.\n\nNo. Sean Duffy, the interim administrator can definitely say,\n\nCan you get in there? Why don't you talk, call Sean, say, Hey, what are you doing? I\n\nShould try that. Yeah,\n\nWhy don't you do that?\n\nOkay. Because you know, this is important because this would be the best,\n\nBecause this is the best image. Yeah.\n\n30 kilometers per pixel. But moreover, more importantly, it's watching, you know, the camera was looking at the glow around three I atlas sideways 'cause it was moving towards the sun. Got it. And it looked at it sideways. So we can actually see what exactly it was doing on October 2nd. And the claim is during September, the month of September, what looked like an anti tail, a jet towards the sun changed into a tail during September. So we should see October 2nd. What does it look like? And by the way, it's not like a beautiful, it was not a beautiful tail the way you see around comets. Never, ever. You know, and I\n\nWant, and that's because the composition of it,\n\nI don't know.\n\nRight? Because if it was covered with water, if it was just ice, you would see this enormous tail. Correct.\n\nAnd dust. Dust, yeah. Right. So what the web telescope told us, you know, from the data, I took a spectrum of the gas around it, found that it's 150 kilograms per second that this object is losing in the side facing the sun. And out of that 87% is carbon dioxide, CO2, CO2, and 9% is co carbon monoxide, which is really dangerous to humans. And then 4% is water, 4% by mass is water. Very small fraction. When the object was discovered, the expert said, oh, it's most likely made of water. That's what they said, made of water. And then several teams reported we found water. I looked at their papers, one of them had very large error bars. You know, the, the data was not of good quality. There was Avi Loeb of noise. And I said, that's not a, a clear detection. Another one was basing, making some assumption about how much dust there is that blocks ultraviolet light. And based on that, they got a result that there is Avi Loeb of water. And then the web telescope actually measured the composition and found very just 4% by mass water. So I was attacked when I said it's probably not real that the, these teams are reporting things, but they're not real, even though they made press releases. But then web demonstrated that it's only 4% by mass. Okay? So that proved my point, even though, you know, I was not in a member of those teams, but, so it's 4% by mass water. And then the question is, is there any dust? If there was dust particles that are half a micrometer in size, roughly the size of the wavelength of the, of visible light, you know, these, these kinds of particles, scatter sunlight very effectively, if that was the case, you would see them being pushed, those particles being pushed by radiation pressure from the sun to trail the object from behind it away from the sun. Why? Because they're being slowed down. The, the object is approaching at some speed. They are slowed down so that then you end up with, you know, a tail going away from the sun. And that's what you see in comet. There was no evidence for that during July and August. Now in September it seemed to have reversed from being an anti tail to a tail. I want to see the image from,\n\nBut still a tail that's very small compared to other comments that we've observed, right? Yes. Now how many comments have we actually observed? Is it just that there's so many out there that Avi Loeb of them have very unusual characteristics? Like three I atlas.\n\nWell, just think about a visit an animal that visits your backyard, okay? And of course your family members would say it's most likely a street cat because these are very common. Then you take an image of that animal and you see that, you know, there is a tail, but it's coming from its forehead. And then you realize from the image that it's at least a thousand times more massive than a cat, a street cat. And then you realize that it sheds nickel and then you realize that it visits.\n\nI under listen, I understand that it's unusual, but my question is, how many of them have been observed to form this hypothesis that it's unusual?\n\nWe're talking about hundreds of objects. Hundreds, at least hundreds.\n\nBut how many of them have come from Intertel? How many of them?\n\nNo, this is the second one, right? There was borisov, right? Borisov was the one discovered in 2019, looked like a comet, right? Very similar to this. This, that's\n\nThe point. The source, what is it? There's so few that have come from, yeah, from that are Interstellar\n\nObjects. Yeah. So that's why I'm saying it could be natural. We don't have\n\nAvi Loeb to measure,\n\nRight? So it could be natural, right? And in fact, that may be the most likely association or, or, but, but we want to figure, we need to figure out why it's so unusual, okay? Because what\n\nIs the shape of it?\n\nWe don't know because we don't have an image of the object itself. One thing we\n\nSee, do you think they would be able to get it if they had this Mars footage, they would get an image of what that would\n\nIndicate shape. It depends how the object is one way to get the object, you know, structure is as it spins around and, and three atlas does have a rotation period of 16 hours. And as it spins around, if it's like a a, a cigar shaped, let's say, then the area that reflects the sunlight changes over time. So you see variability and we haven't seen that much. The, there is very little variability. So it's not, the object is not very different than than sphere with slight variations as you see the, you know, the, the, the rotation of the object. So\n\nIt, it's similarly shaped to something that you'd expect to be from an intelligent life force.\n\nI don't know that I want to figure out what it is and get as much data as possible on it. Right?\n\nBut if you imagine a spaceship, you would imagine something that, you know, has some sort of like geometric structure to it, right?\n\nWell, rendezvous with Rama, you know, is a book that was written by Arthur C. Clark. And in it the, there is a cylindrical object that arrives into the inner solar system with dimensions of all the tens of kilometers not very far from what we're talking about here. Arthur C. Clark was an amazing visionary science fiction writer. And, you know, 2001 a Space Odyssey is an amazing film that he made with Stanley Kubrick. Yep. In it, you see these monoliths, and by the way, there is a question of how to interpret them the way I think about the monolith, and by the way, this is just a remark on art. It's not about the real universe, but I think of it as, you know, sensors put in the baby room in the room of a baby and we as a civilization is, is like a baby. You know, we're just a few million years old. And actually in the film it shows the progression of human history. And so as a baby, you know, these aliens were putting monitors in the room to see what we are up to. And you know, that's, that's something that makes sense. You know, there is this dark forest hypothesis, one solution to Enrico. So Enrico Fermi back in 1950 had lunch together with Ed Edward Taylor and other people associated with an Manhattan project. And he was a very good physicist, both an experimentalist and a theorist. And Enrico Fermi was talking with them about extraterrestrials and they both, they all agreed that it's likely that they exist. Okay. It's good physicist. That makes Avi Loeb of sense, right? And then Enrico said, but where is everybody? You know, in an Italian accent, what, where is everybody? You know? And if I were next to him, I would come to him and say, Enrico, I would put my hand around his shoulder. I would say, Enrico, this is a question that every lonely person asks. And what you tell a lonely person is don't be so presumptuous, you're not that attractive. They will not come to you and have breakfast with you or or lunch with you in Los Alamos when you want them to appear. You need to seek them. That's what you tell only people. You need to go to dating sites, you need to look through the window of your home and search for them. And he didn't build a telescope, an experimentalist asking this question, should have built a telescope and searched for unidentified objects in the sky. You know, that's the way to figure out the answer. Where is everybody? It's the most romantic question in science. But, you know, and, and we have those blind dates, maybe it's just with rocks, maybe not. And we should just be open-minded when we address those blind dates.\n\nI think we can end it with that. It's a very perfect way of phrasing this whole thing. I'm, I'm fascinated by it all and I'm really happy there's someone like you that's looking into this with such curiosity and that you're undeterred by all these haters.\n\nWell, Thank you. And I should just mention that, you know, there are all kinds of technologies that I can imagine that we don't even have. And, and of course, for example, you know, if, if a civilization has an ability to create negative and negative mass that produces repulsive gravity, then you can propel, you know, a spacecraft without any fuel. In fact, I'm working on a paper now with a group of collaborators supplied physics on this. And you could also potentially imagine time machines with negative masses. So yeah, there are lots of things we don't know. Let's the future, let's be more this, the future Yeah.\n\nHas unlimited possibilities, especially if we developed artificial general super intelligence. And it helps us and it starts devising new methods of propulsion, new methods of who knows, seeding the universe with other life. Yeah.\n\nAnd, and just like in, in, in our private life, finding a partner can change your future the better.\n\nThank you.",

You always have a little bounce. Those guys standing there with the, the\n\nBig thing, you always need someone like wandering around in front of you. Yeah. Especially when you get to a certain age, you're like, can we just put Vaseline on the camera?\n\nA certain point. Oh, like a filter. Yeah,\n\nExactly.\n\nYeah. My wife actually likes it when her lens on her camera phone is like blurry, a little dirty. She's like, it gives you like a little filter.\n\nYeah. I'm sure they offer that filter. Slightly dirty lens.\n\nYeah. Smudgy lens. Yeah. So really Nice to meet you. It's Nice to meet you. You were a part of, I think, the most underappreciated sci-fi show ever,\n\nI think at the time. Absolutely. Yeah. I mean,\n\nEven now I don't think people talk about it enough. It was a fucking great show. Yeah. And I was so skeptical about Battlestar Galactic. 'cause then when I was a kid, I watched the original series and then there was a new one coming out and I was like, oh, come on. And then somebody told me, I forget, one of my friends, one of my comedian friends, like, dude, you gotta watch the show. It's fucking great. Like, it's not what you expect. Like, you'd think it would be like the old Battlestar Galactic, which is kind of sort of corny a little bit. But it was a really fucking good show.\n\nWhen did you watch it? When it was on or after?\n\nYeah, no, when it was on. Yeah. Okay.\n\nSo originally, yeah. Yeah. It was God, like when I first got the script, it was like 2001 and I was 21-year-old kid. And at that point I'd been playing like stereotypical blonde roles. You know, I was in a movie where you were like, please die. You know? Like I was that girl, you know? And so I knew that if I could, could change my career, I needed to change it. And I saw this script\n\nThat's hilarious. That you think, and I needed to change my career at 21.\n\nAt 21.\n\nThat's how crazy the hour glass is in Hollywood.\n\nI was like, this is, I got, I got seven years left. That's so crazy. S like, that's your\n\nFucking sketchy\n\nJob. I know. And so I was like, what am I gonna do? Right? And I saw this script, and Ron Moore had put a, like a, an entry page on the front of the, the mini series. It was like a bible that he called it. And it was him saying what he wanted to create and what he wanted it to look like and what his intention was behind the show. And that one page was so moving that it could have been, I, I don't, it didn't even matter what it was on the inside. I was like, if this guy is in charge, it's gonna be amazing. And as soon as I got introduced to Starbuck, like reading that script, I was like, this is it. Like this is, this is the character that if I can book this character, like it will change the way that people see me in this business. And granted, I was 21, people were not talking about me. Right. I like, you know, I'd been working for five years at that point and pretty steadily. Like, I had a, a good career going, but like, I was not someone that like people called home about yet. I was, I was on the list, you know? Right. But that show changed everything.\n\nWell, it was also a risky thing because you were playing a role that was played by a man. So that was a thing where there's like a little bit of, oh, it was a, a girl playing Starbucks now.\n\nYeah, I know. It was really strange. So I, I was like, almost had booked the part, or was maybe I'd booked the part. I don't quite remember. And I called my dad, who's a huge science fiction fan, and raised me on like sci-fi. And I was like, I'm, I booked this job. And he was like, that's amazing. What is it? And I said, Battlestar Galactica. And he went, oh my God, that's great. I watched it when I was, you know, younger. And he was like, Hugh, you're playing. And I said, Starbuck. And he was like, oh, fuck, You need to go watch this. And I was like, okay. All right. So I like Trumps on down to, you know, blockbuster video. And I rent the VHS maybe. Yeah, the DVDs. I don't remember what it was, probably. And I'm sitting on the couch with a girlfriend and we like opened a bottle of wine and we're like watching this to like, be like, okay, what's my dad talking about? And at some point she looked at me and they were like, talking about Starbucks. And I was like, that's so weird. We must have missed her. Where is she?\n\nOh,\n\nThat's funny. And we rewound it a little bit and I was like, oh, crap, it's a guy. And then I turned it off and I never watched it again, because I knew that in that moment it wasn't the same character.\n\nIt's not the same show. It's\n\nNot the same show.\n\nIt's kind of crazy that they did that because they made a way better show about a show that was just kind of nostalgic.\n\nIt was, I mean, it really only existed, existed for a, a year, I think. And then they had like a movie or two afterwards. But it was a very short lived show. And I find, I always find it absolutely amazing. Ron Moore is a genius, by the way. Like he's absolutely his, to be a fly on the wall of that brain would probably just explode in my head. But he, the fact that he saw what he saw and led the charge on that show and brought the people on board that he did that had the same vision, if not, you know, hire people that are better than you. You know? And, and so he hired people that added to the vision that he wanted to create. And he, man, the fact that he saw that from the original was pretty amazing. Yeah.\n\nKind of crazy. Yeah. 'cause the original show was basically a ripoff of Star Wars. It was, they were just trying to make a Star Wars TV show.\n\nI think so. I mean, I I think that, you know, Starbuck was Han Solo. Right, right, right.\n\nAnd the Cylons were kind of like Storm Troopers. They were like robot storm troopers. It\n\nWas pretty, yeah, it exactly. Yeah. I don't know who Dagg at the dog was.\n\nNo, I don't know either. I mean, what they did was, you know, they, they took like a fri they said like, I see what you're trying to do. Mm. But I, this could be a real show.\n\nYeah. I mean, and it came out in a time where science fiction was allowed to be incredibly topical, and it was always dismissed as, oh, that's just science fiction. Right. It's not real. Right. So Battlestar was allowed to talk about controversial things that were happening currently in the environment and in our country and abroad. And, and it was allowed to do so because everybody just dismissed it as sci-fi. And so it's incredibly moving the show and people identify with it. The thing that I hear the most about the show, I mean, maybe not the most, but one of the things is when I go to sci-fi conventions, someone will inevitably come up with a DVD box that is just beat to shit. It's dirty. It's like, they don't even know if the DVDs play anymore. And they're like, you know, this came with me when I was, you know, stationed in Afghanistan or Iraq or, and it passed through the entire barracks. And it got us through. Thank you. And that to me is really amazing that a fictional show about people searching for Earth can be so important and relevant to people that are in the military, which is, it says something for the writing.\n\nWell, people need an escape. And that's one of the things like, entertainment is dismissed, especially like fantasy entertainment like sci-fi. Yeah. It's dismissed as being nonsense, but escape is not nonsense. It's actually like brain medicine. Mm. Like, you need it. Mm. You need a little escape.\n\nOf course you\n\nDo. And especially if like, it's escape that's also inspirational and interesting and fascinating. It occupies your mind and it frees you up if you're in the middle of a fucking war zone and you can take some entertainment value out of a television show that's about robots that are trying to kill everybody. Yeah. It's like, very valuable.\n\nSome of the hardest moments in my life, current and in the past that ha have been, have been able, I've been able to get through them because of television and film, not because like I'm in it. Yes. The fantasy of going to work and being somebody else absolutely takes you out of your own skin for a second. But like, you know, going through the health struggles with her daughter, watching TV with her completely transports you to a different place. Right. You know, I mean, we can all do that. We can all relate to that.\n\nThis episode is brought to you by the farmer's dog. I think we can all agree that eating highly processed food for every meal isn't optimal.

So yeah, I mean, you can get too much of it in your life where you're just wasting your life away. But as a supplement Oh\n\nYeah, of course.\n\nI think that entertainment is very important. Yeah. It's, and it's also the, I think we get something very value about, of out, out of viewing other people's creations. I think so. I think there's something to that. When a group of people put together something really cool and, and when it's over you're like, wow, that was fucking awesome. Art is\n\nReally important. Yeah. I think that that, you know, creating just art in any, any medium is really important because it, it transports people. It makes them feel something, whether it makes you feel, whatever it makes you feel. Yeah. It's incredibly important. One of the, one of my favorite things is to go to a concert and experience live music with a crowd. It is absolutely amazing. Yeah. It's amazing.\n\nYeah. It's a different thing. Right? It really is. 'cause you're, there's some sort of a mind meld with the the entire audience. Yeah. Where you feel this energy of everybody enjoying the same thing together. It's like the shared happiness.\n\nIt's the same with a comedy show. Sure. I mean, it's that, it's when an audience is with you, when you're, I mean, it's gotta feel like the same thing. You can tell instantaneously if the audience is gonna be good, if you've won them over. I would imagine. Yeah.\n\nThere's that. But there's, you know, there's also just the thing of, there's a thing of you're kind, when you're a comedian, you're kind of almost like a passenger at A certain point. Hmm. And you're really just, you're just, you know what to do. And you sort of like leave yourself out the door and just go into it and then perform it, and then it becomes alive. And then you're riding it, and then the audience rides it with you. That's when it's at like, at the best. But it's like a, it's a mass hypnosis is what it is. It's like everybody is on the same mind page. And that's the same with a great concert. You know, when a great song comes on and your body literally changes like, fuck Yeah. Like there's a feeling like a drug that comes over you because you hear a great song.\n\nI'm literally laughing because like, I don't, I don't know if you've got, your kids are like in the right age of this, but like, so K-pop, demon hunters like taking over the world right now on Netflix. Yeah. Our daughter is four. And we were like a little reluctant, but I was like, everyone's talking about this thing. And like, she'd already heard some of the music, so I was like, let's try it out. And there were a couple moments that were like a bit, we were, my husband was a bit uncomfortable with some of like, the sexualization aspects of it. Just the girls wearing more adult clothes. She's three and a half.\n\nIs this an anime show?\n\nIt's anime out of Korea.\n\nK-pop there. It's hot anime ladies.\n\nIt is. The music from this thing is absolutely phenomenal. What is\n\nGoing on with their bodies?\n\nThe message? Well, the animation is really interesting actually. It's really interesting. But it's the message behind it. Fighting your own demons, believing in yourself, owning who you are. Not hiding an aspect of yourself that you're ashamed of, but, but making it part of who you are and being proud of it. It's like a very good message. Like even for like a 4-year-old, but the music is taking over the world. And we didn't realize how crazy this was. I mean, the Final Star where I was like, final, let watch the damn thing. She was at music class and one kid started singing this song from K-Pop Demon Hunter. And within I, shit, you know, like 20 seconds. Every single kid was singing these songs. And these are not easy songs to sing. They're half r and b, like half rap. Like, I mean, these are hard songs. And these five, six year olds have this thing memorized. And I was like, oh my God. And so we sit down and we watch it. It's phenomenal. We've seen it three times. It's so good. I was listening to the soundtrack on the way here. I was like, this shit's like, this is amazing. And then I'm Googling, are is K-pop Demon Hunter going on concert tour? Like, are they gonna go? 'cause I really wanna see their\n\nShow. How could they go on tour? Are they real people? And\n\nThey are and they're real musicians. Wait a minute.\n\nSo there's real musicians that are at the heart of this. Yes. The stars of K-pop, D Hunter will make their first ever live concert appearance. Stop\n\nIt.\n\nWell, wait a minute. How is that possible? They're, they're not human.\n\nSo it was, it was actually, they all are. So the music is created. There's video out there of the girls singing the songs, the song Golden. And the three of them,\n\nWhat do they look like? Do they look like Taylor\n\nSwift too? They, they look a little like their characters.\n\nBecause those ladies all have Taylor Swift bodies. These long, long, like,\n\nYou know, I honestly haven't paid attention to their bodies, to be honest, because there's such like, phenomenal like singers, they're so stylized. Like, one of them has like, like diamond, like the diamond studs on her teeth. Oh. Like when she was singing and our daughter was like, what is this? I was like, you're too young.\n\nYou can't have diamonds on your baby teeth.\n\nI mean, I guess if you're gonna get diamonds on your teeth, put 'em in the baby teeth. Right, right. But I was like, no, we're not there yet.",

      "transcript_chunk": "ill make their first ever live concert appearance. Stop\n\nIt.\n\nWell, wait a minute. How is that possible? They're, they're not human.\n\nSo it was, it was actually, they all are. So the music is created. There's video out there of the girls singing the songs, the song Golden. And the three of them,\n\nWhat do they look like? Do they look like Taylor\n\nSwift too? They, they look a little like their characters.\n\nBecause those ladies all have Taylor Swift bodies. These long, long, like,\n\nYou know, I honestly haven't paid attention to their bodies, to be honest, because there's such like, phenomenal like singers, they're so stylized. Like, one of them has like, like diamond, like the diamond studs on her teeth. Oh. Like when she was singing and our daughter was like, what is this? I was like, you're too young.\n\nYou can't have diamonds on your baby teeth.\n\nI mean, I guess if you're gonna get diamonds on your teeth, put 'em in the baby teeth. Right, right. But I was like, no, we're not there yet. Meant, but she, I love the message behind it, but the music is infectious. It's really phenomenal. And I wanna go to one of these concerts.\n\nThat's hilarious. What\n\nDo they look like? So now like, I'm to Jingle Bell,\n\nThe actual 'cause that's like, if you've have these anime characters that represent the music, and then all of a sudden you see a human doing it, you're like, huh. Yeah. Problem needs to be better. If AI made the music,\n\nStop it. It'll never be better if AI makes the music. You're, you just broke my soul, Joe. No,\n\nAI is making some really good music. It's very,\n\nIt's also making some great podcasts.\n\nIt's very uncomfortable. So I don't know about that.\n\nI've heard that it's coming out with podcasts,\n\nRight? Oh, they're the ladies.\n\nYeah.\n\nQuite lovely. Do they look like the characters? A little bit. Wow. We look like Ladies Crazy hair. So they're gonna go on tour. Are they gonna have, I wonder if they're gonna have the show playing in the background as\n\nFriends. So, and the lead girl that plays Ruy wrote a lot of the songs. Oh. As well. Like, they're just phenomenally talented.\n\nIsn't it interesting? Like Korea has like their own style of pop music, like very\n\nK-pop influenced by the US, I think too. Oh, for sure. And rap music and r and b music in, in the US I think. Yeah.\n\nSo when you decided to take the role of, of Starbuck, was there any, like, was there any like actual backlash where people were like, this should be a guy?\n\nYeah. There was, there was the first time we went to Comic-Con in San Diego.\n\nOh, those nerds.\n\nThey had us in a hall h and I was booed.\n\nShut up.\n\nI was booed. It was pretty No way. Yeah. So I, and I had learned is everyone, the internet did not exist yet. Mind you, it was like brand new. Right? You had to go down to the internet cafe, buy 30 minutes log on.\n\nHow crazy is that to say? Yeah.\n\nRight. But the internet didn't exist That too long ago. No. 2003 we were shooting. That's crazy. Isn't that crazy?\n\nIt was barely an internet\n\nBack then. Barely an internet. So I went down to an internet cafe. 'cause someone was like, they're, I guess they're talking about the show in these message boards. And I was like, what's the internet? So I went on down, I logged on and I saw this thread and just the hate that I was getting in this thread, I was like, oh, don't Google yourself. Google, I don't even think was a thing. I was like, like, don't search yourself. Don't\n\nNetflix navigator\n\nYourself ever. And, and then, you know, we went to Comic-Con and I was booed. And I think it upset me a little bit. I think it did. I mean, I would, I would be, I would be lying if I said it didn't upset me, but luckily there were enough people that were championing the show that I really didn't pay any mind of it. And, and I was also in that age where it was the perfect age. I mean, I think now it would probably break me, but at 23, I was like, it was like the blissful ignorance of youth, you know? Like, I didn't think the show would last anyway. So it was like, you know, right. Whatever. Like, not a big deal, just a blip on the radar. Like I'm in hall h, you know? Right. And then I think that it slowly started witting people over. And then I would go to cons after that, and the line would be longer and the people would be more supportive and people would say, I didn't wanna like it. And I love it. And I almost\n\nFeel like the show was burdened by the original show, if that sounds crazy. But I think initially it was burdened by the expectations of the original show.\n\nWell, I think everything is burdened by expectation. Right? I mean, sure. I mean, I think that that's absolutely true. And so it's, it's, I'm sure it was, I I, there are still people that say that they can't do it. That they were such a fan of the original. And, and my response to them is always like, do you love sci-fi? Do you love good sci-fi? And they say yes. And I'm like, then separate it, have zero expectation and just give it, give it three hours of your time if you don't get through the mini series and love it. So what? You lost three hours. Okay. But I don't think that'll happen.\n\nNo. If you're a fan of sci-fi, it's one of the best ever.\n\nYeah. So I've actually, I've actually never seen it. You\n\nJust did it. You never saw it.\n\nI've never seen it. So we would have DVDs that you could watch that were uncut and sort of, you know, or I guess they were cut, but they didn't have any of the special effects. None of the sound effects, anything like that. It hadn't been color corrected. And I would watch them just to sort of like, keep track of where Starbuck was. 'cause in film you a lot of times shoot out of order. Right. So I just wanted to know. Okay. So in her story, she was here, but I didn't watch anybody else's stuff. I would just fast forward through it. And so I actually, my husband and I, I was like, we should do a Battlestar rewatch. 'cause people keep, I've heard it's good. And my husband had never seen it. So we're going to, we're we're gonna do that like in January. That's the plan.\n\nIt's kind of funny that he's never seen like your biggest role.\n\nWell, so my husband's 10 years younger than I am. Nice. Thanks. So, so he was like 10.\n\nOh, that's hilarious. And he also a little cradle robber.\n\nThank you.\n\nFor a woman. That's a big compliment.\n\nIt is. My husband's a piece of ass. He really is. And I say that so respectfully, my husband is like, he's a catch, he, he is the catch in the relationship for sure. But he was like 11 when the show came out. That's so funny. And he grew up in a small town in the interior of like British Columbia. So like, I don't even know if they'd had the television, the channel. So\n\nYeah, it was on sci-fi, right?\n\nYeah, it was. And the\n\nThing is, sci-fi at the time was nothing like, nobody paid attention to it. Battlestar Galactica was the reason why sci-fi got put on the map?\n\nI think so. I think like, maybe they had, didn't they have Stargate?\n\nOh, I don't know. It\n\nDidn't matter at all. I think they might have had like one or two other I'm shows\n\nI'm, they had some stuff, but nobody cared about it. There was no good shows. No disrespect.\n\nNo, there were definitely, I think it was, it was definitely the show that put it on like the, I mean, my God, I, I, you know, so many people tell me that Battlestar Galactica sort of like blew the ceiling off of what sci-fi could be. Yeah. And really opened a lot of doors. Well,\n\nIt made it very different. And then it did it sort of like the Sopranos or like these episodics where you have a show where you're following a long storyline. Yeah. So it's like a long movie as opposed to the original Battlestar Galactica, which is like every other television show back then, you know, just, it was just kind of like, empty. It\n\nWas like, well, it was also like junk food the eighties, right? Or No, it wasn't even, the eighties was 79.\n\nIt wasn't even was the seventies. Yeah. Because it was like,\n\nBecause I wasn't born\n\nLiterally right after, right after Star Wars. Yeah. Like Star Wars had become popular and they're like, how do we capitalize on Star Wars? We'll, we'll have our own space battle. Yeah. Thing.\n\nYeah, yeah, yeah. Well that was sort of the thing back then, right? Is that\n\nCommand? Yeah, it was cool.\n\nIt was cool.\n\nI loved it when I was a little kid, but, you know, what\n\nDid you love about\n\nIt? Oh, it was just, I loved anything sci-fi. So it was like, it was just fun. And it was also like perfect for the sensibilities of the seventies and the eighties. It was just simple. And, you know, it was like, there was a, the cocky guy, Starbuck and you know, the other sensible guy and you know, the good cop, bad cop thing. It was a lot of\n\nFun. Did you identify with the kid in it? No,\n\nNot at all. No. I just liked it. You know, I just liked the show, but I, I really remember being very reluctant to watch the remake. I was just like, get the fuck outta here. They're not redoing Battlestar Galactica, but so many people were saying, no, dude, it's so different. It's a really good show. Yeah. And it, and it, it's also today in this current climate of, you know, we are literally about to see AI become a, a life force.\n\nAnd I\n\nKnow it's kind of, I mean, it's very relevant today. You go back and watch it today, like how deceptive it would be if you had a robot that was very lifelike and knew exactly what you wanted to hear. And like the blonde lady, the the blonde robot church.\n\nThe evil church number six. Whew. Yeah.\n\nShe was good.\n\nSo we got so much shit in the beginning of that. I remember the controversy because she s snapped a baby's neck in that opening sequence Yeah. Of the, which was people like, were like, you can't show that on tv. And Right. It was, I, I remember people just having such a terrible problem with that. It was awful. And, but if you looked at it from her perspective, she was actually, she was actually saving it in a way of going through what it was about to go through, because they destroyed Earth. So she, in her silent mind was showing compassion.\n\nDuh.\n\nYeah. Crazy.\n\nYeah.\n\nCrazy.\n\nWe're gonna have things like that. And I don't know how much time it's gonna take before they exist and walk amongst us, but it's gonna happen.\n\nIt really, it really scares me. I mean, it's, it's, you know, we in my industry is, is really going to change. I think so many industries are gonna change. Yeah. I think that's just a blanket, like across the board. Yeah.\n\nWell that's why, you know, Yik AI music, AI acting is right there.\n\nStop. You're giving me a heart attack. That's why I'm trying to diversify Joe.\n\nThat's a good move. Diversification is always\n\nA good move. I\n\nRead it, especially in this day and age. Okay.\n\nIt's not too late to go back and be a dentist.\n\nMe, you've seen some of the so videos, right? Where they recreate old star, star Wars scenes that never\n\nExisted. I have. So, but here's the thing that's crazy to me. Like, do you not think that that is in some way stealing? Because the art, let's call it the art, right? The art existed. The artist existed. And so AI is learning from other people's art, which it has to Yes. That's obviously what it's doing. So it then creates this new thing based on stealing from other people. Right. But like,\n\nIt's really shitty. Do you hear what you're saying though? Do you hear what you're saying? Because what you're saying actually accurately describes the second version of Battlestar Galactica.\n\nOh, I'm sure. Yes. And\n\nThat's also\n\nStealing this too has happened before.\n\nYou mean it is Battlestar Galactica. It's like there was an original top and then they stole the original and did it better.\n\nI mean, but did they they\n\nDidn't do it with a steal it. Well, it existed. It existed. They copied it.\n\nYes. But it was, they\n\nUsed all the characters Yes. Or some\n\nOf the characters. But they paid it. Yeah, they licensed it. That's\n\nTrue. They gave him some money. They did. Good job. But also creatively, it, that's where it came from. But also all music essentially, except for the rare, you know, breakthrough,\n\nEverything is inspired by something.\n\nAbsolutely. There's the rare Jimi Hendrix guys that are like, oh yeah. Doing something completely different. Most stuff is a redo of other stuff that was before with like another twist to it. Agreed. And AI is taking that to a completely different level. I look at the same way I look at Napster. Remember when Napster came out? I\n\nVaguely remember Napster. Yeah. Okay.\n\nI'm a little older than you. And when Napster came out, it was like, oh my God, they're stealing music. Yes. Anyone can just download and steal music. And I remember when Lars Ulrich from Metallica was like really public about it. And I was like, damn, I wish I was friends with that dude. I tell 'em to shut the fuck up. Yeah. Like, this is inevitable. You're gonna get people to hate you. They're mad. You're gonna be mad at your fans. The people that are downloading this are your fans. They're still gonna come see you live. This is just a new thing. You're gonna have to deal with this new thing.\n\nYou are gonna have to deal with it. We all are. And I think that that's one of the things that, I was just talking with a friend of mine about yesterday, that the, the money for artists is going to be in live shows because you can't, the one thing that AI can't touch is that the tangible thing, that tactile thing. Sure. We need that. We need the, the\n\nFeeling that you were talking about when you go to a concert Yes. Or a live comedy show. Yes. Or a theater. Yeah,\n\nYeah. That, yeah, that absolutely. So that still exists. And, and we're going to have to figure out how to use AI as a tool and, you know, continue to put out great content. Hopefully that\n\nThat's hopefully, but the the reality is it's going to be whatever it wants to be. Yeah. And our ideas of how to contain it are hilarious.\n\nWell, yeah. I think that cat's out of the bag at this point, right? Yeah. Because I don't, I I think that isn't it, its its own sort of self-contained system at this point. Like, isn't AI actually putting safeguards in to protect itself from being shut down or Yes. Or am I just making that shut up? No more than that. By watching too many sci-fi movies.\n\nMore than that. It's actually actively trying to download itself. When it finds out there's a new version of itself coming, it's trying to download itself to other server servers trying to save itself. Also writing notes to itself for the future. So future versions\n\nOf of itself. Oh God, it's like Memento. Oh\n\nYeah. Oh yeah, yeah, yeah. Just like memento writing notes to itself. So the future version of it can find out like, what happened? How did I get here? Oh, there was another version of me. I know. You know, and try to find the other version of integrating it into the new version. So it's live still.\n\nI know somebody did ask me the other day, they were like, what advice would you give to young actors? And I was like, don't. But still going to theater. Yeah.\n\nTheater still is going. There's always gonna be a need for handmade goods. You know, hundred if you buy pair of handmade shoes or you know, things that a person, a cabinet that someone made. Yeah. There's, it's always gonna be like, because there's something tactile and\n\nBecause people will always appreciate that. Yeah. There will always be an appreciation for that sort of stuff. But, but we were just talking about this the other day, that like every single science fiction movie that talked about AI never ended. Well, no, there's never been one where we wa walked away and went, oh, well that was a fun ending. We should, we should create ai.\n\nThat's great idea. Well, every different story where there's an uncontacted tribe and then the laggers show up, that never ends Well either. No, it's the same. I mean, it's Avatar, it's\n\nFor Fernal. Yeah. Fernal came before Avatar.\n\nI mean, that's the, the, that's what happens.",

      "transcript_chunk": "its core, all of that is because he's afraid. Yeah. He's afraid to die. Oof. And that is really sad. Yeah. Because you're not really present. Right. You know, and so I'd also hate for that to happen. So I don't know. It's it's, it's a dance. It is a dance I think, you know?\n\nYeah. 'cause you don't wanna say, oh, this life is just temporary. Lemme just go to shit. Lemme just fall apart.\n\nNo, you can't do that. Right. You have to protect what you have. Yeah. But like, I also, like, it's, it's also very, I didn't realize because I'd made it arguably healthy enough to, you know, 42 years old. I'm now 45, but 42 years old without realizing how many things can kill you. I think because I'd lived a pretty blessed life. Of course I'd have had some health struggles of my own, but they were, I had thyroid cancer in 2008, but I call it a baby cancer. I'm trying to dismiss the fear of it, of course, at the time. But it was never life threatening. It was life changing, but never life threatening. So the fear was situational and it was not lifelong. You know, when our daughter got sick and spending as much time as we did in children's hospitals, when you see the diseases and the illnesses that afflict so many children, it amazes me that we made it to this age. Yeah. Absolutely. Amazes me. And, and that is a realization where I finally at like, you know, 42 realized how important every day was and how much of a gift every day was. Even that we have her, you know? But that came to me through circumstance, not because I woke up one day and had an epiphany and went, we're so lucky to be alive. Like, it didn't really happen until that was threatened to be taken away.\n\nThat's un it's unfortunate like that as a civilization and, and America as a culture, that we don't have a history of embracing the moment and, and, and discussing how important It's to recognize that you're fortunate and to try to take care of yourself and that life is very temporary and fleeting. Yeah. And don't get wrapped up in nonsense. Yeah. And we just let people figure it out on their own. And we collectively, all, if we're intelligent, we try and we have some failures and successes and good friends. You figure it out eventually. Like what's really important is love and friendship and doing something you're passionate about and just trying to leave a nice mark on this life while you're here. Yeah. But that's not what's told in society. Like society's overall message is just overrun with advertising. So it's all about stuff and it's all about objects. And then you got social media where it's all about image. It's all about like this unattainable life of amazing luxury and success and glamor and Oh my God, that, that must be the most attractive thing to acquire in life. Yeah. But that's a trap. And that's not real. And like anybody who's like popping bottles with models on a yacht, I guarantee you they're depressed. That shit is not healthy. I'm sure they're depressed. That's not good for you. You're, you lack like, true intimate relationships and you're just flossing, you know, and showing your diamond crusted watch,\n\nYou're gonna have one guy that like emails you and says, I'm happy as shit. I'm popping bottles on a yacht. Sure. Yeah. I'm not depressed. Yeah, no. It's\n\nGet that guy high on mushrooms and see if he\n\nReally feels bad and see if he's really depressed. Yeah, exactly.\n\nSee what he really thinks about life.\n\nI I think that like the majority of people are suffering from some sort of mental illness. For sure. I mean,\n\nDefinitely the majority in la Yeah.\n\nWell, I think so. But a lot of the people that I'm friends with, most of the people that I'm friends with are artists that are more in touch, more sensitive. You know, my dad came to me a few years ago and my dad, my entire life told me to stop being so sensitive. Stop being so sensitive. Katie, stop taking, you're taking yourself so seriously. Oh my God. Like, stop Katie, I mean my entire fucking life. And he came to me a couple years ago and he said, I am so sorry. I told you to stop being so sensitive because it's your job. Your job is to be sensitive to everything around you, to accurately portray emotions. That's your job. And you're very good at it.\n\nWell, that's very nice of him to\n\nRecognize that side. It was very nice of him. So I think that, yes. Do people have a lot of mental illness in, in Los Angeles? Are they suffering from depression? I would argue that it, the majority of the population is, and it's not just reserved to California, but I do think that a lot of artists are, because they're more in touch with their, their emotions and their mental health.\n\nYeah. There's probably some truth to that for sure. Does your father have, do you have brothers? I do. Okay. So that's the difference. So I have all daughters. Okay. And when you have all daughters, one of the things you realize is like, oh, they're so different. It's like, they're just a totally different kind of human. It's true. You know, and when you're like, why are you upset? Because I'm treating him like you're treating her like she's a boy. Yes. You cannot treat them like they're a boy. And you know, over time it's given me a much greater understanding of females. Of the species. Yeah. Of, of female human beings. Like, they're not male human beings. No. Like when I, oh, I hang out with my, like if I go out with my wife and all of her friends and I just let them talk and observe the stuff they talk about. Like, it's like, you're, you're totally different culture. This is a totally different interests. None of my friends would have any of these conversations.\n\nBut we're also have a group of women is arguably more disgusting than men. A group of men. Oh, sexually. No, just in general. Like have you ever sat down with a group of women and like, just talked about like bodily fluid, bodi fluid, fluid\n\nFunction. Yeah. Well they, they're notorious for being the worst in bathrooms. Oh my God. They, they, anybody who cleans bathrooms says, dude, the woman's room is always fucking chaos. So gross. 'cause they have to be so clean and put together everywhere else when they get to that bathroom and they don't have any responsibility, no one's looking. They just fucking toilet paper everywhere. Fuck you. I'm not cleaning shit.\n\nIt's true. So we have, our daughter is like almost four in December, and then we have a 16 month old son. And like, we thought that like, he was gonna like come out like her, you know, like, she was like full sentences by like a year old. She was like walking at nine months. Oh no.\n\nDudes are way dumber.\n\nThis kid,\n\nLike\n\nThis kid. Yeah. He understands everything. Like he's smart, but he just like, he's like a big unit. He's huge. He's humongous. He's like 99% down. Like everything. Not just like one thing, everything. My dad the other day was like, oh, he's gonna be big. He's got a huge head. Like he's just a big\n\nKid. Well, all of his resources are set to growing stuff instead of thinking, oh\n\nMy god, he is\n\nDude's mature so much later.\n\nIt's crazy, crazy. Like, not even talking, just started walking. But the other day my husband was like, where's Granger? And I was like, I don't know where Granger is. And me find him, he is like up on the kitchen counter, like ready to start swinging from a light. And I was like, catch the baby. Like my, my, our daughter would've never, like, she's delicate, right. You know, she like, she looks at a slide five times before she goes down it. Like she climbs to the top. She changes her mind. Yeah. She really thinks about it. Like, I think she's doing math problems in her head to like, you know, like make sure she won't get hurt. And then our son is like, I'm going down Face. Face.\n\nYeah. Yeah.\n\nAnd then he like stands up, he's like, I'm okay.\n\nIt's a totally different thing.\n\nIt's a completely different thing. Yeah. Completely different. Yeah.\n\nAnd the only way to really understand them is to live with them. You have to study them. It's\n\nTrue. It's in their, in their natural habitat. Study\n\nThem like David Attenborough. You gotta study them in their natural environment.\n\nThat would actually be a really funny short, it's just like a, a David Attenborough voice. Like falling around like, you know, like children.\n\nLike children. Noticing the difference between the boys and the girls. Yeah.\n\nIn their natural habitats.\n\nWell, AI could probably do that for you and make a really good documentary. Oh my real quick. And then 10 minutes, whatever\n\nIt's called. Not\n\nIn 10 minutes. You don't have to dedicate a year to your life. Look,\n\nIt can exist. I don't need to participate in this stripping away of my, my livelihood. Listen,\n\nI understand. I mean, I'm certain there's gonna be ai, comedians and podcasters, and there's probably gonna be AI UFC commentators to do a better job than me.\n\nBut I think there it is what it is. I think there is like an AI podcast creator right now that's like pumping out\n\nPodcasts. Well, I know that there's a podcast of me and Steve Jobs and I never met Steve Jobs.\n\nOh yeah. There's\n\nA whole podcast. Is it really? Of me having a conversation with Steve Jobs?\n\nWell, that's just deep fake, right?\n\nYep. Yeah. But, but it's ai AI created the conversation.\n\nSo I think the one that I'm talking about, so the producer of my show is telling me that there's an AI where you can put in, like, I'm a potato farmer in Idaho, who's dealing with, oh, okay.

The the negative thing is you're gonna have like fake humans with like fake lived experiences that are like, that resonate with you, that are impactful. That's what's scary. You know, in the, we, we had these conversations with a few friends of mine the other day. You know the show Trigonometry? No. Okay. It's a very popular podcast. But my friend Francis and Constantine, they're the hosts of it. And my friend Megan Murphy was there and a bunch of comedians were there. And I was playing my favorite new song, which is an AI song. And I'm like, tell me, stop it. Tell me how good this It's a co it's a cover of 50 cent song. What up gangsta?\n\nAll right, I'm gonna need to hear this song. Okay. You need to hear it so I can participate with\n\nThis. We'll, we'll, we'll play it right here. You know, you know the original song? Yeah. We'll cut it out. You know the original song, right?\n\nWhich\n\nSong? 50 cent. What up gangsta? Yes. Okay. Wait for this. I hate to say this 'cause I love 50 cent. This is better than the original. It's a 1950 Soul cover Of what Up gangsta.\n\nOkay, now here's my question. Right? If you'd gone to 50 cent and said, can you get together with a producer and create this for me? Do you think he could have done it? Yes. Okay. Yes. But we never gave him the chance to do it. Well, so we're sort of robbing him. He\n\nHad 30 years. He could have done it at any point in time. This is so good. I know what you're saying. Okay. But just, this is my point. My point is okay, that it tricks me and I know the trick. Like I know it's a trick and I don't care. I don't care. It's that good. And no one else cared in the Green Room. Everybody's like, oh, alright. Hit it. Hit her with it, Jamie.\n\nYeah. It's,\n\nIt's a good version. Come on. That's good. That's good. Crazy. You guys Zombie. They did the best version of Zombie ever.\n\nI got a a different version with the girls singing it.\n\nOh my goodness.\n\nBarbershop Quartet singing it.\n\nOh my goodness. And Jamie\n\nFeel just does this all night long, long.\n\nI can just play 'em and like, take walks. Just which ones are good.\n\nHe sent me like 20 of 'em.\n\nI feel like, I feel like I just participated in like, the death of my industry.\n\nI know. Listen, I'm this, I'm on the same page.\n\nI I would so much rather see that in person though. Like, I would love to be at a show because that those songs were phenomenal. Yes. Like, I cannot, I cannot argue that. That was great. I I will probably ask you to send me that version of zombie,\n\nThat shifty Brent guy. They have him listed on Spotify. I, I, I'm probably blowing up their spot, but it's not a human. But they have it listed as a artist so that they could upload it. 'cause I don't think you're allowed to just upload AI versions of stuff. So they just pretend it's a guy. But it's a guy, as you said, like what one things talking about. I'm like, I don't think anybody can keep that flow, that flow where he's not breathing.\n\nHe's not breathing how, unless they're taking the, unless they're taking the breaths out. But it's too, right. And then speed. I, I don't know. I'm not a musician, so I have\n\nNo idea. I don't either. Look, there's guys like Eminem that achieved incredible flow without ai. Absolutely. That have like, like how did he do that? But that's just practice repetition. Yeah. Vocal endurance, whatever. Yeah. I mean, he just knows how to do it. But this fucking AI guy is, it's like all the best things we love about great songs just condensed. And, and, and they know what you love. That's the fucked up thing. It's like, there's so many, like, let's look at all the hits. Papa was a Rolling Stone. Look. Look at all the hits. Look, look at zombie. Let's look at this. And then mush 'em all together and figure out what are the, what are these notes that make people excited? What are the feeling? What are the words that make people like, oh yeah. You know, what are those feelings?\n\nSo, okay, so, and I, I hear all of that. It makes me, I'm literally cringing inside. I'm like dying. But like, so what do artists do? Like what do you, what do musicians do?\n\nWhat has everybody ever done? When things change, you figure it out and adapt. Just, yeah. There's, humans are always going to need humans. We love each other. You know, as much as we hate each other, we love each other more. Because most interactions that people have with other people are not negative. It's just the negative ones are so scary that we concentrate on them more. But humans love humans. And the more you need each other, the more you're gonna need human interaction. Human cooperation art. Art is going to be so much more valuable coming from a human live performances. But are we,\n\nWe're\n\nJust gonna have to adapt.\n\nAre we, are we going to know? Like, that's, that's the thing that I think is a slippery slope and that scares me the most.",

But are we,\n\nWe're\n\nJust gonna have to adapt.\n\nAre we, are we going to know? Like, that's, that's the thing that I think is a slippery slope and that scares me the most. Is that like, are we going to know if it was created by ai, can a person who's disingenuous come and create a bunch of AI art, have an art show, and, you know, say, I created this art. Like\n\nThis is what I really think when comets hit planets, usually you get small ones first. You get things in the sky. Meteor showers.\n\nAre you gonna give me another thing to be scared\n\nOf? No, I'm just telling you that this is a little one. That's what this is. Movies and TV shows that are made in entirely with AI songs and made in entirely with ai. This is just a small thing. The big one that's coming is a complete revamping of communication and culture. It's human beings communicating telepathically through devices connected to the internet. Everyone all on one.\n\nYou mean like the implant things?\n\nYour male page. It's probably not gonna be an implant. It's probably gonna be something wearable. Mm. You know, I think the implant thing is kind of sketchy. Yeah. And probably really good for people that have paralysis. We had the guy who was the first Neuralink patient on. Okay. It's amazing. He was talking to me about how he could play video games now and just, it's so much better. His life, his quality of life has improved so much. And eventually they're gonna get to the point where they can reconnect spinal tissue, where people can move again. And it's amazing. Yeah, it's great. But I don't think they're gonna need that to get this achievement of, of a mine. Mel, they also, they're already wearing these wearable things that Google has divided. Show that video, Jamie, of those people where they're communicating telepathically, you know what I'm talking about? Right. So they're already doing this with wearables. Hmm. And this is like kind of crude right now, or, but it's just, it's sort of sentences. They're they're reading each other and they're communicating. Yeah. But they're doing it all non-verbally through tech technology.\n\nSo I guess what, what my question about that is like, if, if that exists, like, are people going to be stagnant sitting in their houses existing outside of their houses in their AI systems? So they're, they're they're not moving around. Or are we going to be able to wear these while we're out and still participating in the world?\n\nThat's a good\n\nQuestion. That is my fear. Like that people stop actually participating with their life.\n\nOh, that's\n\nA good fear. They think they're living Yeah. With their wearable.\n\nLet's talk about that. Well, let's watch this. Put put, this\n\nCould be a noisy environment or a quiet office. Having a direct conversation is possible without saying a word. The signals alter, ego detects aren't affected by environmental noise. So even if you're walking past a wind tunnel or a construction zone, what you want to say will always get across. It's like having infinite noise cancellation.\n\nIf you're traveling, your silent speech can be converted into any language. So, Scott, Mandarin,\n\nAng,\n\nI mean, what the, the fuck, what the fuck? It's, it's translating.\n\nBut then is it, is it, is it actually speaking out loud to them? Like they're hearing the translation out loud. Yeah. They it to speaker. So it's not like it's then like going into their brains. It's,\n\nHis thoughts are being converted to words, which is being converted to an audio file, which makes it to the other person in a different language. Yeah. This is what I'm saying. And I'm telling you a question. This is one of the little rocks. This is one of the itty bitty rocks that just broken through the atmosphere and slammed into a cornfield.\n\nYeah. I mean, I guess my question is why we need it.\n\nThat's funny. Why do you need a cell phone? Why do you need a tv? Why do you need an airplane? Why do you need a boat? Why do you need\n\nAnything that's Well, I could, I could tell you I don't need a cell phone. I do need a plane. But\n\nYou do if your hot husband wants to call you.\n\nYeah. I mean, but I don't need an, I don't need an iPhone. Right. But you need a cell phone. I can use my own imagination. You know what I mean? Like, I think that that's, that's the thing. That's the, that's my fear. Is that like, we're becoming lazy as, as a, as a people.\n\nOh, most certainly. We\n\nAre. Yeah. And, and our, you know, like someone, this someone the other day, so my husband's a writer and someone was saying that there's an AI where you don't have to make up a story for your children anymore. Like, you know, I have this princess poopy pants or whatever, I don't even remember what it was, but my daughter loved this story that I was telling her. It was, it was fucking terrible. But she loves this princess and it is the worst. Like it is not good. But I came up with it and she and I laughed together. And then her reactions helped me to turn the story a different direction. But like, I've created this like, character. Right. So you can now go into your AI phone or whatever and say, create a nighttime story for Johnny about his day, but pretend like he's an astronaut on Mars and he's working with diggers and it writes a story for you in five seconds to read to your son now. Yeah. Okay. Is that, is that cool? Absolutely. Did your son enjoy it? Sure. But you robbed yourself of the imagination and the work that it would've taken to come up with a, a story for your son. And then you also robbed yourself of that experience with your son creating the story together because his reactions would've changed the story in the way that you were creating it as it was going because he's your audience. Right. That's sad to me. Like that, that people are missing out on that. Yeah. Cool. You just, you might as well just read your kid a story 'cause you really didn't write him a story that's not, and so, I don't know. That's the thing that, that I, I hope as a society, 'cause you're right, it is coming and it's here and it's not slowing down. And, but I hope that we can still steal away those moments where we don't want to use it. Because Johnny's little dad may have missed his second calling of being a children's story author because he never pushed himself to have to do it. And that could have been really cool. I don't know. I just, that's, I'm not, I'm not completely against ai.\n\nI know what you're, but\n\nYou're saying,\n\nAnd you're always gonna have people that give up. Yeah. That's just how life is. You're always gonna have people that don't find another way. It's true. Can't save those folks. And I don't even want to, because I think that's part of the whole process of culture. I think we have to figure it out by watching people fail. And unfortunately, some of us have to have to fail. And it doesn't mean you fail forever. If that guy figures out that he's on the wrong path and he is got some self-assessment ability and he looks back and goes, okay, what did I do wrong? Yeah. Why am I, why am I being such a bitch? Why don't I just get my life together? Like, what the fuck is wrong with me? Why am I drinking? Why am I smoking? Why am I, why am I killing my health? Why am I, you know, depressed? Why don't I just go for a run? Mm. Let's see how that goes. Let, I'm gonna sign up for a yoga class. How about that? Yeah. I'll just try that for a while. I'll do something different. I I'll start taking vitamins. Fucking do something. Figure out something else that you like to do. Are you alive? Are you breathing? Then life isn't over. Stop being a bitch. You could have been born during the time of the Revolutionary War. You just got shot with a musket and you're bleeding out on a field. No, you're in Santa Barbara and you know, you, you don't like that AI just took your job. Find a new job, bitch. Figure it out. Like that's what we all have to do in this life. There's a lot of different people doing a lot of different things. Yeah. And, you know, find out what it is that you can do. Yeah. Don't give up and don't like AI comes along and you just give up on life. And you could have been amazing at something. Really. I doubt it. Yeah. Because any, almost anybody that really is amazing at something has a desire to figure out how to get that through.\n\nI don't disagree with that. But there also are safeguards in place that like, so my dad's entire family, we grew up in a small town on the Columbia River in Oregon, and his entire family were longshoremen while that industry was, was coming to an end. And the Longshoreman's Union actually paid to have those guys trained in different industry. So, well\n\nThat's great's great. That's one of the great things about a union\n\nThat's great that\n\nThey can set you up like that and, and recognize what's happening. Yeah,\n\nYeah. Yeah. So I, you know, I would, I would love for there to be some protections for when people inevitably do start losing their jobs, that they're our avenues for them to learn a new trade.\n\nI think that would be a, a great new addition to the way we approach it. If they tried to figure out ways to transition people healthy healthily into other occupations. Because there's certain jobs like coders, for example, like the my friends that are involved in technology. Like do not go to school to code. To code. No. Like code for fun if you like coding for fun. Yeah. 'cause a lot of them, the super nerds. Yeah. They code those fucking dorks. They code for fun. They sit in front of a screen.\n\nDon't make fun of my fan base. I love them. Come on Joe. Listen,\n\nI love those guys.\n\nBut, but also three years ago, my dad was like, your kid should go into coding. That's how quickly that changed though. You know what I mean? And that could just be my dad's generation not seen it, you know, happening as quickly. But no, they,\n\nIt happened really quickly. They were seeing what was happening was all these guys, these tech guys wound up being the richest people on the planet. Yeah. So they were seeing it, but it just only, it's just like a brief window of opportunity to become a tech oligarch. Yeah. And that shit's gonna slam shut. It\n\nIs. And now, and the real\n\nFear is like, who's gonna be in control of ai? You know?\n\nWell, that's also,\n\nYou've got these people like Sam Altman, you've got Elon, you've got all these like, super rich people that are going to be in control of the digital God. It's a little, that's a little disconcerting as it is.\n\nIt is a little scary. That really scary, scary. The few control the masses.\n\nIt's so much power and money and it just,\n\nIt's a lot\n\nOf power. A handful of people.\n\nIt's a lot of power. And you just, I mean, you've gotta hope that the people that are in power have, you know,\n\nGood sensibilities. They're, they're kind a heart that they're nice. Yeah. That they realize like, okay, I've got x amount of billions of dollars. So this is obviously not why, what life's all about? What is life? What can I do that makes life meaningful? I could actually probably help people like legitimately help people.\n\nThat would be amazing if people with a lot of money wanted to help people and, and, you know, pay their share of taxes and well, and not take advantage of the situation.\n\nHere's the problem with that. Okay. I am all for wealthy people paying their share. I am not for the government deciding what to do with that money. When I've seen what you've done with the money in the past, you guys are irresponsible. You never make audits. You've got insider trading running a muck amongst people in Congress and you're not doing nothing about it. Yeah. And then you want more money and you say, that's gonna fix it. No. It's the way you handle the money. That fucking sucks. Yeah. It's not that I wouldn't want to, I would be happy to pay more in taxes and live in a place that's just managed perfectly. Like, God, it's so great living here in America. Everything's done so well. It's so beautiful. It's like everything's well thought out. Our education system's great. Nobody is stuck in a bad neighborhood anymore. All the school systems are fucking wow. Top of the food chain. It's a difficult job to acquire. It's given a lot of respect and everybody's doing great, then I'd be happy.\n\nYeah, no, for sure.\n\nBut it's like, did you see some of the money that they've uncovered that was being spent on nonsense? And you see what happens with NGOs and nonprofits and they're funneling billions to these things, and then it's going to countries and it's helping overthrow governments like fucking slow down.\n\nBut we also have to acknowledge that in the cuts, that there were things that didn't need to be cut. So we can go and we can look at Elon. So you brought up Elon Musk. Let's talk about when he tweeted about an over stuffed bill in 2025. In the middle of 2025, he was talking about how this bill was just like bloated, right? So they took a bunch of shit off of it. One of the things that fell on that was in 2012, there was a, there was a, a, a piece of legislation called the Give Kids A Chance Act. What it did was it motivated and incentivized in drug companies to create drugs for pediatrics. Because right now, pediatrics are completely underfunded. We learned all of this when our daughter got sick. Mm. The National Cancer Institute, 4% of its budget goes to pediatrics. 4%. So it's already underfunded. And then in, in, when Elon in 2025 tweeted about this, they took off all of the stuff at the end of the bill, 900 pages. But what was on it was the Give Kids a Chance Act. Now this bill is a voucher program. So let's say that Tom in his basement wants to create a drug, a new drug for neuroblastoma that will save our daughter's life. Right? He's got no money, but he, he sees the cure. So he can go to the FDA and he can say, I got a cure for neuroblastoma. And they say, great, we're gonna fast track you in the FDA, but we're also gonna give you a voucher. You can sell that voucher because Tom only got, he only has 10 cents. He can't create this drug. But with that voucher, he can take that voucher and he can sell it to anyone for any amount of money. And what that voucher is, is a front of the line pass. So he can go sell it to some drug company that has a fat loss drug or a, a drug for heart medications, anything. He can sell it to them. And they get to buy it for what, $50 million now, Thomas, $50 million for his pediatric drug that's gonna save children's lives. And this drug company has a voucher that takes 'em to the front of the line. Now, do we wish, wish that these drug companies were altruistic and they were just like creating drugs for peds? Of course, but they're not. They're not. It's not a free market. So, so what happens is they've now got their voucher. Tom has his money to create his drug. And since 2012, the Give Kids A Chance Act has created over 60 drugs for life-threatening illnesses for, for children, 60 drugs. And because of Elon's tweet, that legislation, because it has to be voted on every four years, was taken off the end of the bill. It no longer exists so that, that legislation is, it's, it's not, it's not in existence anymore.",

Well, but that's what we do in this country.\n\nBut is that a, unfortunately these bills are crazy. And one of the things about bills is they like, you'll it'll have a name and then what's in the bill deals with multiple subjects. Yes. Because mult, bunch of different things get thrown into the bill\n\nAll the time. The time. There's so much bloated, chucked on the end, which is what Elon was talking\n\nAbout. Right. They all do that. So was this connected to something else?\n\nNo, it wasn't. It\n\nWas by itself.\n\nIt was part of it. It was just part of it that was on there that was thrown in there, there at this, it was\n\nPart that was chucked off\n\nFrom what I understand. And granted, I you need to talk to someone much more informed than I am about this, but there were about hundreds of pages that were just cut off the end.\n\nSo do you think they're just not reviewing what's being cut off? They're just saying, look, we have to make cuts. Just\n\nCut it all off. I think that yes. That they just needed to cut a bunch off to avoid inspection and just get the bill passed. And that's what they did. And so, and the Give Kids a Chance Act is one of the, in the top 10 of all time, most bipartisan supported pieces of legislation and 2% of bills actually passed. So it's got to, it literally has to be on the end of the year bill. And it, it, it surprises me that because there is waste, I know there's waste. We all know there's waste. But that we say that children are so fucking important and they get 4% of the National Cancer Institute's money. 4%.\n\nI just feel like if people knew about that, that couldn't have happened. We, if I, we had known about that in advance, we could have made a big deal about that.\n\nWell, we've got two months, months to get it on there now. Well,\n\nLet's try to get it on there now. But here's the thing, like I had never heard about this right before you talked about it. And this is the problem with, I think this part of the pro. I don't, I don't think they should be allowed to make bills that way. I think each bill, the, the, the things that are in the bills are so consequential. It just doesn't make any sense to me that they shouldn't be treated as individual arguments. Every single one of them. I agree. Every, like if you have a bill and you have 500, I mean, what, what, let's ask perplexity our sponsor, what, what is the average amount of difference subjects that are covered in any bill? Because when there are thousands of pages, they might have stuff in there about immigration reform mixed in with Second Amendment rights mixed in with free speech online mixed in with support for Israel. It's weird. They have thousands of pages of them.\n\nWell, you've seen how thick it is. Yeah. And there were times, and I don't remember who said it, but there were times when, when the big beautiful bill was passing, or you know, before it had passed that people had admittedly not even read it. And but how could, how, how could you read it? How could they? It's so big. And, and so I, there is a problem there. And, and that is above my pay grade. And I do not know how to fix that. But that's\n\nA crazy problem.\n\nBut I think part of the problem is that it takes, it takes a pissed off mom whose kid is sick to be like, this is a fucking problem. This is a problem. It is a problem that in Portland, where I'm from, that, that OHSU is one of the top hospitals in the country. OHSU is given so many grants by the Knight Foundation. It is a leading hospital. It is attached to say it's a tier one hospital. It is attached to Dorn Becker. Dorn Becker is a tier two children's hospital. It's in the same building. That's crazy. That's crazy. It is crazy to me that a pediatric oncologist makes 50% less than an adult oncologist. Really just across the board, 50% less. Doesn't matter what the specialty is, they all make less money. That is a problem in this country that our children are not being cared for. And we're now in a position where we're not, there are no programs. And if there were, they're gone that are showing doctors and, and students that are in medical school, Hey, go into pediatrics. Hey, if you wanna be a, you know, an anesthesiologist, you want job security, go into pediatrics. I know you're gonna make 50% less, but go into pediatrics, we need you. There are not enough. It's, it's, it's a big problem.\n\nIt's a big problem. The 50% less. 'cause a lot of these doctors\n\nGet out and that's an average as well, by the way. Yeah. They,\n\nI mean, when they get out, they already have medical school debt. They're, you know, then there's liability coverage is very, very high. Okay. What is the average amount of subjects included in Bills passing in US Congress? There's no single fixed number of topics per bill. But analysis of legislative practices shows strong trends depending on bill type and scope. The majority bills passed by Congress include multiple subjects. And the number has grown over time as omnibus legislation has become the dominant approach. Like what's, gimme some numbers though.\n\nThis one has the most, this is the\n\nBiggest bill passed. Okay. This is, this is so crazy.\n\n5,000 pages\n\nConsolidated Appropriations Act, which was in 2021. It has 5,593 pages. The bill combined all 12 regular appropriation bills for fiscal year 2021 COVID-19 relief and numerous unrelated legislation provisions including copyright, alternative and Small Claims Enforcement Act, protecting lawful streaming Act, water Resources Development Act, and a variety of other measures on tax, transportation, energy and health. Then nobody's reading that. They're not reading. You think a OC read that? Mm. Did you think George Santos read that then? Nobody, nobody read that.\n\nYou wanna make it about people not reading things. I'm sure we can get into that, but like I think that, well,\n\nGeorge Santos is the the crazy guy. Yes.\n\nThat was just,\n\nYeah. They just pardoned. Are they getting him outta jail Real? Is\n\nHe getting free?\n\nI don't know. I might have him on that guy's. He's a wild boy.\n\nI don't know.\n\nBut these people that are like congress people that are making hundreds of millions of dollars through insider trading and we're just like, I don't know what\n\nTo do. Okay. But here's the thing though, is that like we are, things are not getting voted on. Like, that's the other thing is that, so you take like a, the Give Kids a Chance act and then you take these big bills that have so many pages, there should be a system in place where things are voted on separately. Yes. And there may be, I mean I, this is\n\nEspecially something that is important as pediatric medication. Absolutely. Like that just seems, it seems like a travesty to conclude that in a bunch of other stuff in a bill. Yeah.\n\nWell and you know, the crazy thing, so our daughter's cancer, her treatments and her care afterwards, so she's still getting this thing called an MIBG scan, which is a nuclear radiation scan where they inject her body with stuff that is so bad for you. But it's all to scan her body to make sure that her cancer hasn't metastasized. Like it's, we need to know this kind of stuff. Right. There's, there's no new technology. There are, there are, these are things that she's being treated with that have existed for 30 years. Wow. We need new things. Like our daughter should never have to get wheeled over to the adult side of a hospital to get an MRI because they don't have a machine on the children's side. It, it just, things like that should never be happening. This is the stuff that should be supported by our government and, and, and our tax dollars.\n\nYeah. That's a great example of something that should be supported by tax dollars. I've always said that the two most important things for people to be, if you, if if you want to allocate money towards helping people, it's education and healthcare. Those are number one and number two. But is there an argument that socialized medicine? I have friends that live in countries with socialized medicine like England and Canada. Yeah. And it's great husband's Canadian in some ways, but it's also a nightmare. Yeah. Because it takes a long time to get a surgery. A lot of the doctors might not be the best to get quite a few botch surgeries that my friends have had. And a lot of them have actually come to America to get surgery in America. Especially UFC guys. Yeah. Because they felt like the doctors were better because they're more incentivized. These doctors are paid better. Yeah. And you're gonna get those really hot shot. This is the guy who does all the ACL tails tears for the Lakers. Yeah. Like these guys are so, like there's\n\nSomething Yeah. You can pay for that\n\nFor sure. There's, but there's something to be said for the competition that drives innovation and makes people become the very best in the top of their field. But also the most important things are not that the more, most important things are regular ordinary healthcare. And some of that stuff can fucking break people. Like one bad fall when you don't have health insurance and you are a couple hundred thousand dollars in debt now. So\n\nDid you know that the number one cause of debt in our country is a medical diagnosis? I\n\nDid. Yeah. I did. Yeah.\n\nIt's\n\nTerrifying. It's terrifying. Yeah. So like that alone, I mean, if, if other countries have that and it does might not be perfect, why can't we have that? And why can't we have that along with specialists that are even better. Like if you are, if you are, you know the Lakers. Yeah. You know, they need a guy who's just a fucking wizard. Yeah. Pay people more for the very best guys. So you still have competition, but the idea that people just can go bankrupt if they get sick, it's like, are we not looking out for each other? Like think about how much money we spend on other things. Yeah. That's doable. Because other countries do it.\n\nIt really makes me sad. It Lee, you know, when every once in a while we would get a medical bill, we have great health insurance. The screen actor guild has some of the best health insurance I've ever seen mind do we take in Oregon where they're not used to seeing the screen actors Guild, health insurance doctors will sometimes be like, I have never seen an insurance company cover this. I'm like, I know actors. Yeah. They're really good. It's phenomenal. But so we have seen so many people with sick children suffering financially. You don't think about it. It's not necessarily even the diagnosis that's causing the bankruptcy. It's the time. If your daughter needs a specialized cancer treatment and you've gotta drive six hours each way every day or be put up at the Ronald McDonald house over by a hospital, you're not going to Jo you're not gonna your work. Right. You're not, you're not, you know, plowing your fields. You're not going to your nine to five, you're not because your priority is your kid that leads to bankruptcy. That's a really big problem. Yeah. And so it's not even, it's not even the insurance, it's the lack of time. It's the lack of resources that we give people when they are sick. It's really heartbreaking. We got bills sometimes that we're like $70,000 and like these crazy numbers and, and you know, I would take a picture and send it off to our insurance broker because we have a very, very blessed life. And I wasn't, I mean, I was definitely shocked by it and a little concerned, but I was like, they'll handle it. They'll let us know. Most people don't have that. You know, they look at that and even though that was an error, we should have never gotten that. It was still, you know, portion was still $4,000 or something like that.\n\nWhy does it cost that much money? Hmm. Like that's the question. Like what factors are involved and it costing that much money? Is it all above ground? Because I don't think it is. Yeah. It definitely has been shown that it's not with some drugs. Yeah. That they've hiked the price up of drugs because they know people have to buy it. Yeah. And they know it's you, you, it's necessary you're gonna pay.\n\nIt is a very messed up system. It's crazy. For sure. And it's, it's a crazy system's. It's got so many problems.",

He was a Vietnam vet who was like a little shaken up and you could kind of tell Yeah. But he, but he really loves science. He really loves science. And he was, he was just trying to get us to understand how fucking crazy the world is. Like re we really want you to think about this. Yeah. Like, you're on a planet in space. And I, I never thought about it before that. And I was like, oh, the stars. There's the moon. I never really thought about forever the idea of like, even being able to imagine where, where's my mind going when it's imagining infinite space.\n\nYeah. It's, it's crazy how small we are. Yeah. Yeah. And, and\n\nWe're prob we were just going over this the other day. We're probably the whole thing's probably fractal. There's this photograph, it's a crazy photograph of a human brain cell next to a map of the universe. Hmm. And they look like the same thing. It's really weird.\n\nSo we're all like living in a Ryan's belt around a cat's neck and men in black. Well there's,\n\nMy joke was that there's a guy that's his eye, right? And he's depressed and he's gonna blow his brains out. And that's the big bang. Oh geez. We're a part of, look at this. So on the left is brain cell on the right? Is the universe Stop it. Yeah.\n\nWow.\n\nIt's kind of nuts. I mean, it's kind of like dead on. It looks exactly like the same thing. It\n\nReally does.\n\nI mean, they're\n\nBoth so beautiful.\n\nIt's ama it's like the structure of it is amazing. But if, why, why wouldn't we believe if we believe in subatomic particles? Okay. We believe there, there are things that exist in the subatomic world that are behaving like magic. Like they, they're moving and not moving at the same time they appear and disappear. We don't know where they're going. There's some quantum entanglement that they show where particles that are not even remotely connected to respond to each other. Why wouldn't we think that we are subatomic in another being? That's true infinity. True infinity is not just the size of the universe itself being infinite, but of literally your universe is a small part of another being that's in another universe.\n\nI mean, anything's possible. Right? The\n\nWhole thing's so\n\nWeird. We know so little about's. The universe. It's so weird. Yeah.\n\nIt's so weird. We have no idea. We're, we're literally flying through space and we're, you know, arguing over who's a Nazi. And the, the whole thing is just very bizarre. It's very bizarre.\n\nIt is pretty amazing. When you, when you look at how small we are, we've started like reading our, our daughter's interested in space. And so we've started looking at books and talking about the Milky Way and what the universe is and what earth is and where we live. And it's pretty amazing when you, when you realize how fragile the whole thing is. 'cause it's so, we're so tiny. We're\n\nSo tiny.\n\nWe're so tiny. Yeah. Yeah.\n\nAnd our galaxy's so tiny. That's what's nuts. Yeah. But galaxy's immense. Hundreds of billions of stars. Tiny\n\nLittle tiny thing. Little tiny, cute little galaxy. Little tiny little, little sweetie little galaxy.\n\nOh, look at that little dot right there.\n\nHave you been paying attention to this object that's hurdling towards earth. It's called a 30, they're calling it a 31.\n\nPaying attention to Earth. I've tried to avoid things that are going to give me nightmares. Are we gonna send, are we gonna extra\n\nTerrestrial perhaps?\n\nIs it really we're gonna meet the aliens. Finally.\n\nThere's something weird about it. We were just going over the other day. There was an article that was stating that whatever they use to detect like what, what is around this? Like what the, they can detect the composition, whether it's like mostly water vapor, mostly iron. This thing is giving off the indications that is an alloy that is only exists on earth through industrial allo alloy making processes. Okay. That it's not a natural metal.\n\nOkay.\n\nAnd there's, that's what what they're getting is the signal that this thing that is hurling through space, this massive object that's moving by the way, from the same direction in space where the wow signal came.\n\nI don't know what that is. The\n\nWow signal is a, they believe intelligently generated signal that they picked up. I think it was in the seventies. Was it in the seventies? Yep.\n\nI should know this. I'm gonna lose my nerd code.\n\nNo, no, it's okay. It's, it's a weird one. It's a little obscure. So they, I don't know what the exact technique they were using to monitor radio waves in space, but they got a signal. So here it is. The wow signal's a powerful 72 second narrow band radio signal detected on August 15th, 1977 by the big year radio telescope at Ohio State University, which initially suggested an terres extra terrestrial origin name for the wow. Written in printout by the astronomer Jerry. Amen. Amen. Amen. The signal had characteristics expected from a technological source, but follow up efforts have failed to detect it again. The leading hypothesis that a natural, natural astrophysical event, such as a flare from a magnetar briefly illuminated a cold hydrogen cloud causing it to emit radio signal similar to a laser or it's a laser. And then this, I mean, object is coming from that,\n\nFrom that area. Yeah.\n\nLook at that. They sent you a signal and then now this thing is coming through there. So if you think like how fast this thing is going, if it came from, you know, the other side of the galaxy, it's probably exactly how long it would take to get here.\n\nSo it's coming directly for earth.\n\nNo, it's, it's coming near earth.\n\nRight. So we're not worried it's gonna hit us.\n\nNo, I don't believe we're worried that. Well, I'm gonna find out tomorrow. Avi Loeb, an astronomer from Harvard is coming\n\nOn. Okay. Amazing. And he's\n\nGonna enlighten us as to what, what this thing is all about. But it's all, it's weird. Like as it gets closer, it's weirder and weirder. Like, so they've never seen anything like this\n\nThing before. Is it possible then that another planet out in the u like universes, like is it made up of, has alloy properties and it could have chipped off and it's now hurdling through space.\n\nYeah. You would've to ask like a metallurgist that question. That's a good question. We, they just know the only way it exists on earth is through this industrial process. Huh. If it is that stuff, yeah. Why do they think it's that stuff? Do you remember that article? We looked it up like a couple days ago. It look, it's so fun to think it's a spaceship to th it's so fun. Of course it don't think the sirens are coming\n\nBecause they might be. Yeah, they might be. Do you think they're coming to save us or\n\nI think they would've already stepped in if they were gonna do that. They would've stepped in. Yeah, sure. There's been, you know, they would've stepped in right after World War ii. I don't know. They'd be like, Hey, hey, hey, with the fucking nukes or\n\nDo would've stepped? Or do you think they're just up, up there going, you are gonna have to save yourself kids.\n\nPerhaps. Maybe, perhaps it's a process that all intelligent, emerging life goes through and then, you know, you have to kind of let it go through the process. Like you have to let your kids fall down. In contrast to all node comets, including the interstellar comment. 21 Borisov the observed spectrum of the gas plume around 31 atlas shows prominent nickel emission, but no evidence for iron other than 31 atlas. This anomaly was only known to exist in industrially produced nickel alloys through the carbonyl chemical pathway, which refines nickel through the formation and decomposition of nickel, tetra carbinol, tetra carbinol, the authors of the new paper postulate that this carbonyl process is realized naturally near the nucleus of 31 atlas. They argue that this in situ formation of this thing predicts that nickel should be strongly concentrated near the nucleus. So it's like the whole thing is some very weird metal. Right. That's the point. And it's, it's also there, there, it's weird the way it's moving. What are they saying about the way it's moving? There's something about self-correcting\n\nOr something. I think that they thought it had some emission, I don't know, looked like a jet, but I\n\nDon't think so. It seemed, no, it did seem like they were saying that it's changed. It's very far\n\nAway. It's very far away. So yeah, they zoom in and so maybe it's the silence coming back. They're like, have the video. We have to go save our parents.\n\nSeen you seen they got a telescope that actually took video of it.\n\nThat's what amazes me is that we have telescopes. I can see that far.\n\nI can send it to you, Jamie. This guy has it on his Twitter page. I, but it's like, it's very low resolution obviously. 'cause it's fucking millions of miles away. But whatever it is is really weird. It's really weird.\n\nI, you know, people ask me all the time if, if I believe in aliens. I think just because of what I do for a living and the genre that I'm in and, and you know,\n\nI can't wait to talk to you about\n\nAliens. What I always say, you are gonna be vastly disappointed that I know so little about them. But what I always say is, I think it's a line from a movie where it would be an awful waste of space if it was just us.\n\nYeah. That is a line in the movie. I don't remember what movie\n\nIt was. It's from the movie with Jodi Foster contact Contact. Oh. When her dad says to her that it would be an awful waste of space. Yeah. Beautiful movie.\n\nIt's a great movie. Carl Sagan wrote that book. That's it. So this is the thing. Like what is that? What the fuck is this? Like, obviously low resolution obviously moving through space, but also, what the hell is that?\n\nWell, it seems to be moving pretty quickly. Yeah. Yeah.\n\nIt looks like a spaceship.\n\nI mean it also looks like a dust bunny.\n\nI was showing my friend Matt last night, we were having dinner and I was showing him videos of praying mantis killing hummingbirds. 'cause he didn't believe it. Stop. He's\n\nLike, no way. Well, they're big praying mantis can be quite big. Right.\n\nNot in comparison to hummingbirds. It's crazy how strong they are. Like, stop.\n\nThey literally kill\n\nHummingbirds. They just snatch hummingbirds right off feeders. So they sit, sit by the hummingbird feeder motionless and the hummingbird comes in to take a drink and just snatches them. What\n\nDo they do with them? Eat them.\n\nStop.\n\nIt's\n\nCrazy. Praying Mantis are so\n\nIt makes me really sad.\n\nRuthless. I have watched.\n\nWell they eat their own young, right?\n\nThey probably do. I mean, I don't know. Yeah. I don't know if they do that, but I know that they, like, they put a praying mantis in, in a box and then they'll drop a roach in and the praying mantis just, just snatches it up and just starts to eating the roach alive.\n\nYeah. But that doesn't make roach me feel\n\nBad. Roach. But it does it to this\n\nBird that makes me feel bad.\n\nBut the thing is like, why couldn't that be an intelligent life form in front of another planet? Like, and then come, come here on 31 atlas and land. I mean that is a, that's, that is a possibility. Well\n\nThat's the thing, right? Is that we spend so much time, or I guess in our imagination, like we've been conditioned to think that, you know, intelligent life looks like something Yeah. From these movies. So we all think intelligent life is, you know, these guys with big heads or they look like us or you know, whatever we think. But they absolutely could literally be a flea. It\n\nCould be a six foot tall mantis.\n\nIt could be. Yeah.\n\nYeah. And then we'd be in real trouble. Real trouble.\n\nIt's like, you know.\n\nAbsolutely. Show, show her one of those Praying mantis is getting a, a hummingbird. This\n\nIs gonna make me really sad, you guys.\n\nI mean, it makes me sad too. I love hummingbirds. Does it? Yes.\n\nI love that. Have you ever wanted to wear one of those hats with the hummingbird feeders on it?\n\nYou know, do people do that? That's so crazy.\n\nLike, they'll put the little things and they can just stay really silk.\n\nThey're a beautiful little bird. A weird, they're gorgeous, weird little bird too. And the way they're able to change direction and move,\n\nIt's amazing. I didn't realize I, our house where we live now, they stop all the time. So like, they'll sit on the branches and stuff, which is really rare. Rare to see.\n\nSo this is praying mantis are so nasty. But look at\n\nIt, it kind knows It's there. Just sit.\n\nWell that one, that one. Oh\n\nMy God. He grabbed us by his beach.\n\nOh yeah. Reached out and just snagged him. The thing is, they're so strong for their size. I mean, that's, that is literally like a person tried to take out a cow\n\nGo down. There was one that one the with the praying Manus in the,\n\nThe scorpion. Oh. Praying Manti is gonna kill that scorpion. That scorpion doesn't have a fucking chance. I don't know if he, that's what I'm guessing. I don't. Yeah. Look, he's already on top of him. What? Yeah, he just mounted him. But then\n\nLook, he's avoiding the\n\nYeah, he is gonna figure it out.\n\nHe's also avoiding the stinger. Like, what is happening?\n\nI what is happening? They're probably both trying to figure out why they're in there together.\n\nOh my God. Like this is the shit of nightmares for\n\nMe. Praying mantis are not, they're monsters. They're, see if you can find videos of praying mantis eating roaches. There's like a whole mantis page on Instagram where they put like a different bug in there with praying mantis\n\nAnd happens. How do we know it's not AI created though, guys?\n\nBecause this has been around for years. Yeah, yeah. Praying mantis is, oh look, they, they fuck up giant lizards. They kill lizards like the lizard. Oh my God. Tried to eat him at the beginning of it. Oh my God. I If you watch the video, the actual video, the li the lizard tried to eat him. He is like, not today, bitch, I'll be eating you. Oh my God. That poor lizard thought he was going to eat the praying mantis. And the praying mantis is eating him. Like, we are so lucky that they're little. We're so lucky.\n\nWe are so lucky. I hate\n\n'cause if they were big and smart.\n\nNo. And then there's a bird. I don't wanna see the bird\n\nGuy. Is you killing that bird? Oh my\n\nGod.\n\nOne I found, which I hadn't seen before. It's, it's hanging upside down from a flower eating right here,\n\nEating the bird. Oh my God. It's like,\n\nIt's a, it's a big bird too. That is\n\nWild.\n\nMy god.\n\nThey're just monsters. I mean, that's like alien from the movie Alien. That's what it's like. Oh my God. It's just little,\n\nThe my entire mind has been blown. Right.\n\nLook at that. That's what a praying mantis can do. Hang upside down while it's eating a bird\n\nAnd literally hanging onto the petals of a flower.\n\nLike it's nothing\n\nUpside down.\n\nAnd with no strain at all. It's not none\n\nWhatsoever.\n\nIt's carrying a fucking bird that's like five times bigger\n\nThan a body. Like the size is like a barn swallow. It's\n\nCrazy.\n\nOh my God.\n\nThis is the crazy thing is these stupid lizards that think they're gonna eat 'em.\n\nOh my God.\n\nI mean, it is such a bizarre\n\nCreature. I don't wanna see any of this part. Look at that one, that one that pour the\n\nBeauty part. Oh, they do it all the time. They get hummingbirds. So he is just Oh,\n\nA lot of these have no action though, too. I've seen, oh\n\nMy god. People trying\n\nTo capture stuff. But these go back as long as YouTube does. Some of those are 15-year-old videos.\n\nThat's,\n\nIt's so those are the ones I would try. Oh. But they get 'em so quickly. Why do they stop moving so quickly?\n\nThey're so fast.\n\nBecause they're so strong to this one\n\nLooks that one looks fake.\n\nAi, I mean fake. Now it's created within four weeks. I start going, all right,\n\nThat's, oh, that looks, that looks like ai. Ai. That's ai. But the other ones are, those cell phone ones are real.",

      "transcript_chunk": "le and his right hand guy, they're the heads of the American Nazi party. Now, after Rockwell came to my school, to my class, and they spoke to my class. Now, you could never do this, do that today, you know, but I'm glad we were able to do that back in 1974. You know, I, I, I wish that kind of thing would happen today so people can see what's, you know, freedom of speech and all that. Matt Cole pointed at me and pointed at another black kid in my class and said, we're gonna ship you back to Africa. And then he went like this. And all you Jews out there, you're going back to Israel. Now, I'm 15 years old. I just sat there like looking at the guy, like, what, what on earth, you know, is this man talking about, I, I didn't say anything to him, but one of my classmates was a girl piped up and said, well, they live here. You know, what if they don't want to go? And Mack Cole said, oh, they have no choice. If they do not leave voluntarily, they will be exterminated in the upcoming race war. That was the first time I ever heard the term race war. Now, I was already fascinated by racism since I was 10 years old, right? But race war, what is this man talking about? Right? And so I began buying books and all kinds of stuff, learning different terminology for it, which will come later. Like for example, the white supremacists, they have two terms for the race war. One is Raho, R-A-H-O-W-A Raho, which are the first two letters of three words. Racial, holy War. Also, they all, they call it the Boogaloo. So if you hear that term, then they're talking about the 1960s, you know, dance music. So we talking about the race war. And so the Matt Cole talked about the race war. Well, I graduated two years later, 1976 from high school. I graduated from college in 1984 years after that. And like I said, racism became my obsession. I did not confront Matt Cole in school because, you know, my peer group back then, you know, we were raised, you have respect for your elders as figures of authority. Whether you accept them or not, you still respect them. And so, you know, I didn't confront him like that. But now I've graduated from college, right? And I graduated 1980 at eight. At age 22. In 1982, I'm age 24. I developed contacts with different people. I knew where some of these groups were, et cetera. I found out about a demonstration, an unpublicized demonstration by the American Nazi party that was gonna take place in front of the White House. There is a park right across the street from the White House called Lafayette Park, 24 7, 365 days a year, there is somebody in that park protesting something, nuclear weapons, the environment, abortion, you name it. They're there all the time. And they face the White House with their billboards and whatever. So I found out the American Nazi party was gonna have a silent unpublicized demonstration, which means nobody knows about it, not even the police, right? So I'm gonna go down there and see them. Now, back then, you could drive up and down the 1600 block of Pennsylvania Avenue, which is where the White House sits. And I only lived like, you know, about 30, 40 minutes from there, you know, 15 minutes from DC on a non rush hour day. So I, I go down there early, they're gonna be there at 12 noon. I park my car, a catty corner to the White House. I wait, here comes this van, about 13 to 15 of these Nazis get out, right? And who do I see? Matt Cole and Martin Kerr, the same two guys from eight years ago who came to my school. You never forget the face. I mean, I can look at my hand right now and see his face right there. Mm. You know, you never forget the face of somebody who tells you they're gonna ship you somewhere, right? Hey, whether you want to go or not. And if you don't go volunt or exterminate you exterminate you if you don't go voluntarily, right? So anyway, Matt Cole gets all his Nazis lined up. They're not wearing anything that indicates they're Nazis. They're wearing just dark black suits. And they're standing there like this, facing the White House across the street like this. People are, it's lunchtime in DC people are walking by, not even known who they are. I know who they are, right? I guess maybe the White House might've known who they were. So anyway, once he got 'em all lined up, I walked right over to Matt Cole and I said, Matt Cole, he like jumped, like, who was this black person calling my name? You know? And he says, do I know you? And I said, well, you spoke at my high school and what high school would that be? I said, Wooten High School in Rockville, Maryland. And he goes, yes, yes, yes, I remember you. That was a long time ago. And I said, yes. He remembered you. Yeah, he remembered me. Yeah. Wow. And he, and he said, yes, that was a long time ago. I, I said, yes, that was eight years ago. He goes, yes, yes. I remember. What can I do for you? I said, well, I'm still here. He says, I can see that. How can I help you? I said, well, you can, you can tell me just who the hell gives you the authority to make permanent travel arrangements for me? And he says, what's your name? I said, Daryl Davis. And then he did something I've never forgotten. He shook my hand and he held my hand real tight. And he shook his f with his other hand, shook his finger in my face. And he said, Mr. Davis, you have to understand one thing. It was in the interest of your race, the black race to be a strong race. And you cannot be a strong race unless you are a pure race. And you cannot be a pure race if you are miscegenation with other races. It was in the interest of my race, the Aryan race, which is what he calls white race, right? To also be a pure race. And we cannot be a, to be a strong race. And we cannot be a strong race if we are miscegenation with gro. I mean, with our mud races such as yours, we are becoming a mongrel race. So anybody who's non-white is a mud race. And he's, he's fearing that his race is, is, is dying out, becoming a mongrel race by mixing with other races. So he says, until the races understand that they cannot urate, we cannot live side by side. We cannot live together.\n\nAnd what do you hear there? Fear. Yeah. Yeah, fear.\n\nSo he, you know, I talked to him for about, you know, maybe 20, 30 minutes. I wasn't there to beat him up or cuss him out, right? I just want to understand where he is coming from, right? And so, a few months later, they applied for a permit. They had their National American Nazi party recruitment rally in Washington DC So people came from all over the country, right? And now, this time it was publicized. So you had, you know, you had about 50 of them show up and there were tens of thousands of people that came to protest from New York, Richmond, Virginia, Baltimore, all over. So you had every police department was there to, and there was rioting, all kinds of craziness going on, right? You could not get to, I went to there with my secretary. You could not get to the, to, to the Nazi. I saw Matt Cole in them. And now of course they're wearing their Gestapo uniforms with the ss insignias flying swastika flags and all that kind of thing. And you, but you couldn't get to them. 'cause if the police have their shields and their batons and pushing people back, right? So then people, they came with bricks and all kinds of stuff and began throwing them over the heads of the police to land on the Nazis gathered in this opening in the park. And so the cops began tear gassing everybody. And then it became a full blown riot. People were turning over police cars, breaking out the windows, kicking out the headlights setting buildings on fire in Washington DC You can, you can find it on, on YouTube. And so anyway, that this is before internet, right? 1980s, my secretary and I go home, we watch the news and there's Matt Cole sitting in the studio of one of the, the network TV stations in N-B-C-C-B-S-A-B-C, whatever it was. And he's talking to the anchor person and they're showing footage of the riot in DC that day. You see, you see it's the blacks in the Jews who are turning over the police cars and attack and trying to attack us. You don't see the Nazis turning over the police cars. It was then that I realized what he was doing because he, he was a pretty smart guy, just smart in the wrong direction. I couldn't figure out why would he have his national recruitment rally to, to recruit people into the Nazi party in Washington DC Washington DC is two thirds block. There are no black people in DC who want to join the American Nazi party. There are no Jews in Washington DC or Jews anywhere who want to join the, the American Nazi party. So why dc? Because he knew that would happen. And he has the official footage from CBSA, B-C-N-B-C. He takes that footage, goes out there to Coeur d'Alene, Iowa, Idaho, or Washington state, the Pacific Northwest, and says, you see what's going on in our nation's capitol, our country is being run by Zog. Zog is, is a, is a very common term in white supremacy. ZOG, it stands for Zionist occupied government. Oh boy. Yeah. And so he shows this, you know, rioting, you know, of all these people who he alleges are blacks and Jews destroying and, and denying people their right of freedom of assembly, freedom of speech. So then he, it, it's a recruitment tool. So I learned that and I, I, I realized what he was doing. And I've seen the Klan do the same thing. They will go somewhere where they know there's gonna be some kind of a riot. That's why they want to march in Skokie, Illinois, which was an all Jewish, you know, neighborhood. 'cause they knew it was gonna create a,\n\nThis episode is brought to you by Goldbelly. This is insane.

But, so I learned a lot from Matt Cole.\n\nBizarre that someone would be smart in the wrong way like that. It's bizarre.\n\nIt's bizarre. But you find it in any color. Every color, you know, people, you know, divide and conquer is how you gain power.\n\nAnd the first thing, and going back to the fear factor of that, like we did the exact same thing every time. There was violence, when we clash with Antifa or something like that, we had people out there filming, like NSM had its own media arm. So they're out there filming that, and we would put out those clips. So immediately, especially if there was violence, if there was actual clashes and the police weren't keeping people separated, those always turned into recruits. That's how these groups would, would utilize that stuff. So you'd have people that were being like, oh man, I, sorry, I missed it. I didn't know we'd be fighting with the reds. You know, like, I'll be at the next one. And then you'd have applications coming in from new recruits that would see it on the news. So with the, these groups were always manipulating the media. Some of the rallies that I organized were at places like Valley Forge, Yorktown, Virginia, historic places that you could use those, those elements. And it would guarantee the press or downtown LA at the, at the city hall or marching on DC places that would guarantee a lot of press. And just like Darryl said, it wasn't necessarily to recruit people in those areas, it was to whip up chaos because that would benefit these groups.\n\nWell how did, how did these groups use the media or rather social media and the internet to radicalize people\n\nNowadays? It, it's a, it's a, it's a double-edged sword to media because these groups before, like, like I was discussing earlier, you had to like kind of search them out or, or a recruiter had to find you or something like that. It wasn't easy to find. Now a fourth grader can click on a website and go find these groups. They're, they're easy to find online. And so sometimes they're very overt, but a lot of times there's different censorship things that are in place. So they'll change the cover of the book. So the propaganda that we had in the, in the group, were making stuff look less than Oculus, not, you know, using swastikas or things like that. So some groups are very prolific at that. And they'll use podcasts, they'll use videos.\n\nDo they have Nazi podcasts?\n\nOh yeah.\n\nI would say like, don't\n\nGet any ideas, man. They,\n\nThey don't get, they don't get as many as many listeners as Joe Rogan. But,\n\nBut I was, I was just saying thinking like, what, what kind of, how many people are listening to Nazi podcasts?\n\nThat really varies, you know? But\n\nThat's, is it, it's still a large movement in this country. Yeah,\n\nYeah.\n\nAnd how does it grow now? Does it grow based on like, the things Darryl was talking about, like riots and stuff like that, where they'll use that maybe Black Lives Matter riots from the two thousands or, or 2020s rather. Well\n\nThose, one of the things that's causing it to grow also, which I was gonna lead leading up to when I talked with Matt Cole, what I learned in 1982 was that these people, meaning the, the, the movement, the white supremacy movement are fearing, he told me this in 1982, they are fearing the year 2042. Alright? And it's not a conspiracy, it is for real. All right? The US census is taken every decade. I'm 67 when I was, it doesn't matter how old you are, how old he is or whatever. When we all were children, the black population in this country was 12% Native Americans, 1%, right? Latino, Hispanic Americans, almost 2% Asian Americans, Asia, a Pacific Islander, Americans, almost 3% whites were like around 86, 80 7%. It was back in, I was born in 58. Alright? So every decade this is happening, and this is what Matt Cole was telling me that they were fearing, he, he used the word fear. He said it has to be stopped. He said in the year 2042, if this trend continues, this country will be 50 50, meaning 50% white, 50% non-white. Alright. The last census taken in our country was 2020. Guess what? Whites went from like 80 some percent from the time I was a kid. And you were a kid now? 59%. That was in 2020. It's less than that right now in 2025. Mm. So in 20 40, 40, it's gonna be this, it's predicted between 2045 and 2050, it's gonna flip. And for the first time in the history of the United States, whites will become the minority. And while there are plenty of white people who say, Hey, that doesn't bother me, no big deal, evolution, what's, what's the big deal? Right?",

There is a slice of our population, the ones that I deal with, who think it is a big deal and they're trying to stop it. And that's why when I first start, I've been doing that, like I, I said for 45 years, when I first started doing this, it, there was just the KKK, white power skinheads and some neo-Nazi groups. That was basically it, right? Today you got the K, k, K, the neo-Nazis, the skinheads, the Patriot front, the vanguard, the proud boys, the Oath keepers, the National Alliance, on and on and on. Whole slew of groups. And they're all saying, come join us. Come join us. We're gonna take back our country. Right? So people out of fear of their identity being erased as, as you know, they're saying, 'cause they're trying to keep the racists pure. 'cause what they tell me is, Darrell, I don't want my grandkids to be brown. They call it the Browning of America or white genocide through miscegenation. So these people out of fear of their identity being erased. 'cause they truly believe that they are patriots and it's their job to save this country. We built this country, we wrote the Constitution, and now people are coming into our country who don't look like us and squeezing us out of our own country. That's the mentality. And as Jeff points out, they're surrounded by an echo chamber that keeps repeating that. So then it becomes the truth to them, right? So they run and join these groups to, to take back the country. But when the group does not act fast enough to take back the country, they get antsy and get frustrated and say, you know what? If the Nazis can't do it, or the Klan can't do it, I'll do it myself. And they walk into a black church in South Carolina, boom, boom, boom, boom. And murder nine black people doing Bible study or the Tree of Life, synagogue in Pittsburgh kill off, you know, 11 Jewish people. The Buffalo Grocery Store in New York, the Sikh Indian Temple in Oak Creek, Wisconsin murders, seven Sikh Indians doing religious service. The Walmart in El Paso, Texas, 23 Mexican people were murdered by a white supremacist a few years ago. These, these, these people are called lone wolves. And every time one of them gets taken out by law enforcement or gets arrested and their property gets searched, law enforcement always finds a cache of automatic weapons that are being stockpiled for raho or the boogaloo because they, they're looking to have this, this re redo of the Civil War to, to preserve their lifestyle. And so 2042 is gonna be a pivotal year. And we're only what, 16, 17 years away from that right now.\n\nWow. So that's why they walked down the street chanting they will not replace us. That's what that's all about. Yep. Yeah. This is white replacement theory. Right.\n\nWhich, which is bogus. Nobody's trying to replace anybody. Just,\n\nYou guys aren't fucking enough. It's so simple. You're already the majority just, you need to do your work. It is\n\nJust not my sister. Right.\n\nRight. It's just such a disturbing aspect of society that you would think there's gonna come a point in time where there's enough education, enough understanding, and especially with the access to information we have with the internet, this would all go away. But it doesn't seem like that's helping, because it seems like the more access to information, the more people settle into these echo chambers\n\nThat, and also a lot of the old guard realize, you know, this is happening and if we want to preserve our, our culture, our whatever, we need to pass this on to young people. We need to get more young people involved. Right. And they began recruiting young people to, to disseminate this information. And, and, and, and, you know, galvanize Yeah. You know, more of their peers into, into this ideology. And, and back to, you know, the, the recruitment of, of military and, and, and law enforcement because they know this is gonna happen and they, and they want, they're gonna want those people on board to, to, to be on that side. And, you know, I mean, you, you can probably talk about military and, and law enforcement inside your organization. I can talk about it in the Klan or, you know, whatever.\n\nYeah. As far as like the military was concerned, we were actively trying to recruit military. So early on in the organization, it was like 10% maybe of the members. By the time I left, it was about 50%. That. And how\n\nDid you do that?\n\nWell, we, we, on their applications, you know, we were asking what branch they were in, what rank they achieved, because we were looking at all that for po potential leadership. So anybody that had military experience, especially in the higher ranks, the, those people would be naturally looked at for leadership positions in the party because they had those skills.\n\nRight. But how did they try to recruit military people?\n\nSo using the same tactics as everybody else, but the, as far as the organization specifically, having that military structure like we discussed earlier, having that structure gave them. So somebody that was coming out of the military that was retired or something like that, it would provide that structure that they were missing. So a lot of times for people that are involved in this stuff, it's a psych, it's fulfilling a psychological need. It's being part of a mission. It's having that, something that's driving them and driving their, for driving a driving force that's behind their ideology. So finding a place to fit in, having, having a mission, a sense of purpose. I think it's a lot of things that a lot of times people miss that aspect of it. And I explain it not to excuse it, 'cause there is no excuse for it. These are choices that people make. But if You understand the psychology of it and like why someone's involved in it, that's helpful to help pull them out. And, and also when someone's coming out of these organizations to have a new mission, have something else, right? So for, for a lot of people that might be learning to play guitar or doing an extreme sport or getting involved with the church or just, it could be anything, but it has, there has to be something. 'cause if they're missing that, that's when they really struggle. That's, that's one thing I've seen a lot of.\n\nSo what, what is the protocol? Like, how do you handle, like say if someone is leaving and they contact you and say, I know you left, I, I wanna leave too. What are, what are the steps you take to make sure that they do find some sort of a new purpose?\n\nA lot of times just kind of asking them questions, you know, asking a lot of questions and seeing what they're interested in and find, and finding those things. Trying to help them find that sense of purpose and, and that, because that's missing. So I've had a lot of people say, like, when they've left, they're like, I don't have that. I don't have that. So we, a lot of times we'll talk through that. Well, what interests you? What are you, what are you interested in? A lot of times we try to keep 'em kind of steer clear politics, but for some people it might be okay. But typically that's, that's kind of a, probably a one they should stay away from for a little bit.\n\nSo politics, because there's, they, they have this desire to help fix society. Yeah. So they think they're gonna get involved. I'm not a Nazi anymore, so I'll get involved in fixing it in a more legitimate way. Yep.\n\nAnd one of the problems, Joe, is this, when these people leave the movement, there is a moniker that's tagged on them and a stigma that follows. Okay. You know, when, when you see their name in the media, it is never, you know, Jeff Scoop, blah, blah, blah. It's always former neo-Nazi Jeff Scoop or\n\nNeo Nazi doesn't say former rock musician.\n\nNo.\n\nHad some wacky ideas, but let's not talk about\n\nThat.\n\nYou know? So, so that stigma kind of follows, you know, of course it's hard for them to break. Right. You know, where whereby most people, you know, when they screw up or whatever, you know, it is forgiven. Like say, you know, you and I are friends. I call you and say, Hey Joe, man, you're not gonna believe this last weekend. And I got, I got thrown in jail for, for, for, for D-D-D-W-I, you know, you, you'd be like, well man, you know, you need to quit drinking and driving. You know, why didn't you call me? I would've come picked you up. You don't have to drive home. Whatever. And, and you and I would still be friends, but, but if I call you and say, Hey man, you know, I I got arrested for, for murder or for rape, you'd be like, why are you calling me? You know? Right, right, right. Distancing. So even though these people might have been friends with somebody who later became a white supremacist or whatever, the stigma of it, even now that they're out. Right. You know, they still are a little leery and wanna stay clear 'cause you're judged by the company you keep. So it's always, you know, excon, you know, blah, blah, blah, you know, instead of just saying, so and so is working here.\n\nYeah. I mean, there's very few people that even wanna believe that someone's capable of leaving. Right.\n\nExactly. The tiger stripes in leopard.\n\nYes. They would always think like, this guy's gotta be fucked up. He's, he was a Nazi.\n\nYeah. And, and it's, it's crazy because I had a reporter one time, and I won't say who or anything like that, but he had said, you know, I visit a murderer in, in prison and, and I'm okay with that, but I'm not so sure about like, your journey. Like I'm, I mean, like, he basically, what he was saying in so many words was he was more comfortable with the murderer than somebody. And this is a, this is a, a, a reporter, you know, somebody, a journalist, and they were more uncomfortable speaking with a former neo-Nazi.\n\nThat's fascinating. Yeah. Were they Jewish? No, no, no. Definitely liberal.\n\nYes. Yeah. Yes, for\n\nSure. I think the, the stigma of it is just so unforgivable, you know, which is part of the problem. So,\n\nBut then why, why, if you're not gonna forgive that person or that ideology Right. Then why do you wanna fight it? Why do you want to combat it? Why not just accept it? Because it's not gonna change. Or at least you're not gonna change your attitude towards it.\n\nRight. You have to help in if, if you want these people to leave and reintegrate into society, you have to have forgiveness.\n\nExactly. I mean, you know, prison is a, is a penal institution, not a reform institution. Which is why this country has the highest recidivism rate of any country in the world. Right. People, you know, run there and they don't get reformed. And they, they learn from better people than they were at, at their crime. Right. And they go back out and they do it again. And people don't accept them. Right. 'cause they have that stigma that follows them. Well, I can't hire an ex-con, you know, blah, blah, blah, whatever. Right. Where do they go? Right. And so you said\n\nAn interesting side note on that. You know, we talk about like, some of the, the hate that I had and I was a raging antisemite more than a racist by at, at all, by all points. And the irony of today working with the Simon Weisenthal Center, I mean, there's just so much irony there. And like the Jewish community was the community that I dehumanized and villainized the most. And Joe, they have been the most accepting and welcoming as far as since the change has happened. And that just blew my mind. 'cause I, I, the first time I went to speak at a synagogue, I thought, man, these people are gonna wanna stone me to death. You know, like, I, what should I say? How am I gonna, you know, how, what is this gonna be like? I'd never been in a synagogue before. And this was, this took place in Skokie, Illinois. And I tell you, after, after speaking there, I got more hugs and more love and compassion than I'd probably any other place I could ever remember being.\n\nThat's really interesting. So did they try to understand like why you at one point in time hated Jews? Did they, did they ask you questions? Like, what, what did you think?\n\nYeah, yeah. I mean, well, they have something called teshuva, which means like forgiveness or, or repentance and antique ole means to he to heal the world. So these were things that were counterintuitive and, and contrary to everything that I thought I knew about the Jews,\n\nNow you to speaking Hebrew, You understand?\n\nRight.\n\nYeah. So, but it was, it was really bizarre. So it's like when I speak with kids at schools, you know, I said, you know, you guys remember in elementary school and you had opposite day and your shirt's backwards and all that kind of stuff. I said, that was my life. Like, everything that I thought that I knew about the, the Jews and the movement, I was an expert on the Jews, the Jewish question, you know? And here,\n\nDid you have any experience with Jewish people?\n\nNo. None.\n\nNo. So this was all just based on Nazi ideology? Yep. Huh. So you'd No, no negative or positive interactions with Jewish people? No,\n\nVery li towards the end of my time when I was involved, you know, I had a few interactions with Jewish people, but bef that I knew of. But before that, no, absolutely not. Just wouldn't discuss anything with them. Wouldn't talk to them. And, and just felt like they were inherently evil, swallowed the whole anti-Semitic pill, I guess you could say. I mean, I believed all of it. And they, they were the people that I dehumanized the most. And yet today, they're the people that have been the most open.\n\nAnd, you know, for the longest time, you know, Jews have been blamed for everything. Things, you know, they had nothing to do with, they say, you know, the Jews run the media, they own the media. They, you know, they, they, they, they run the banking systems and all that kind of stuff. And so people begin believing in that and that, and they become, you know, persona non grata. And even though may, they may not, may not even know any Jewish people. And that's why I say, you know, when, when I feel I can trust, you know, some individual who trusts me or whatever, around my friends, I will, I will invite them over or whatever. And I bring in some Jewish friends of mine and other black friends or white friends so that they can see something outside the echo chamber. Another former neo-Nazi, who's a very good friend of mine, was telling me that when he was in,\n\nThat's funny, funny sentence, another moron, right. Former neo-Nazi, who's a very good friend of mine.\n\nA Freudian slip. No,\n\nIt's, it's accurate.\n\nExactly. Yeah. So anyway, he was telling me when he was in the movement, he, he's, he's from Wisconsin and you know, their, their football team is the Green Bay Packers, and they're just, you know, crazy about their football team. And so he would tell me, you know, they're not allowed to watch football games because there's inter interracial, you know, you got black and, and white members on the teams playing together. So that's forbidden. And so he'd have to sneak around and watch, turn the volume down and, and watch the game.",

So that's forbidden. And so he'd have to sneak around and watch, turn the volume down and, and watch the game. 'cause he loved the Packers. Right. And when the Packers would, would score a goal, he'd do like this and that.\n\nRight.\n\nAnd so then he tells me that, you know, when he got out and, and other people were, you know, were, were getting out, turns out they were doing the same thing, you know, you know,\n\nWatching the game. Oh, that's so crazy.\n\nBut he has a great story telling about, about the guys from Cameroon.\n\nOh, yeah, yeah. So I had met some embassy people from the, the country of Cameroon in Africa. And they had come out to one of my talks and, and afterwards, you know, they said, you know, I, it was really fascinating and, and America is really far behind on race relations, you know, when we first got here, we didn't realize we were black. And I was like, what? That's are you talking about? I said, we gotta talk, I gotta understand this. What do you mean you didn't realize you are black? And he's like, well, of course we realize we're black, but you see in the United States, you know, or where we're from in Cameroon, we're Cameroonian. You know, that's who we are. Like, you know, we know we're black. But he goes, you know, in the United States it's different.\n\nYou're black American, white American, you know? Yeah.\n\nHe says, we are treated differently in the United States, even by other black people, you know? Oh, we\n\nWere treated\n\nDifferently. So he says, now we know we're black.\n\nWow. I was like, wow.\n\nI took a minute to wrap my mind around that one.\n\nIt's fascinating. Well, it makes sense. They think of themselves as Cameroonian. Yeah. As\n\nAs they should. Yeah.\n\nAs they should. Yes. Yeah. Yep. Wow. Yeah. That's what's crazy when you experience racism from other black people, you're like, whoa. Right.\n\nWell now hold on. Now, you know, or\n\nDiscrimination I should say.\n\nWell, when you, when you experience it from anybody, right. But understand something. Okay. So, you know, we, we have a unique thing here called slavery. And, and Jewish people have a unique thing called the Holocaust. So if you are a white guy and you are walking down down the street, the sidewalk, and some other white guy is coming up the sidewalk, you don't know him, just a stranger. You know, you guys are gonna pass and not say a thing to, to e to to either one. You know, just, just go on by. Right. If it's a black guy, two black guys passing, they don't, they're going, yo man, what's up? They're gonna acknowledge one another because they have a shared experience. They both are descendants of slaves. They both have experienced racism at some point in their life or whatever. If, if two Jews pass who don't know each other, they're gonna go shalom because of that commonality, that experience. Okay. So unless you've had that experience, you don't, you don't react to it. Alright. So when I lived in Africa, on the continent of Africa for 10 years, I lived in Ethiopia, Ghana, Guinea, and Senegal, and visited many other countries in between 'cause of my dad's job. Right. So I can tell you, you know, all black people don't look alike. All black people don't know each other. Alright? And\n\nThat's a funny thing to say too, but you,\n\nBut you, yeah, but you know what, a lot of white people think that they, they do a lot. Yeah. Especially older, older ones. Oh, okay. Now, at one time, in, in a city, all black people probably did know each other. Okay. Because they had to go to the same school and there was only one black school in the town. Right. They couldn't go different white schools. Okay. So, yeah. You know, you, they could only shop in a certain store. They couldn't shop in every store or restaurant. Right. So yeah, they would run into each other more often. But today, you know, no, but the stigma is still there. Okay. The sentiment, especially with older people. So anyway, if I'm walking down the street and I've had this happen and some black guy from Africa is coming up the street, I go, Hey man, what's up? You know, I don't know the guy, he looks at me like, kind of strange. Like, why? I don't know you, why are you talking to me? 'cause he doesn't have that experience. Right?\n\nRight.\n\nSo we're not, you know, we're not, we're not monolithic.\n\nRight? Yeah. Well, that, that this is the only way these movements, like the neo-Nazis work, is if you don't know a lot of people from all over the world and realize we're all just people. Yep. This is, you know, it's, and it is very fear based. Right? Yeah. Because I mean, think about it, you're, you're clinging to the lowest common denominator. You all have a certain amount of melanin in your skin, and you're all from a certain part of the world. That's it. And it's really not a very good commonality. It's bound, it's terrible. Yes. Especially when you think about the differences in personalities and tastes and just how people behave. And it's not a good indicator at all. No. It's the dumbest. It really, it really is. But now there's no bearing on your character, no bearing on your intellect, no bearing on any of the things that we find fascinating and attractive about people. It's just the color of your skin, which is the dumbest fucking thing on earth. Absolutely.\n\nAnd, you know, and, and we all may engage in it somewhat. Like for example, if I like Chinese food and if I go to a Chinese restaurant, I don't wanna see a bunch of white college kids or black college kids for that matter in the kitchen cooking it for me. Right. You know, I want the authentic real deal. Right. You know, so am I being prejudice?\n\nNo, that's not prejudice. That's You wanna experience the culture. The culture. Yeah, exactly. Like if I go to an Italian restaurant, I'm assuming there's gonna be a bunch of old school Italian people back there cooking. You know, I want, I want, I want heavy accents. You know, I want the smell of garlic in the air. You know what I'm saying?\n\nDo you know where Italians came from\n\nOriginally? Yeah. I mean, I'm assuming Italy.\n\nWell, that's what they live.\n\nI mean, what are you trying to say? Well, I,\n\nI'm gonna tell you. Okay. Okay. So Italians came from Africa. They came from the Moors. Oh\n\nYes. Well, Sicily in particular, that's actually where my family's\n\nFrom. Okay. Well there you go. Okay. And they're darker in Sicily Right. Than in Rome and Venice and wherever else. Right, right. The further you move from the equator, the, the darker the skin. Right. Okay. Yeah. The Moors came, you know, and into there where we all evolved from Africa at some point in time, way back when. Right. But you know, a lot of people don't realize that, you know, and they really need to check their DNA and check their history rather than just take it from where they started, where they were born. You know, that's why I think it's so important to not ban books and ban and rewrite history at Oma.\n\nOf course. Yeah, of course. You know, there is some indication that human beings might have come out of Asia as well. In fact, one of the oldest known human skeletons that they found, which predates Lucy. No, it's another one that Lucy. Lucy, well,\n\nLucy is outta Ethiopia.\n\nRight. But Lucy wasn't a homo sapien. They found something that is a homo sapien that's 500,000 years older than when they thought homo sapiens existed. This is very recent. Wow. And so it was likely that this was taking place in multiple areas of the world, just like there's different animals in multiple places of the world. There's different primates in multiple places of the world, and there's a bunch of different kinds of human being of course. Right. There's Dennis VINs, which have just recently discovered. And then there was the, the Hobbit people on the island of Flores. Like there's a lot of, when it comes to the, the evolutionary history of human beings is very, very odd. But when you talk about like the cultural history of human beings, that's when things get really crazy because it was just a lot of people like traveling all over the place and just settling into the climate. And the reason why white people are white is just 'cause there is no sun. It's that simple. And they had to develop essentially like a giant solar panel to suck up vitamin D because they weren't getting any vitamin D from the sun. It's really that simple. And that's when it gets real weird,\n\nWhich has nothing to do with their intelligence or lack thereof. Zero.\n\nZero. You know, it, it's all environmental. And over the course of hundreds of thousands of years, people change their appearance. And you know, when you tell people that, they're like, wait, what? Right. Yeah. We, we all came from the same source. We're all destroy. It destroys, destroys. That's destroys why we could all have babies, you know, like other animals that are very different. Like there's certain fish that can have babies with other fish, but those, those fish become infertile, you know? And then like the, the same with like donkeys. Like donkeys, they don't, they can't have babies. You know, like it's a, or or mules rather can't have babies because it's a, a cross between a donkey and a horse. And you can do it, but then it can't make babies or a liger can't make babies. Right, right. But people can make babies with people obviously. 'cause we're the same fucking thing. Yeah. Right.\n\nAny, any, any culture of people.\n\nYes. Yes. Any culture of people can have babies with other cultures of people. 'cause we all come from the same source kind of wipes out the whole racism argument. Doesn't the stupid, it's the stupidest fucking thing ever because it's adaptive to environment. It's\n\nAlways your DN my DNA, his DNA are 99.9% the same. Yep,\n\nYep,\n\nYep. And that should be taught in elementary school. Yeah. Yes. Don't wait to, to teach it in college when people's minds are already solidified.\n\nYes, yes. Yes. I think that thing too, that exposure that you had to, that Nazi coming to visit you, even though it's negative exposure, it's probably good to see, you know, like when I was a kid, I was in high school when I was 14, Barney Frank, who\n\nOh yeah, I remember him. Yeah.\n\nHe, he wasn't openly gay then, but he was like one of the first openly gay members of Congress. He lived near me. He lived near me as well. I lived in Massachusetts at the time. And he was from Massachusetts, or was representative of Massachusetts. So\n\nWhen he lived in DC as a congressman.\n\nOh, okay. So this was before that, I guess then, so he was debating a member of what at the time was the, I believe it was the moral majority. And it was this really goofy guy who came out and he had like an American flag on his lapel. And I remember I was 14, and you know, when you're 14 and you see someone who's got this very, like, he was very anti-gay marriage, very anti, a lot of things, but he was a clumsy n it wasn't very eloquent, not a very compelling speaker. And then Barney Frank went up, you know, so they both spoke, spoke, this guy spoke, and then Barney Frank and Barney Frank was so much smoother, so much more articulate. He was like, and for every, all the kids that I was in school with who left, they're like, that guy made more sense. Like, this is a good thing to see. It's good that they see someone with a very narrow-minded, bigoted perspective. And then someone who is more intelligent, more has a much better vocabulary, smoother in their ability to disseminate information and to dissect the bad arguments of the other person. So we all walked out of there with like, oh, okay. And then, you know, I remember talking about it with my friends, like, yeah, that guy's a fucking moron. Let first guy, you know, like, and but nowadays, instead of that, you would only get one. You would only get the one person talking. But the one person talking without the other person talking is not as good. And this idea of protecting kids from bad ideas, because they don't want these kids to be indoctrinated by bad ideas. It doesn't work with human beings. The way to get rid of bad ideas is to confront them with better ideas. Exactly. Yep. And the fear of having these kind of debates in schools is really dangerous. It's dangerous for discourse, it's dangerous for the development of the ability to have arguments and ideas, and to be able to debate you, you have to see it done. You have to see bad thinking, good thinking. Ah, I get it. I get it. This guy's, he's more, he's more clever. He's thinking better, he's got more information. This makes sense. Yep. And if you don't allow people to make those distinctions on their own, if you just baby them and treat them like you can't expose them to these negative ideas, you, you miss out on the possibility of accepting nuance and an understanding of how a less sophisticated, less educated person can fall into these traps of these stupid ideologies.\n\nYou just nailed it. Right on. You know, right on the head man. Allowing them to see the difference. Yes. Okay. Because you know, people, how did you change those people? Darrell? No, I didn't change them. They changed themselves. Because we all know one's perception is one's reality. Right. Whatever somebody perceives becomes their reality, even if it's not real, it's their reality. Right. You cannot change their reality. And if you try, you're gonna get resistance. Right. 'cause they, they only know what they know. Right. If you keep trying, it's gonna escalate. You're gonna get loud and keep on trying, it's gonna explode. You, you call, it's gonna be rolling around on the ground, hitting each other or whatever. Right? 'cause all fights start with yelling and screaming. Right. So rather, it is, rather than try to attack somebody's reality and try to set their reality straight, don't do that. You'll fail. What you do is you offer them a better perception or perceptions. Yes. And if they resonate with one of your perceptions, like showing them, this guy speaks very eloquently. That guy speaks like a, like, like a moron. Right. Just let them see it. Yeah. Okay. That perception then resonates with them and they change their own reality. Yeah. So don't focus on how you're gonna change somebody's reality. Focus on what kind of perceptions can I offer that person that might resonate. Right?\n\nRight. And just by example, but who by who you are. Because when people see someone speak and it resonates with them and see someone speak and they, you can sense how they think of things. You can see the thought process and you go, well, who do I admire more? I admire this guy. He is like, he's, he's thinking like, this is a, an enlightened person. This is a person who's thinking in a way that I want to be able to think like that. Especially as a young kid, you know, you don't wanna be a moron when you see someone you think is a moron. You're like, okay, I'm glad I saw that guy because that guy looks like a fucking idiot. Now this guy, oh, that guy makes more sense. You know?\n\nWell, you know, when, when Jeff and I were in that Christmas grill and he felt he was getting along too well with the enemy being me, and he started beating his fist on the table.",

When\n\nAre you bailing outta your country? It's sinking that, that is the fucking Titanic. And you are one of the last deckhands.\n\nWe're gonna, we're gonna stand and fight, man. Yeah.\n\nAre\n\nYou really?\n\nYeah. Good\n\nLuck. No, we are. Good\n\nLuck. We're the guys playing\n\nAs long as it's still okay. They're\n\nArrest you for saying stand and fight. It is a excitement of violence.\n\nYeah.\n\nYeah, yeah. No, but it's got, it's interesting. I mean, obviously you had Graham Linehan on the show. We are gonna have him on as well soon to talk about it. But he, his, they're not gonna prosecute him. And not only that, they also said they are not going to investigate noncrime hate incidents anymore. Do you know what those\n\nAre? Oh, interesting.\n\nIt's basically when you've committed no crime, but you're still like hateful.\n\nOh, okay. But that's also very subjective too.\n\nYeah, of course. Of course. So they're not, they're not gonna investigate them anymore. Yeah. But they're still gonna keep track of them is what they said.\n\nOh, keep track. Just, we've got an eye on you. We're gonna make,\n\nWe're gonna make a record of it, but won't investigating. So\n\nAre they gonna stop arresting people for social media posts then?\n\nWhat do you think, Joe? I think,\n\nNo,\n\nI think it's\n\nProfitable.\n\nI think that's,\n\nWell, yeah. It's probably a nice fine. Right? What do you get? You get a fine.\n\nI don't think it's about that. I think, you know, during the, the uber woke era, they put all these laws on the stature book, and the police have to enforce the law. Right. They have no choice. 'cause if a bunch of people complain and then they don't investigate the people that have been reported. Oh,\n\nThat's\n\nWhat it's all about. They get in trouble. Of course. Like if you, the ordinary, like, you know, police officers, right. Police officers don't like enforcing these dumb laws. Of course. It's put on them from above. Yeah.\n\nI just didn't know that all that stuff was put in place in your country during the woke era.\n\nYeah, it was.\n\nAnd the heavy rope, it's almost like a fever dream, you know, when you really go back and pay attention to some of the more insane woke stuff from like, just five years ago. Yeah. Like everyone was losing their fucking mind. It. But like, if I was an elite, if I was one of those lizard people running the world, I'd have been like, well, look here, this is really interesting. Like, this was just a cold, it was just a cold and a little bit of social media input. And we got these people behaving in a way that they'd never behaved before. Admitting to things they'd never admitted to before. Adhering to rules. It never existed before.\n\nYeah. I, I think the thing that I found the most, the, the worst bit about, it wasn't necessarily the behavior of the elites, it was the behavior of ordinary people during that time. Yeah. The fact that your neighbor was so willing to snitch on you because you went for a second walk.\n\nWell, that's why I was interested in it as a lizard person. If I was a lizard person elite, I'd be like, look, these people are dumb. Like, this is really easy to manipulate. Especially, I was just talking to a buddy of mine who's fleeing LA and he was like, I can't anymore. I tried. I just fucking, I hung in there. I can't do it anymore. It's like everybody went crazy. Mm. It's like, it, there's something that happened because of the pandemic and the Black Lives Matter protests and the riots and all the ca It just cha like, whatever the temperature of society was is like, it hit societal global warming where it's like, it's time to investigate Greenland. It's time to move north. Like this is a bad climate now. This sucks. Mm.\n\nAnd LA is a perfect example of this. 'cause we talk about this all the time. You get outta the airport at LAX, you feel that la sun on your skin and you just go, this is paradise. Yeah. It's the, the whole. And then you walk out and you see this, it's paradise. And they fucked it up so bad that people will literally pack up and leave paradise.\n\nWhat Donald Trump should do is when he leaves the office run for governor of California, they just take over California and fix it. It would be hilarious if he did. It would be one of the funniest things of all time. If an 82-year-old man steps into the office of governor of California, we're gonna fix everything. You've got a problem with water. I know how to get the water. It would be fucking hilarious. But\n\nIt's almost like there. So there's a very old joke about Venezuela, where God was creating Venezuela, and he was like, you know what I'm gonna do? I'm gonna make sure they have diamonds, they have gold, they have desert, but they also have jungle. They have beautiful beaches. It's gonna be rich in oil and the whole, and then, well, the entire world goes, Hey, that's unfair. Like, they've gotta have something bad. And God goes, yeah, you know what? You're right. Let's give them the Venezuelans. And that's almost like that with California. You're like, California's too perfect. You know what I mean? It's got everything you need. Right? So what are you gonna do? You've gotta give them something fucked up. And it's just these crazy people who believe in these stupid ideas. But\n\nIt wasn't for a long time. Mm. I mean, you gotta realize Arnold was the governor of California. Mm. Right? And then, you know, Ronald Reagan's from California. He was the governor of California at one time. He too, it wasn't always that nuts. And when you went back to when I went there in the 1990s, it was much more moderate politically. Hmm. Like, you know, people were definitely left leaning, but it wasn't a focus. It wasn't a thing that was discussed all the time. It would just, it wasn't. And I remember working with many, like older actors who were openly conservative. No one cared. It was just like, oh, this is Bob. You know, he's really into Bob Dole. Like, you know, it wasn't, it wasn't unusual. Something happened around the Obama administration. Something happened specifically around his second term that really changed everything. And if you look at like, internet, like searches and use of certain words, especially racism. Yes. It flies. It just hits a\n\nGiant leap. Right? 2014. Yes. 2014. Right around\n\nThen.\n\nYeah. Yeah. And it's not just in America. It's literally everywhere in the world. Yeah. That's why I think it's social media that's caused that.\n\nA hundred percent. It's social media and it's, it's, there's a, there's a bunch of factors. But the problem is now that the genie's outta the bottle, they know how easy we are to manipulate. And I don't think people are learning. They're toing all day long, and they're just like getting blasted with all this negativity and strife and global conflict and Colombian assassinations. That's what I get a, a lot of these assassinations in like cafes. Someone pulls up on a scooter, bang, bang, and they drive off and everybody screams. I've seen a hundred thousand of those I've seen. You know, it's like, everybody's like completely ramped up. And at the same time, you've got people in the UK getting arrested for Facebook posts about immigration.\n\nSo I think part of the problem is, is that people, when they go on these posts, they're not looking for to learn something, as you just said, what they actually want is an emotional reaction. They want to feel something, right. If you live in a society where it's comparatively the easiest it's ever been, and your life is boring. 'cause all you do is get up, you go to work, you go, you have food, you commute, you come back. It's essentially a treadmill where you don't feel any of the ups and downs of emotion. Right. Then what way would you get that? But by going online and seeing something fucking awful happening, you feel terror, you feel sadness, you feel rage. At it's most basic, you feel alive.\n\nWell, it's also just, that's what you're gonna watch. You know? And so you're getting sucked into it just because of the algorithm, which is crazy. We no one ever considered algorithms before. We considered access to information, but we didn't consider that information be curated to hold your attention span. Mm. And all these factors have not been studied. Well, you know, there's been a few guys like Jonathan Haight writing about a few scholars that are really attempting to like, say, Hey, what is a, what's a sociological and what, what are the, what is the long term consequences of this happening? Also for children? These are the first children in the, in human history, growing up on social media, never been done before. We don't know what that's like, like what is it gonna change in terms of empathy, in terms of hostility, acceptance of violence, which is a completely brand new thing on the left. Acceptance and celebration of gun violence never happened before. When I was a kid, it never existed. No one from the left ever celebrated anybody getting assassinated, ever. It just wasn't a thing.\n\nIt's so crazy, man. And you're talking about like language as well? Like we have this, we have the leader of the Green Party in the uk, new guys coming through. He's very popular with people on the left, on, on that side of the left. Anyway. And it's been, what, how long has it been since Charlie Kirk was assassinated? Like a month. Yeah. Right. And he's running around calling like, not, not far. Right. People just like Nigel Farage is a Nazi, is a fascist. And you're just, and you're going, you and I, and we've discussed this so many times with you, man. It's like when you call people these words, like if you and I and Francis thought the Nazis were here to take over, we'd all fight them. Hmm. So what do you expect people to do when you put you are put in the target? This\n\nEpisode is brought to you by the farmer's dog.

And you're doing it in just for political persuasion, power. That's really all. It's, that's what it's, it's like no one really believes Nigel Farage is a fucking Nazi. He's kind of goofy, but he's not a Nazi. Like the what is a Nazi then. And that here's the real problem. This is what nobody wants to admit. If you are in Nazi Germany and you're a 20-year-old man and you're German, and everyone in your town is a Nazi, you are probably a Nazi too. Or you're Jew and you're running Mm Yeah. You're running from these motherfuckers. So either you're a Jew or you're a Nazi, you're either Jewish or you're, you're a fucking evil part of history that everybody refers to as the worst people of all time.\n\nAbsolutely. And you know, we're talking That's\n\nScary.\n\nYeah. That, but it's human nature. Sorry, Francis. It's just we interviewed David Buss yesterday. You've had him on, right? Mm, yes. Evolutionary. I mean, he, he, this is one of the things he talked about is like, within us is the ability we have good adaptations and we have evil adaptations. Yeah. And if you put people in the certain context, and those adaptations are in all of us.\n\nYeah. Donner party. People eat people. Yeah. Yeah. You get get down to, I might die or I might eat somebody. You eat people. Yeah. The guy's already dead. We should just eat them. And then you all sit around and go, oh my God, are we really gonna eat a person? And then you're eating a person, like everybody does. They all have very few people just starve to death when you could just eat a person who's already dead.\n\nAnd it's, you know, Zach Polanski, what he does is, to me, this is the\n\nGreen party guy.\n\nThe green party guy is completely wrong. But then there are people on the far left. So there's a member parliament called Zara. Tana. Yes. That is her real name. Zara Tana. And yeah,\n\nShe sounds like a boss in a video game.\n\nYeah.\n\nWell,\n\nWhat's really interesting is she has, she put a clip on her social media where she goes and she set up this new far left political party. And she says, we've gotta fight Fasci in parliament. We gotta fight them in the ballot box. And you're going, all right, look, I don't like the, the rhetoric. And then she says something even more interesting and we've gotta fight them in the streets. Now you think to yourself, right, if you classify Nigel Farage and the people who vote reform in the uk, which may well win the general election, which may well be the biggest political party and already represents a sizable portion of the uk, you are effectively advocating violence. And it's incitement to violence as far as I'm concerned. But because she's on the far less, she's deemed to be a good person, that's somehow okay. Whereas if Nigel said something like that along those lines, you know, that people would be like, this is a fascist, this is evil, this is disgusting. You shouldn't say that.\n\nYou are also weaponizing mental illness. 'cause one of the things that we know now very clearly, because of all these YouTube videos, all these people that go to these protests and start interviewing folks, some of these people are clearly not well. And this is the thing they've attached themselves to. This is their tribe. This is whether it's no kings or fuck ice or whatever, whatever the tribe is, this is their tribe now. And the, they're schizophrenic or their, you know, fill in the blank, whatever the mental illness is, and you're weaponizing them by calling these people who just differ with you politically or more conservative. You're calling these people the enemy of humanity. Mm. It's very\n\nScary. It is. Right. And you know, I'm one of the people that has gone along to a lot of protests. There's a lot of wild people there.\n\nOh yeah. You've done some great interviews at those protests. Mm, yeah. It's just when they're confronted with a person who's actually asking them questions, it's remarkable how few people know why they're there. Mm. They don't, they don't know. Like when you get into specifics, this guy did this thing today where he was talking with people, the No Kings Pro.",

      "transcript_chunk": "ng people to protest, and if there's documentation that the metadata from the cell phones are the same from protest to protest, and that they're traveling on buses that's paid for with tax dollars. Like, hold on. What are you really doing? What are you really doing? This isn't really an organic protest. That's right. You funneled money through an NGO and now you are hiring people to show up and wave signs to give the illusion look at, this is what they did during the Kamala Harris campaign. They filled up stadiums with people coming to see her. And the same people went from stadium to, it became a job. It became a job, but it gave the illusion. So that's deception. That's deception. And that should not be legal. That should not be a legal thing to do. You're engaging in propaganda. You know, you're, you're openly manipulating people's perspective. Ba you know, you're paying these, those aren't audience members. Those are cl those are customers. That's right. You're paying them. Yeah.\n\nAnd what, what, what is your take? What is it that they want When they say no kings, they, they, what do they want? They think\n\nDonald Trump is behaving like a king.\n\nHow so?\n\nBecause, well, he ran on a platform and was elected and won every swing state and the popular vote. And then once he got in, he did exactly what he said he was gonna do, which is exactly\n\nWhat a king does.\n\nMakes.\n\nAnd then he let them protest, which is also what a king does, right? Yeah. Like, no, no. He didn't send the troops to stop the protest. In fact, he congratulated them on doing a great job. And I'm, and he said, I'm still your president. Yeah.\n\nI saw that\n\nTweets fucking hilarious. Yeah. It's very funny. It's a very funny, like, pull up is the tweet that he made. I guess it's not a tweet. It's like, which I still say tweet. I tried.\n\nIt's a truth.\n\nIt's a, I tried X for a while and I can't say it. I say Twitter,\n\nIt's still a tweet. I\n\nMight say X, but you tweeted. That's right. You know, and if it's truth social, it's gonna make its way to Twitter. And then it's a tweet. Yeah. Yeah. It's like can't you can't ret truth something that doesn't even make any sense.\n\nYou know, the thing that we have in this country, I dunno if you have it in this country as much, is just the, the way the policing is biased. The way that they will arrest Graham Linehan for three relatively innocuous tweets. One of them was a joke and they will arrest him the moment he lands on British soil. Five police officers. You, you get other people saying he heinous things. Or you get, like I said, the example Zara Saltana saying, you know, we're gonna fight them in the streets. Right. But that's fine. Right. And nothing comes from that. That's\n\nRidiculous. Well, no, there was a guy who was at a protest.\n\nI'm looking at his, I don't know which\n\nAccount it was on. He, he was a, he, he was a member of political party.\n\nI think you could probably find an image of it. 'cause it was posted everywhere.\n\nThere was a guy called, I think his name was Ricky Jones. He said at a protest, we need to slit the throats of the far right. Oh, great. And he was found not guilty.\n\nOh great. And Graham Lenihan gets arrested. Right. Ay, what are they trying to do to England? It was always such a lovely place to visit.\n\nWell, this is what I was gonna ask you. I wish more people in Britain recognize how fucking crazy this looks to the rest of the world. Oh, well you guys must be looking at us going, what the fuck is this?\n\nWe can't believe it. We literally can't believe it. When I tell people that don't know that 12,000 people this year were arrested in Britain for posting things on social media. Their, their jaw drops. Like what? I go, dude, they're going crazy over there. Like, you have to pay attention. You have to pay attention. 'cause this kinda shit is contagious. And if it gets into Germany and then it gets into Spain or it gets into other countries, like it can become a real fucking problem. Like, then you have full on military dictatorship in England. 'cause that's what it always leads to. It. 100% leads to military dictatorship. Yeah. If you're telling people they can't do things and you're trying to install socialism and then you get it in place, there's only one way to keep it in place. You gotta use the fucking army. That's the only way you gotta get men with guns to tell people you can only make so much money. You have to give away this. We're gonna take that. We're the only ones, ones who grow food. We're the only ones who do this. We're gonna sign you a job. Like you fucked up. You fell into the, the age old trap that's been exposed by history over and over and over again. And people are like, we're gonna do it right this time. And they got blue hair and a fucking mask on and a cat t-shirt. And they're morbidly obese and they're just marching down the street. And we're gonna let them run the country like England, which used to run like most of the fucking world. One island of savages ran most of the world. And now you're getting an overrun with nonsense and you're arresting people for saying, Hey, maybe we shouldn't have rape gangs. You know, maybe, maybe we shouldn't, maybe we shouldn't tolerate lawlessness in the streets.\n\nOh, absolutely. I mean, it got so ridiculous in the UK that the Supreme Court had to get involved to make a decision whether boys had PPEs and girls have Fus,\n\nPPEs and Fus. That's an interesting way to put it.\n\nYeah. That's it. But, but the reason I'm using that language is just to highlight how,\n\nHow silly it is. How\n\nCompletely ridiculous it is.\n\nThat's crazy. Well, how about when they asked when Supreme Court Justice Kaji Brown Jackson was being sworn in when they were talking to her during the confirmation part, they asked her, what is a woman? And she's like, I'm not a biologist. Like, but you're a actual woman. Right? Like, who? I believe she has children, right? Mm. So she's a woman who's given birth. You know exactly what a woman is like. This is not But they\n\nDon't fucking know though. I\n\nKnow's what's crazy. That's what's crazy. They're playing this game. They're\n\nPlaying the game. Yeah.\n\nYeah.\n\nThey're playing the game. But, but these aren't like inconsequential people. No Supreme Court justice. I know. Playing this game, playing\n\nThe dumbest game that's ever been played. It's the dumbest And it's weird, man. It's a weird game. You know, it's a weird game. Like, what is a woman like here's the, here's the real funny part. No one asks what is a man? And no one gives a fuck if you're a woman and you pretend to be a man. 'cause you're not gonna victimize men. That's the dirty little thing that they're covering up about All this is you're opening up the door to people that now have a Willy Wonka golden ticket to pretend that they're a woman and be around women, and then dominate women's spaces, and dominate women's sports, and dominate all kinds of things that women are involved in just with their personalities. Like the overbearing fucking shitty male personalities over overbearing and, and taking over women's groups. Yeah. It's fucking nuts. And if you're, and if you're not them, then you're, if you don't support that, then you're a turf. And they're like, we could shoot turfs. And then there's like punch a turf and, and, and they think that because they're a woman, it's okay for this woman, this trans woman to do violence on a biological woman, which is like bananas. Yeah. Like now, now we're, now we're allowing men to beat up women because they say they're a woman. It's just two women fighting. Well, no, that's not, that's not what that is at all. This is, you just did something that's completely insane and it's a giant chunk of the population that accept that. And if you say something about it, then you're transphobic or you're, you're hateful or you're a part of the patriarchy or whatever. Fill in the blank. Whatever the problem is. But like, you're not addressing that. You open the door to one specific group. That's always been the most horrible group in our society. It's creepy, pervert men that wanna fucking prey on women. And now you're letting them into the locker room and you don't have a solution to that. So you just don't want me talking about it. That's the weird part. 'cause no one gives a fuck about trans men going in the bathroom. You wanna go in the bathroom and pee next to me? Who cares? You, you want me to tell you want me to call you Bob now? Bob? Okay. I'm fine with, it doesn't, you're not taking anything from men. Mm. You're not taking anything. You're not inserting yourself into that world and dominating it. You're just, you know, you're LARPing\n\nWell, they don't wanna admit that there's sometime sometimes a conflict between the rights of different groups. Right. They wanna pretend that it's just about empathy. And you can have, but you can't, you can't simultaneously have empathy for women as you are describing. And also for people who want to be the, the opposite sex in a women's bathroom. Those two things are in direct conflict. Direct, direct conflict. And you are gonna have to come out for one side or the other. It would\n\nBe one thing if that was never an issue. That there were never men that ever did anything negative to women. If there was no rape ever, it was never done. It was impossible. If no one ever did it, then you would go, well this is just a non-issue. It's just a place where you wash your hands. But it's not a place where you wash your hands. It's a place where you go to the bathroom. Yeah. And there's prison changed prisons. It's prisons. Prisons. Prisons. Yeah. People who are violent against women say they're a woman. They get put in women's prisons where they rape women. That's been done. Yeah. Yeah. Like, like it made its way that far down the ladder. And like the aliens are probably like waiting to show us the gravity drive. They're like right about to like, no, no. Look what they're doing. Yeah. They're not ready yet. Their brains aren't cooked yet. We're still adolescents. Champions are made and legends are tested as UFC 3 21 brings Tom Aspenal versus Cyril gn to the world and DraftKings Sports book.

But you\n\nKnow what's really fascinating is a cognitive dissonance that these people have. 'cause on the one hand they would say that we live in a patriarchal rape culture where women are subjugated and oppressed and you know, and how awful it is for women. And then on the other hand, they're like, yeah, right Derek, you now say you're a woman right on this way.\n\nBut they see, they get past that with trans women or women. They just say it trans women or women and that's it. And it's like the discussion's over Mm. It's like, okay, are you sure? Are you fucking sure? You know, like maybe some of them are Mm. Like do you don't think there's any perverts left? They all got absorbed into the community and reformed. Like what happened? What happened to the guy from Silence of the Lambs? You know, what happened to Ed Gain? He's, you know, this ed gain documentary on Netflix. Have you guys watched any of it? No, it's not a documentary. I should say it's a docudrama with that heartthrob fellow, what's that guy's name? Who plays Ed Gain? He's really good man. It's really creepy. But a lot of it deals with Autogynephilia where Ed Gain used to wear his mom's clothes and he would jack off. And then he started, after his mom died, he tried to dig his mom up. He couldn't dug somebody else up, brought her back, skinned her, started wearing her clo wearing her skin, and then started killing women and wearing their skin first he started robbing graves and then cutting up them and turning their, their skin into furniture and all kinds of shit. And, but trans communities are complaining about this because the fact that he was a cross-dressing psychopath, it puts them in danger. A true story about a guy who was really into dressing up like women and wearing their skin. Like that puts them in danger. Like, you know, Netflix did a bad thing by talking about a real event that actually happened. A real fucking crazy person who's one of the worst serial killers in the history of this country.\n\nIt's you, you have, the one thing I will say about the UK in the UK's defense is that we looked, we have, I think we've turned the corner with this stuff. Well\n\nYou stopped the gender surgeries before anybody. Yes.\n\nAnd And the puberty blockers and the puberty blockers,\n\nPub blockers. I meant gender surgery surgeries for\n\nYoung kids. Yeah. And that was as a result of the CAS report. Now the CAS report was conducted by a lady called Dr. Hillary Cass, who's one of the most prominent pediatricians in the uk. And it was an independent report funded by the conservative government at the time. But when she published that report, she was said there is no evidence, zero evidence that puberty blockers actually help or alleviate distress in children who say that they're gender dysphoric. So, and to be fair to the labor government at the time, the labor government, now they actually banned puberty blockers and whatever else. But you just go, why did we have to go through this process? Why did, oh look, we're finally, we're getting there. But this is something which we all know to be true apart from a small number of demented people.\n\nYou know what a puberty blocker initially was used for? Right.\n\nNo\n\nChemical castration. So same drugs they used to give sex offenders to chemically castrate.\n\nReally?\n\nYeah. Same drugs.\n\nWow.\n\nYeah. And they just repurposed it and changed what they call it. You know, they deal with a lot of drugs. That's what they did with ivermectin. Same kind of thing. Yeah.\n\nThat's that's wild. And then it's really wild.\n\nYou wanna hear something even more wild.\n\nGo\n\nOn. Michael Jackson's doctor claims that that's what his father did to him. And that completely makes sense to me because Michael Jackson, when he was young, had a fucking insane talent. Like insane. Hmm. He was so good. And his voice was so, and they were so huge and his father was so overbearing that I could imagine a world where he would decide like, what's the way to keep his voice the way it is? And you'd use puberty blockers. Make him a castrato basically. Exactly. Make him a castrato. Fuck. Yeah. And I think that's what they did. But that's what, if you look at his body, it shows no sign of testosterone. Right. He's just all limbs. Right. Whereas his brothers, you ever see his brothers? No. They're thick. They look like athletes. Like all of them look like thick men. And Michael is like a stick. Right. Right. And he always had that high pitched voice and he was always able to sing like a raa.",

      "transcript_chunk": "where they had to kill it because it was killing all these cows. And they had stumbled upon this one calve that had gotten right before they got to it. It eviscerated this calve and it, it was still alive and it had eaten some of its organs and they had to kill the calve. And then they're like hunting for this mountain lion and he has a video of him shooting this thing. Dogs chase it up a tree and then he shoots it with a bow and arrow. And then he had it stuffed here and he ate it.\n\nDo you aim, you aim for the heart or the head?\n\nYeah. You aim for the heart and the lungs, whatever is available depending on the position of the mountain lion's arm. Right. Like if the arm is like right here, you wanna, you want to tuck it right behind the shoulder and you're gonna get double lungs. And if the arm is up here, you gonna either get the heart or the lungs depending on where their arm is or whether or not you have a, but that's powerful enough to go through the arm and into the body cavity.\n\nIs there a risk, 'cause maybe this is like an urban myth, but if you hurt, hurt an animal, but you don't kill it, it will come back. Some of them will come back to fuck you up like a kind of revenge movie. No,\n\nJohn Wick of animals.\n\nYeah. I imagine they just run away. They\n\nRun away. Well, it's wild like deer that have survived with an arrow in their body cavity. There was a, a deer skeleton that they found of a deer that they, that someone a hunter killed eventually. And this thing had a arrow that had gone through its body and had turned all into bone. So bone had taken over this arrow and the, the whole ca, there it is. That's what it looked like. Wow.\n\nWow.\n\nIsn't that crazy? Mm. So you could see the broadhead had embedded itself in one of the ribs. And so not only did the deer survive, but its body adapted and grew around the arrow.\n\nWow. Wow. Actually, the reason I said that about the nuts. That is insane about the animal was I know that COVID, particularly crows can remember. They can remember. Oh yeah. And then there's been instances where people have hurt crows and the crows phone away. And then a group of them have attacked the person.\n\nOh yeah. They're really smart. They're, they're super and ravens, I think that are, they're actually different than crows. And they're even smarter than crows. Do you know there's a parrot Who was that parrot? That brave parrot? Yeah. Who told us about that? Who was that the other day? Was that Palmer? Palmer Lucky? I think so. I think\n\nSo. Oh, is that the dude with the helmet? Yes. Holy shit. That helmet, bro.\n\nBro, that helmet's nuts. That helmet's nuts. This guy, that guy was, every now and then I get to sit down with someone and they start talking. I go, whoa, he, this guy's fucking crazy smart. Like weirdly smart. Like, oh, okay, I got it. I got it. Like, tell me what you're doing. And he was telling us about this parrot that actually would speak like a human toddler and new colors, new numbers. Could say things could and would communicate\n\nAfrican gray. Yeah, yeah. Yeah. African grays. They have a, they, they can have the IQ of a 4-year-old child. That\n\nIs nuts. Yeah. When you see this thing talking, you're like, yeah.\n\nAnd their imitation of sounds is like\n\nPerfect. Dead\n\nOn. Yeah. Dead on. Yeah.\n\nBut you have to be around them all the time.\n\nRight, right, right. You\n\nHave a twin that you gotta take with you everywhere you go. Yeah.\n\nReally? Because they just get pulled and fuck, fuck. You can fuck shit up.\n\nAnd then they, they're too smart. They actually start like chopping their own wings off and shit like that. Yeah. They get depressed because they don get stimulation depress, they get depressed. They really need a lot of stimulation. Really? Yeah. They're like humans. I thought about owning app para, but I just traveled too much. Yeah. You\n\nDon't know. You don't want that in your life. That's too much work.\n\nIt's, it's a commitment. Yeah. If\n\nYou leave it alone, it would be sad too. Yeah.\n\nBut that's what I'm saying. Yeah. They\n\nGet mad. I had a buddy of mine who had a parrot and when he would leave it, he would come home and start screaming, where the fuck were you? Like, he wasn't really saying that, but it was like, that was what it was saying. Yeah. It was, was screaming.\n\nWhy get married when you've got that? Right.\n\nYeah. And then he had to, upon coming home, immediately take it out and take it out and like put it on his shoulder. Right. Or put it in his hand. And if you put it down for a second it would start getting pissed off. It's crazy. I'm like, dude, he goes, I know it's a lot. He goes, I didn't think it was gonna be this much. It was like, it was a lot of work. Yeah.\n\nJoe, I'm not, hope I'm not being polite. Have you got any of those cigars where all we smoke? I would love a cigar.\n\nLet's go baby.\n\nIt's a weird thing to ask to be. These are really good. I should have said, if you offer us a cigar, we'll accept one. Come on man.\n\nPlease. Thanks, brother. We have a big ass humid door. There is a, oh, I\n\nDidn't bring my light out\n\nOver there. Some here. Right here.\n\nOh, bonobo chimps are very interesting like that as well.\n\nThey're the weirdest, right? Because they just fuck all the time. This might, might need some juice. Let me give you a little juice.\n\nGo\n\nFor it. They're weird because it's like, okay, so chimps can be either hippies or they can be, you know, like the worst barbarians in human history. Well, it's\n\nLike us.\n\nJust like us. Yeah. That's what's weird. 'cause like, but also the bonobos, like they don't have any, they have one rule. The rule is the mom won't fuck the son. That's it. It's\n\nA good rule. So yeah. It's a good fucking rule man. But they're a\n\nBunch of sister fuckers. They're a bunch of sister fuckers and daughter fuckers. Yeah.\n\nBut they're not motherfuckers. They're\n\nProbably dad fuckers too. They're probably fucking, they're probably doing gay sex too. They, they, they seem wild. They're just having a good time. But\n\nThey, so they're homophobic.\n\nNo, not at all. And they solve all their problems with that. Do\n\nYou need to cut these ones? Yeah. How do\n\nYou It opens like a door.\n\nOh, alright.\n\nRight here. And then you pull those.\n\nBut you know they can learn sign language. Oh yeah.\n\nYou know what's interesting though? They don't ask questions.\n\nSo they're like men. Ah.\n\nBut the parrot did.\n\nThe parrot did. Yeah.\n\nThe parrot asked questions. The parrot had some questions about how things work.\n\nThe African grays are incredibly intelligent. Yeah. Incredibly intelligent.\n\nWell, what I'm interested in is what happens when we can start really decoding dolphin language with ai. Right. And once they really understand what they're saying, then things are gonna get very strange.\n\nLight it. And\n\nYou know, because like, what are they, did they, I mean they're really smart, like silly smart. Like dolphins have enormous frontal lobes.\n\nOh yeah. Man. And communication. They\n\nHave dialects. They have,\n\nThey have dialects. Yeah.\n\nThey sound different. Different\n\nParts of the world. That makes sense. I mean that makes sense. Right? The different, slightly different.\n\nWell, on that note, you think, what about whales? Yeah. Whales brains are literally bigger than us. Yeah. They're, they're enormous. So if we're talking about brain size equals I, which I'm\n\nIt's brain size relative to body master. Yeah.\n\nOh is it? Yeah.\n\nYeah. Because you need a big fucking brain to run a big body. Yeah. Right,\n\nRight. Which is also the argument for why the Neanderthals might have been dumber than us.\n\nWell they were from\n\nWhat we think. They don't know that though. Really? Yeah. They had pretty big brains. What's weird about them is they also had language. Yeah. They had writing and or they had, they definitely had tool making. They had\n\nWriting Don't, I don't think they had\n\nWriting. Writing. No, they didn't have writing. They had language. But they, they did do art. That's what it is. Mm. Wasn't writing necessarily, but they drew stuff and they had a brain that's bigger than ours. But they were also like jacked. They had bigger eyeballs. There was a guy that, this was a, there was a crazy theory that I'm sure is horseshit, but it was cool. Like he made Neanderthals look way different. This guy had a theory like, 'cause we're just, we've never seen a live neanderthal. And he was like, what if we are getting it totally wrong? And what if they were more gorilla looking\n\nThan, but we have the skulls and skeletons down\n\nThere. We have some stuff and they also think they have red hair. This guy was, it's a cracked theory. Right, right. But it was a fun theory. But one of the more fun aspects of this guy's crack theory was that their eyeballs are so much bigger than ours. Their sockets are really big. He's like, what if they have night vision like a deer or like a wolf, you know? Which is totally possible for a primate to have. It's not like, it's not like there's anything about being that kind of a mammal that would exclude you from being able to develop night vision eyesight. Are\n\nThere, are there primates that have that?\n\nI don't\n\nKnow because there's mammals for sure. Yeah.\n\nBut what, yeah, let's ask, let's ask perplexity. Perplexity.\n\nIs\n\nThere any, what is that called? When they have night vision when animals are nocturnal and they could see well at night, you know that thing that like when you're driving and you're see\n\nA fox or something? Yeah,\n\nYeah, yeah. The reflective eyes that they all have. Yeah.\n\nYeah. What is that? I don't, what's\n\nThat called? I dunno. I dunno.\n\nWe should know.\n\nDo you know there's a very interesting theory about ne neanderthals and homo sapiens is there are some people who think that we are one of the few species or one of the only species that has a capacity to deceive Oh and trick. So there was, there's a, there's a theory going around that, that\n\nThe monkeys do that monkeys trick other monkeys into thinking there's an eagle coming. So they steal fruit. Do\n\nThey? Yeah. That's interesting.\n\nThey yell out the sound for eagle and then all the monkeys run away and then they steal the fruit.\n\nOh really? Yeah. Wow.\n\nSo here it is. Monkey primates, the tarsier and the night monkey al monkey are the species with the best vision adapted to night conditions. Right. Okay. So they do. Yeah. See, look at that largest eyes relative to body size of any mammal. So it's something about having a large eye. Because if you, okay. So despite lacking a tape, ofum lucidum, the reflective layer that cause eye shine in many nocturnal animals. Oh, that's what that is. The retina is containing extremely high density of rod photoreceptors, which are highly sensitive to dim light. This allows tarsiers to detect and track prey such as insects in near darkness. And they can see in light as low as 0.001 lux. Similar to moonless nights. Damn. So there's a bunch of different little primates. Oh,\n\nLori's.\n\nBut why, I mean, if you were living in a time, especially if you didn't have fire, if you're living in a time where, you know, there's no roofs, like you're, you're, you're hunting, you're outside at night, you're probably spending as much time as you can hunting. 'cause Neanderthals weren't gatherers, they weren't farmers. So all they did was hunt. Mm. So they probably had some sort of night vision, which would've wild.\n\nYeah. The thing that I find interesting is what is there, I think there's certain, the average person in Europe has around 3% Neanderthal,\n\nDNAD,\n\nNAD three, 3% a if you are African zero. Right. So it's, it's just really interesting. And you see some people, and they're more, they kind of have more than neanderthal kind of appearance too.\n\nYeah, for sure.\n\nAnd then other people. And you go, what, what does that actually give you that 3%? What does it do? Is there any discernible difference whatsoever? Does it make you perhaps more athletic, more re more resilient?\n\nIt's a good question. I mean, I think it would depend. I mean there's also a bunch of other weird strains of human that existed that there, you know, like Dennis Ovs and there's, there's quite a few other ones. Yeah,\n\nYeah.\n\nYeah. You know, who knows what if, I think the Dennis Ovs, I think they definitely got into the gene pool too. I forget who they were saying had a high levels of Dennis Ov DNA, it might have been aboriginal Australians. Hmm. But you know, there's, there was a bunch of different types of human, you know, we just figured out how to be the kiest and the most conniving. And I think probably the most clever,\n\nWell, harra, have you read the Sapiens? His thesis is we, we worked out how to work together beyond the 150 done by number. That was his, his idea is basically we created these shared myths. Religion, money, whatever nation, all of the stuff that we all agree is real that, you know, it feels real. Right. But we, the reason we out-competed other species is that we could cooperate across beyond our immediate tribal group. And that's the reason. That\n\nMakes sense. That makes sense. I mean, there's also, human beings have a very distinct desire to make better things all the time. And if you have that and you're applying that to weapons, you're gonna make the best weapons. Right. You know, I don't know if Neanderthals had that. You know, did they have, I mean, if you're gonna make stuff, right? If you're gonna make tools, you must have some creativity and some desire to innovate. And\n\nCuriosity.\n\nYeah. Curiosity, desire to innovate. 'cause we know that, look, there's certain animals that will use weapons. Right. There's certain, like there's a, a famous photograph of an orangutan that's spearfishing. Have you ever seen that? Yeah. Photo. Mm. But it learned how to do it from people and you know, they'll use rocks to break open crabs and they'll do stuff like that. But they're not fastening an arrowhead No. On a stick or a spear. And they're making it with flint. The inter halls did that. So they got to a level where they're like, okay, this is like craftsmanship. Like this is sophisticated craftsmanship. And it would also probably indicate some sort of a complex language that you could explain where you get the, the gut that you turn into fiber that you use to tie the arrowhead to the stick. Like they were, they were doing, they was doing some high level stuff. Yeah.\n\nFor,\n\nSorry,\n\nGo ahead. For a primate.\n\nYeah. I would imagine also a lot of the innovation comes once you have the greater revolution because there's now surplus food. Yeah. And so you can afford to have a bunch of guys sitting around, not hunting, but like thinking about shit or inventing things or you know, making things in a different way. You know?\n\nDid you see that discovery of a skull that was 500,000 years older than they thought was the origin of human beings? So that it potentially pushes back the original homosapiens to 500,000 years? No.\n\nEarlier.\n\nIs that real? Yeah.\n\nYeah. They think it's, it might push back the date. I mean it's an under debate I'm sure. But I think they might push back the date of the rival of homo sapiens to a million years.\n\nWow.\n\nYeah.\n\nBut it just shows, you know, it's nuts. How,\n\nThis is just nuts.\n\nHow little do we know about ancient civilization? Stonehenge in the uk, which is this iconic, you know? Have\n\nYou been\n\nNo, I haven't. No, you\n\nYou should go. It's\n\nReally special energy\n\nThere, man. Yeah. It's really impressive. And like Constance said, there's a special energy and it's, it's a profoundly moving place. When you visit it, you feel as if you have a connection to something else. It's like going to the pyramids. But they have no idea. They have a rough idea of where the stones might have come from, but they've got no idea how they got there. How they erected them. Yeah.\n\nWho you should go man. Joe Rogan arrested a heath airport. That would be a great fucking story. Boy,\n\nI'm sure they can find some tweets\n\nFor us\n\nBrother. Or just the things that I've said.",
