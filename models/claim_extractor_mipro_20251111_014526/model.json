        "transcript_chunk": "uld listen to stories that they would tell me about like things that they got into and they were getting into things like that. Like on a daily basis. Yeah. There was always shootouts, there was always car wrecks. There was always murders and domestic violence cases. And it's like, man, how many of those guys are just walking around with severe PTSD. Yeah. And no one cares. No one respects it.\n\nNo one's talking about it. No. Like they're just, you know, I, I think that like they don't even acknowledge it themselves. Like I know my dad worked vice in Dallas for his whole career and Woo. And back in the day like, and my and my husband like they just don't, and then they just come home and like, you know, I'd\n\nKill my hearing aids too. Like\n\nHe's like the dog ate, I guarantee you that. He just threw it away.\n\nHe fed it to put peanut butter on that fucking thing.\n\nGood job Reclaimer. We know what you did. Now he put peanut butter on it. That's just wrong. It's just wrong in so many ways.\n\nYeah man. He probably needed peace it and quiet. Yeah.\n\nHe needs mom to hush.\n\nYeah. Everybody shut the fucking world off. Yeah. You know the, one of the greatest pool players, if not the greatest pool player of all time is deaf. There's a guy named Shane Van Boning. Really? And he shuts his hearing aid off when he plays Just\n\nSo it's just silent. Yeah. Just\n\nFuck off world. Wow. And he's just in his like you people could be screaming in the crowd and he doesn't hear shit.\n\nWhat is it about pool? Like what's the, you said you play pool, you like\n\nIt. I've been playing pool for 35 years. Yeah, I've been playing forever.\n\nBut what is it about that particular,\n\nBecause the balls don't give a fuck who you are. They don't care what you think you are, they don't care who you know how much money you have. You know what you've accomplished already. How many shots you've already made. The balls don't care. The pockets are four and a quarter inches wide. And if you don't hit it perfect, it doesn't go in and it requires all of your concentration. And if you really know how to play pool, then you're dealing with like English. So you're dealing with like spin on the cue ball left and right and you're dealing with draw and follow. It's a dance of the mind in these orbs. You're hitting a ball into another ball and trying to get that thing to go straight. And it just requires this complete harmony of hand eye coordination and your spirit. Like you have to like stay calm while you're doing it. That's why\n\nGod, that's a very, that's a very good explanation of that. I'm the worst pool player of all. I mean you would think like playing as many honky tonks as I have played that I could play pool.\n\nMost\n\nPeople, it's so bad.\n\nPeople that think they could play pool can't play pool.\n\nMost people don't.\n\nIt's like, don't know really how to play pool.\n\nLike back in my day it was like just a place to flirt.\n\nYeah. It's that. It's that. The thing about pool is once you get down the road and you start to understand, you get, you really start getting the game and understanding the, and then playing in tournaments and then gambling. Then you're dealing with like real pool players. And these real pool players play pool eight hours a day.\n\nWow.\n\nEvery day you have to because you know how the thing of like being comfortable on stage or being comfortable riding a horse or being comfortable like shooting a bow or, or playing golf. Multiply that times a hundred and you have pool because pool's the only game where you take a stick and you hit a ball into another ball Every other game you hit a ball, you just hit a ball with a stick. But in pool you're hitting a ball into a ball and controlling the movement of both balls. Like the one that's hitting the ball. You're controlling how it spins off to get perfect position on the next shot. And then the other one, you wanna make sure it gets the exact right angle to go into the pocket while you're like calculating all this spin and the geometry of the table and Void collisions. It's maddening.\n\nIt's very like, I just got anxiety. It's maddening. I just got stressed out. It'll\n\nDrive you crazy. It'll, it's a game that will drive you crazy. But when you catch it, there's a thing called being in stroke and and being in dead stroke. It's a rare thing. It happens like, you know, once a month or something like that where you just can't miss where you know where everything is and it's just like calm that comes over like the world dissolves and all you feel is the table and you're completely in sync with the movement of the balls. You know how many revolutions each ball is gonna make. You feel the difference between two extra revolutions, like you know where, how hard to hit it. Exactly. And that's what everybody's chasing. They're chasing this feeling of being in dead\n\nStroke. Why does it happen happen once a month because\n\nIt's so hard to get there. You, you'd probably get, I'd probably get there all the time. If I played like a pro like eight hours a day. You probably get there once a week, but nobody stays there.\n\nBut that's probably the draw that keeps you coming back to it.\n\nYeah. Dudes do drugs just so they can get there. They get hooked on pills they get because they find that like maybe it's amphetamines, maybe it's opiates, whatever it is. Like some guys will do drugs and find that spot and then go back to drugs just to get to that spot.\n\nFrom pool. From\n\nPool. Yeah. Dang. Oh it's a nutty game.\n\nI mean I've never, it's a nutty game ever dug, dug into it like that but\n\nOh, at the highest levels. Guys are gambling from hundreds of thousands of dollars in these fucking weird places in Kentucky and weird pool hall. And they're streaming online on YouTube. They're streaming on different websites. Dang. Oh, it's at the highest level. It is a crazy game. It's a crazy game.\n\nWell I never knew that, but I learned a lot about that\n\nToday. I know a dude who's one of the best in the world and he can't travel because he needs pills. 'cause he so he can't go like overseas. He can't go anywhere. He can't travel without his pills. If he does, he won't play. Right.\n\nReally?\n\nOh, it's nuts. Yeah,\n\nIt's a head game.\n\nOh, what's that? That's it. It's, there's my friend Jeremy Jones, he won the US Open when greatest players of all time. He's like, it is the MO and he plays everything. He played baseball like at a high level. He plays golf plays. He's like, it is the most mental game really. And that's why nobody's good at it. That's why it never gets to a, it never got to a place where it was like really appreciated professionally. Right. Because you have to know how to play it to be, to understand what you're seeing. Yeah. To really see people play well, you have to know what the, what's happening.\n\nI don't, I'd never, I'm not like good at any, I've not played sports, so I'm not good at them.\n\nNo sports\n\nAt all. Well, I didn't really, I mean, I grew up kind of playing softball here and there, or so is golf.\n\nLike the\n\nFirst thing, golf is my first and my mount shooting, which is technically labeled a sport.\n\nThat's a sport for sure.\n\nSo that's like, it's new to me. Like sports are new because I just, I don't know. I started this at 17 and didn't and just was laser focused, like horse with blinders doing country music. And then what\n\nIs it like going from just being a regular high school kid and all of a sudden 17 just being thrust into a spotlight?\n\nWell, I wasn't in the spotlight at first. I was playing shit holes with no lights. But\n\nEven shithole, there's some kind light You're on stage\n\nThe pole light. Yeah. Well, well, I, I don't know. Like, I just, I don't know. I, I feel like that I, I didn't have a choice. It picked me. Like I, it's the only thing I've ever been good at. Everything is hard. It, everything else is hard to me. But like music was the only thing that I was like, I guess that's what I'm supposed to do. 'cause I'm actually good at it. Like, thank god it comes naturally\n\nFollowed it though. So many people have a thing like that and they say, oh, that's just unrealistic. I can't do that.\n\nI didn't have a backup plan that helped. There was that I, I barely graduated high school. I was like, I don't wanna waste my dad's money. That does help Going to college. I was like, I have no backup plan. So like, it really does help. The hunger that it creates is like a fire that you can't explain.\n\nYeah. You know, and it's not good advice. I would never give the advice of don't have a backup plan because some people are not gonna make it. No, you're right. And then they'll blame you. Yeah. You know, you're told me I shouldn't have a backup plan. Yeah. But I really think that for someone who's got some talent and some, a real desire to do that, and, and you can stay the course and you could deal with the hard times. Like you can't have a backup plan. You cannot, because that backup plan will rob your time. Yeah. That's the thing you have to think of. Yeah. It robs your focus. Yeah. It steals from your energy. Yeah. So it'll stop you from reaching your full potential. Fuck your backup plans.\n\nYeah. I mean, it didn't come from me. Yeah.\n\nIt came from me. Fuck your backup plan.\n\nAnd I don't wanna get blamed, but I, I just think that's like, the reason that it happened is a lot of hard work, obviously, and determination, but just nothing else. I have nothing else. Like I was terrible at school, terrible at sports. Had to get tutoring, had to like, stay late for the cheerleading dance. Like everything was just hard for me.\n\nRight. But that's just because you're a great singer. Like that's where your mind works. Like, it's just such a wonderful thing that you found the thing that you're really good at. 'cause some people, some people don't, they just don't know why they, they suck at school. They don't know why they can't pay attention. They don't know why they can't be at work on time. They don't know why. They're like, what's wrong with me? And if maybe that person just found that thing and they're like, oh my God, I'm supposed to be riding horses and shooting balloons. Exactly.\n\nHere I'm, I found me. Yeah. I think it's, I I feel like we're the lucky ones when we get to like, we know like, this is, this is what I'm supposed to do. This is what I'm gonna chase no matter what it costs. And you know, that doesn't, I see so many people that are so immensely talented that just didn't happen for, and Yeah. And you don't, and you don't know why. Like the why you said it, you don't know if it was one little factor of a period in their life or just not seen at the right time or chasing the right thing at the right time. And I don't know, I feel, I feel very thankful for that. But I'm also like trying to learn new things at 40 because I spent my whole adult life doing that. You know what I mean? Yeah. So now I'm like, what can we do next? Let's find another hobby. But that's\n\nA great approach though. Yeah. That's great. I mean, it's recognizing you want to have some more stuff in your life. That's interesting.\n\nI think that does come, I don't know. Does that come with like\n\nWisdom with age,\n\nAge wisdom and, and also feeling accomplished? Yes. I mean, I feel like I set my goals, I hit them. Yeah. You know, and that feels like, oh,\n\nThis episode is brought to you by Goldbelly. This is insane.

There's gotta be a part that, you know, you can relax a little. Like not that you know, you will, you know, when comes to like writing and singing and stuff. Yeah. But at least you don't have to worry. Like, am I gonna make it like, all right. Kind of made it like,\n\nOkay, let have some fun.\n\nYeah. And what's disappointing ma? The whole idea of making it is like your life will be better and you'll have Well your life will be better if you have more fun. Yeah. Like find some stuff you like to do.\n\nExactly. You seem like somebody that chases a lot of new things and conquers them, which I think is really inspiring.\n\nWell, I chase things that can never conquer. That's, that's the key.\n\nWell, that's like that. And no one told me that till I started playing golf and now it's too late.\n\nYeah. Well\n\nYou can't ever win.\n\nFor me, it started with martial arts. You never conquer that. You, there's always gonna be somebody better than you. Especially if you're not a professional,\n\nBut you get really, really good at the things that you're pursuing.\n\nBut it's probably mental.\n\nYou spend time on that illness.\n\nSomething wrong with me. I, I'm for sure if I was born at a different time. I was born in the sixties. They didn't really diagnose kids with a DHD when I was a kid. And\n\nOh, we both have it dope\n\n'em up a hundred percent.\n\nWe a hundred percent have it. A hundred\n\nPercent. I got it. Whatever that fuck it is. It's a superpower. It's a superpower if you use it, right? Yeah,\n\nI think so too.\n\nYeah. Just the idea that you have to medicate a kid 'cause he can't sit in school. Like find out if that kid's good at other stuff. Right. Find out if there's a thing that a hundred percent. Yeah. Okay. Maybe they can't sit there where someone's teaching them math. Maybe they get bored real quick. Maybe they start talking to her friends, whatever it is, they probably have a thing they're really good at. If they could find that thing. I bet they're focused like a motherfucker when they're playing video games. Right? Yeah. So what's that all about? You know, find the thing that that kid can lock into. A\n\nHundred percent agree. Yeah.\n\nThe thing is like, you make people do things that are completely unnatural. You make people sit down when they're six in a chair. Why? Some lady who's making $35,000 a year doesn't like kids is teaching them some shit that she doesn't care about. So there's no energy in the room. Yeah. Everything. And then when they're out in the yard with their friends are having fun and they're laughing and mad, so they're looking around, this is\n\nBullshit.\n\nThis class sucks. And they're talking to each other. And then they get in trouble for talking like, Ugh. Yeah, your child's a problem. Is the child really the problem? Seems like the child has a lot of energy. That's not a problem. Yeah. You just, you're not providing an inspiring environment for a, a growing mind. Just turning you into a, a dull drone. Some worker that just is capable of like shutting themselves off all day and then showing up and then just doing some stuff that they don't wanna do because they were taught how to do it when they were a kid. Like blah.\n\nI feel like there's a lot more opportunities now than there was.",

        "transcript_chunk": "where they had to kill it because it was killing all these cows. And they had stumbled upon this one calve that had gotten right before they got to it. It eviscerated this calve and it, it was still alive and it had eaten some of its organs and they had to kill the calve. And then they're like hunting for this mountain lion and he has a video of him shooting this thing. Dogs chase it up a tree and then he shoots it with a bow and arrow. And then he had it stuffed here and he ate it.\n\nDo you aim, you aim for the heart or the head?\n\nYeah. You aim for the heart and the lungs, whatever is available depending on the position of the mountain lion's arm. Right. Like if the arm is like right here, you wanna, you want to tuck it right behind the shoulder and you're gonna get double lungs. And if the arm is up here, you gonna either get the heart or the lungs depending on where their arm is or whether or not you have a, but that's powerful enough to go through the arm and into the body cavity.\n\nIs there a risk, 'cause maybe this is like an urban myth, but if you hurt, hurt an animal, but you don't kill it, it will come back. Some of them will come back to fuck you up like a kind of revenge movie. No,\n\nJohn Wick of animals.\n\nYeah. I imagine they just run away. They\n\nRun away. Well, it's wild like deer that have survived with an arrow in their body cavity. There was a, a deer skeleton that they found of a deer that they, that someone a hunter killed eventually. And this thing had a arrow that had gone through its body and had turned all into bone. So bone had taken over this arrow and the, the whole ca, there it is. That's what it looked like. Wow.\n\nWow.\n\nIsn't that crazy? Mm. So you could see the broadhead had embedded itself in one of the ribs. And so not only did the deer survive, but its body adapted and grew around the arrow.\n\nWow. Wow. Actually, the reason I said that about the nuts. That is insane about the animal was I know that COVID, particularly crows can remember. They can remember. Oh yeah. And then there's been instances where people have hurt crows and the crows phone away. And then a group of them have attacked the person.\n\nOh yeah. They're really smart. They're, they're super and ravens, I think that are, they're actually different than crows. And they're even smarter than crows. Do you know there's a parrot Who was that parrot? That brave parrot? Yeah. Who told us about that? Who was that the other day? Was that Palmer? Palmer Lucky? I think so. I think\n\nSo. Oh, is that the dude with the helmet? Yes. Holy shit. That helmet, bro.\n\nBro, that helmet's nuts. That helmet's nuts. This guy, that guy was, every now and then I get to sit down with someone and they start talking. I go, whoa, he, this guy's fucking crazy smart. Like weirdly smart. Like, oh, okay, I got it. I got it. Like, tell me what you're doing. And he was telling us about this parrot that actually would speak like a human toddler and new colors, new numbers. Could say things could and would communicate\n\nAfrican gray. Yeah, yeah. Yeah. African grays. They have a, they, they can have the IQ of a 4-year-old child. That\n\nIs nuts. Yeah. When you see this thing talking, you're like, yeah.\n\nAnd their imitation of sounds is like\n\nPerfect. Dead\n\nOn. Yeah. Dead on. Yeah.\n\nBut you have to be around them all the time.\n\nRight, right, right. You\n\nHave a twin that you gotta take with you everywhere you go. Yeah.\n\nReally? Because they just get pulled and fuck, fuck. You can fuck shit up.\n\nAnd then they, they're too smart. They actually start like chopping their own wings off and shit like that. Yeah. They get depressed because they don get stimulation depress, they get depressed. They really need a lot of stimulation. Really? Yeah. They're like humans. I thought about owning app para, but I just traveled too much. Yeah. You\n\nDon't know. You don't want that in your life. That's too much work.\n\nIt's, it's a commitment. Yeah. If\n\nYou leave it alone, it would be sad too. Yeah.\n\nBut that's what I'm saying. Yeah. They\n\nGet mad. I had a buddy of mine who had a parrot and when he would leave it, he would come home and start screaming, where the fuck were you? Like, he wasn't really saying that, but it was like, that was what it was saying. Yeah. It was, was screaming.\n\nWhy get married when you've got that? Right.\n\nYeah. And then he had to, upon coming home, immediately take it out and take it out and like put it on his shoulder. Right. Or put it in his hand. And if you put it down for a second it would start getting pissed off. It's crazy. I'm like, dude, he goes, I know it's a lot. He goes, I didn't think it was gonna be this much. It was like, it was a lot of work. Yeah.\n\nJoe, I'm not, hope I'm not being polite. Have you got any of those cigars where all we smoke? I would love a cigar.\n\nLet's go baby.\n\nIt's a weird thing to ask to be. These are really good. I should have said, if you offer us a cigar, we'll accept one. Come on man.\n\nPlease. Thanks, brother. We have a big ass humid door. There is a, oh, I\n\nDidn't bring my light out\n\nOver there. Some here. Right here.\n\nOh, bonobo chimps are very interesting like that as well.\n\nThey're the weirdest, right? Because they just fuck all the time. This might, might need some juice. Let me give you a little juice.\n\nGo\n\nFor it. They're weird because it's like, okay, so chimps can be either hippies or they can be, you know, like the worst barbarians in human history. Well, it's\n\nLike us.\n\nJust like us. Yeah. That's what's weird. 'cause like, but also the bonobos, like they don't have any, they have one rule. The rule is the mom won't fuck the son. That's it. It's\n\nA good rule. So yeah. It's a good fucking rule man. But they're a\n\nBunch of sister fuckers. They're a bunch of sister fuckers and daughter fuckers. Yeah.\n\nBut they're not motherfuckers. They're\n\nProbably dad fuckers too. They're probably fucking, they're probably doing gay sex too. They, they, they seem wild. They're just having a good time. But\n\nThey, so they're homophobic.\n\nNo, not at all. And they solve all their problems with that. Do\n\nYou need to cut these ones? Yeah. How do\n\nYou It opens like a door.\n\nOh, alright.\n\nRight here. And then you pull those.\n\nBut you know they can learn sign language. Oh yeah.\n\nYou know what's interesting though? They don't ask questions.\n\nSo they're like men. Ah.\n\nBut the parrot did.\n\nThe parrot did. Yeah.\n\nThe parrot asked questions. The parrot had some questions about how things work.\n\nThe African grays are incredibly intelligent. Yeah. Incredibly intelligent.\n\nWell, what I'm interested in is what happens when we can start really decoding dolphin language with ai. Right. And once they really understand what they're saying, then things are gonna get very strange.\n\nLight it. And\n\nYou know, because like, what are they, did they, I mean they're really smart, like silly smart. Like dolphins have enormous frontal lobes.\n\nOh yeah. Man. And communication. They\n\nHave dialects. They have,\n\nThey have dialects. Yeah.\n\nThey sound different. Different\n\nParts of the world. That makes sense. I mean that makes sense. Right? The different, slightly different.\n\nWell, on that note, you think, what about whales? Yeah. Whales brains are literally bigger than us. Yeah. They're, they're enormous. So if we're talking about brain size equals I, which I'm\n\nIt's brain size relative to body master. Yeah.\n\nOh is it? Yeah.\n\nYeah. Because you need a big fucking brain to run a big body. Yeah. Right,\n\nRight. Which is also the argument for why the Neanderthals might have been dumber than us.\n\nWell they were from\n\nWhat we think. They don't know that though. Really? Yeah. They had pretty big brains. What's weird about them is they also had language. Yeah. They had writing and or they had, they definitely had tool making. They had\n\nWriting Don't, I don't think they had\n\nWriting. Writing. No, they didn't have writing. They had language. But they, they did do art. That's what it is. Mm. Wasn't writing necessarily, but they drew stuff and they had a brain that's bigger than ours. But they were also like jacked. They had bigger eyeballs. There was a guy that, this was a, there was a crazy theory that I'm sure is horseshit, but it was cool. Like he made Neanderthals look way different. This guy had a theory like, 'cause we're just, we've never seen a live neanderthal. And he was like, what if we are getting it totally wrong? And what if they were more gorilla looking\n\nThan, but we have the skulls and skeletons down\n\nThere. We have some stuff and they also think they have red hair. This guy was, it's a cracked theory. Right, right. But it was a fun theory. But one of the more fun aspects of this guy's crack theory was that their eyeballs are so much bigger than ours. Their sockets are really big. He's like, what if they have night vision like a deer or like a wolf, you know? Which is totally possible for a primate to have. It's not like, it's not like there's anything about being that kind of a mammal that would exclude you from being able to develop night vision eyesight. Are\n\nThere, are there primates that have that?\n\nI don't\n\nKnow because there's mammals for sure. Yeah.\n\nBut what, yeah, let's ask, let's ask perplexity. Perplexity.\n\nIs\n\nThere any, what is that called? When they have night vision when animals are nocturnal and they could see well at night, you know that thing that like when you're driving and you're see\n\nA fox or something? Yeah,\n\nYeah, yeah. The reflective eyes that they all have. Yeah.\n\nYeah. What is that? I don't, what's\n\nThat called? I dunno. I dunno.\n\nWe should know.\n\nDo you know there's a very interesting theory about ne neanderthals and homo sapiens is there are some people who think that we are one of the few species or one of the only species that has a capacity to deceive Oh and trick. So there was, there's a, there's a theory going around that, that\n\nThe monkeys do that monkeys trick other monkeys into thinking there's an eagle coming. So they steal fruit. Do\n\nThey? Yeah. That's interesting.\n\nThey yell out the sound for eagle and then all the monkeys run away and then they steal the fruit.\n\nOh really? Yeah. Wow.\n\nSo here it is. Monkey primates, the tarsier and the night monkey al monkey are the species with the best vision adapted to night conditions. Right. Okay. So they do. Yeah. See, look at that largest eyes relative to body size of any mammal. So it's something about having a large eye. Because if you, okay. So despite lacking a tape, ofum lucidum, the reflective layer that cause eye shine in many nocturnal animals. Oh, that's what that is. The retina is containing extremely high density of rod photoreceptors, which are highly sensitive to dim light. This allows tarsiers to detect and track prey such as insects in near darkness. And they can see in light as low as 0.001 lux. Similar to moonless nights. Damn. So there's a bunch of different little primates. Oh,\n\nLori's.\n\nBut why, I mean, if you were living in a time, especially if you didn't have fire, if you're living in a time where, you know, there's no roofs, like you're, you're, you're hunting, you're outside at night, you're probably spending as much time as you can hunting. 'cause Neanderthals weren't gatherers, they weren't farmers. So all they did was hunt. Mm. So they probably had some sort of night vision, which would've wild.\n\nYeah. The thing that I find interesting is what is there, I think there's certain, the average person in Europe has around 3% Neanderthal,\n\nDNAD,\n\nNAD three, 3% a if you are African zero. Right. So it's, it's just really interesting. And you see some people, and they're more, they kind of have more than neanderthal kind of appearance too.\n\nYeah, for sure.\n\nAnd then other people. And you go, what, what does that actually give you that 3%? What does it do? Is there any discernible difference whatsoever? Does it make you perhaps more athletic, more re more resilient?\n\nIt's a good question. I mean, I think it would depend. I mean there's also a bunch of other weird strains of human that existed that there, you know, like Dennis Ovs and there's, there's quite a few other ones. Yeah,\n\nYeah.\n\nYeah. You know, who knows what if, I think the Dennis Ovs, I think they definitely got into the gene pool too. I forget who they were saying had a high levels of Dennis Ov DNA, it might have been aboriginal Australians. Hmm. But you know, there's, there was a bunch of different types of human, you know, we just figured out how to be the kiest and the most conniving. And I think probably the most clever,\n\nWell, harra, have you read the Sapiens? His thesis is we, we worked out how to work together beyond the 150 done by number. That was his, his idea is basically we created these shared myths. Religion, money, whatever nation, all of the stuff that we all agree is real that, you know, it feels real. Right. But we, the reason we out-competed other species is that we could cooperate across beyond our immediate tribal group. And that's the reason. That\n\nMakes sense. That makes sense. I mean, there's also, human beings have a very distinct desire to make better things all the time. And if you have that and you're applying that to weapons, you're gonna make the best weapons. Right. You know, I don't know if Neanderthals had that. You know, did they have, I mean, if you're gonna make stuff, right? If you're gonna make tools, you must have some creativity and some desire to innovate. And\n\nCuriosity.\n\nYeah. Curiosity, desire to innovate. 'cause we know that, look, there's certain animals that will use weapons. Right. There's certain, like there's a, a famous photograph of an orangutan that's spearfishing. Have you ever seen that? Yeah. Photo. Mm. But it learned how to do it from people and you know, they'll use rocks to break open crabs and they'll do stuff like that. But they're not fastening an arrowhead No. On a stick or a spear. And they're making it with flint. The inter halls did that. So they got to a level where they're like, okay, this is like craftsmanship. Like this is sophisticated craftsmanship. And it would also probably indicate some sort of a complex language that you could explain where you get the, the gut that you turn into fiber that you use to tie the arrowhead to the stick. Like they were, they were doing, they was doing some high level stuff. Yeah.\n\nFor,\n\nSorry,\n\nGo ahead. For a primate.\n\nYeah. I would imagine also a lot of the innovation comes once you have the greater revolution because there's now surplus food. Yeah. And so you can afford to have a bunch of guys sitting around, not hunting, but like thinking about shit or inventing things or you know, making things in a different way. You know?\n\nDid you see that discovery of a skull that was 500,000 years older than they thought was the origin of human beings? So that it potentially pushes back the original homosapiens to 500,000 years? No.\n\nEarlier.\n\nIs that real? Yeah.\n\nYeah. They think it's, it might push back the date. I mean it's an under debate I'm sure. But I think they might push back the date of the rival of homo sapiens to a million years.\n\nWow.\n\nYeah.\n\nBut it just shows, you know, it's nuts. How,\n\nThis is just nuts.\n\nHow little do we know about ancient civilization? Stonehenge in the uk, which is this iconic, you know? Have\n\nYou been\n\nNo, I haven't. No, you\n\nYou should go. It's\n\nReally special energy\n\nThere, man. Yeah. It's really impressive. And like Constance said, there's a special energy and it's, it's a profoundly moving place. When you visit it, you feel as if you have a connection to something else. It's like going to the pyramids. But they have no idea. They have a rough idea of where the stones might have come from, but they've got no idea how they got there. How they erected them. Yeah.\n\nWho you should go man. Joe Rogan arrested a heath airport. That would be a great fucking story. Boy,\n\nI'm sure they can find some tweets\n\nFor us\n\nBrother. Or just the things that I've said.",

        "transcript_chunk": "eople than cigarettes.\n\nThat funny thing that we have that was fed to us that, you know, cigarettes are this incredible burden on our health healthcare system. In reality, if you look at it, it's a burden. But, you know, there's a lot of people dying of lung cancer who've never had a cigarette. So we haven't really solved that. We don't really know where that's coming from. But in reality, the burden on our healthcare system is obesity and all the problems that come from obesity. That's the biggest. Yeah. We allow food production systems that we know to be extremely unhealthy and very bad. We just allow them to continue on. You know, we've got items of quote unquote food that have been tested and turns out there's no actual food in this. It's just, you know, a manufactured product. I think the, the famous one here was the, the Twine thing. Right? When they actually got around to looking at what was in a twine, they realized that every single part of it was completely unhealthy. Yeah.\n\nIt's just mostly sugar, right? Yeah. Yeah. But Twinkies are delicious and I think you should be able to buy Twinkies, you know what I mean? So I, I'm on both sides of it. I'm a healthy person. I eat 99% of my food is very healthy, but I think you should be able to do whatever the fuck you want. It's just education is the most important thing. And letting people know what they're, and then teaching people some discipline and how to be able to exercise some control over yourself.\n\nSo I was 126 kilos when I finished Nuremberg.\n\nMm.\n\nI'm a hundred 0.9 right now.\n\nThat's amazing. Congratulations. Well,\n\nA lot of that.\n\nYou look great by the way. Thanks. Really do\n\nA lot of that is because you introduced me to your mate Brigham\n\nFrom Waist Towell. Yeah. Yeah.\n\nAnd so I've probably connected with them about five times since that first time we went. And the real benefit that I'm getting that I think, right, because I'm not, not completely over the science, but it seems to be with these injections that I've been getting into my shoulders, into my knees, but also IVs that it's calmed down my body's inflammation. You know, I think we talked before about just how many old injuries I carry, you know, and how like the injuries in my shoulders have a deeply arthritic, but we can now see in an ultrasound over time how, what was messy a year ago and like big thick bands of of arthritis now it's just lessened. You know, probably by about 70% on one area of my right shoulder, probably about 90%. So my range of motion, if we'd done this last year, would've been about there. Right. But now is fucking rock and roll something, you\n\nKnow what I mean? Isn't that great? It's all\n\nGoing good, you know? I know. It's amazing. And like, just feeling like the musculature starting to build and everything. I'm taking it really slowly. And that was one of the things I was worried about with Highlander because jumping into that role with the shooting date coming, it was like, man, I've gotta do, I've gotta do three workouts a day. I gotta, you know, and that for me is a bad recipe because yeah, I can, I can do that for X amount of time, but once I stop, I'm gonna stop completely. You know? And what I want to do is I wanna make all these changes and make it a long-term situation. So I think the Waste two world was a great call for me because it's calmed down a bunch of stuff. It's taken a bunch of pain away, you know, so I can go and work out and not have to suffer for two or three hours afterwards. Yeah. You know, you know, I'm still picking up injuries 'cause I've gotta face the fact I'm 61. Yeah. You know, like the other day I'm doing my cat guitar dinosaur trying to get this fricking move going on. A fricking tore the tendon here on the ulnar. Ugh. So that's gonna be bad for sword fighting, but I'm trying to fix that without having to have a, a surgical,\n\nHow bad is it torn?\n\nIt's only a little bit really, you know. Okay.\n\nYou just gotta make sure you don't overuse it while it's healing. Can you brace it? Well\n\nThe, the, the problem I've got is I've got X amount of time to claim the skill and either way, right. If I do the rehab exercises without doing surgery, if it fails, I'm now falling right on production and you know, of re torn or something. Right.\n\nBut I can help you with that. Just do this skill slowly.\n\nYeah.\n\nHere's the thing about skills. Skills that you learn slowly. You can translate into high speed quickly. Yeah. Because you develop a neural pathway. So instead of using an actual sword, use a foam sword use like one of those little fucking noodle things that people put in the pool. Use that. So you're just, just develop them. When I was teaching martial arts, one of the things that I always tell people is don't try to do it quickly when I show you something, I want you to do it slowly.\n\nThat's exactly what I did. Yeah. I'm in a car park and we were talking about the speed of something and I went, oh yeah, so you get sh and I went, oh fuck.\n\nAnd I\n\nKnew I to, but I just put my sword away and I kept the conversation going. Didn't mention it, but I got home and I was like, oh fuck.\n\nOh, you rushed, you didn't warm up. Yeah.\n\nWell the thing is we were warm, but it was a thing that I just, just in that split second, I thought, I wonder what it's like to go full speed. Oh. And I did it and I, and I just like, no way too early. But you're absolutely right. Pace is deceptive. Yeah. If you learn something, I mean, you know, that's like that old fashioned sort of stuff with with with the karate I first did when I was a kid, you know, they aim for you to do 10,000 of something before you have to use it in an actual competitive fight. You know?\n\nYeah. People who train people with guns have a saying, slow is smooth, smooth is fast.\n\nRight? Yeah.\n\nYeah. Absolutely. You want herky jerky movements and with martial arts and specifically sword fighting, it's, there's very specific movements that you're learning. And if you learn those movements slow as you speed up, you'll be going along the right pathway. And when I would teach people kicks in particular because it's a weird thing to learn how to kick something. Like you've gotta do it slowly. 'cause if you try to muscle it, you're gonna develop a bad habit that's gonna keep you from achieving full power because you want a proper technique. Yeah. And\n\nYou have to process where your balance is. Yeah. You know, what you, how you're pushing your force, but how you retain Yeah. You know, the ability to reset. Yeah.\n\nYeah. Juujitsu as well. People that learn by drilling, they get way better, way quicker by doing it flowing and doing it more easy and play like the Gracie's always say keep it playful. Yeah.\n\nLike that's, well see the thing is I know all this stuff, but I was in such a point of weariness that I was just trying to please people. Right. Oh. And so I muck myself up and you know, but I've got a bit of time now for it to heal and for me to start and actually do like, I like to do, you know,\n\nHave you visited Brigham while you're here?\n\nYeah. Yeah. I saw him missed that. Okay, great. Yeah, he's looking great.\n\nYeah, he looks great, right? Yeah. He is looking good.\n\nHe'll look you up the new, the new place. And now here's the thing. We talk about this and your listeners would probably, you know, it's expensive. No two ways about it. So it's possibly not at everybody's grasp what the sort of things that I'm doing. But I think, I'm not sure if this is absolutely right, but I think, you know, one of his sort of fervent ambitions Brigham, is to make it more available. Yes. You know, because this should be, this is cutting edge medicine. Yes. You know, if we can sort of write things in our bodies with an injection as opposed to an operation, you know, the problem I had in my left shoulder, I go and see my shoulder surgeon who fixed it while I was doing Cinderella, man. And so I did two operations with this guy, one in 2001 and the second one in 2004. But it's always had a sort of problem. And, and he did say at the time, after the second operation, that he had to cut a few corners and it would probably cause me problems later on in life. So I probably went to see him about five or six years ago and he said, okay, so you are, this shoulder is at a point of arthritis. Now what we have to do is we have to cut through the muscle bar, we have to pop out the humeral head of your arm bone. We have to shave off the top of the humal head and then we have to put a carbon fiber cap and then we have to put it back in. So everything back up, you've got about 12 months of rehab. Right. Just sounds wrong. You know, it just sounds wrong. It's like, you know, so this process that I've been going through with Brigham, basically having the effect of layering so I can now see that if the arthritis was that deep, it's now this deep, you know, it's still there. I haven't solved it yet, but I'm giving my body what it needs to make it better.\n\nAlso, there's new breakthroughs almost every week, right. And these new breakthroughs, they're, they're able to achieve the, the, they're, they're growing actual cartilage on people that were bone on bone. Right? So they're, they're developing new methods to regenerate tissue. That's the cushioning in between your, your knees and your elbows and all these things that were, and shoulders that we're requiring people to get those horrific things. Putting an artificial joint in place. 'cause everything is so arthritic.\n\nThat's one of the things that does trouble me greatly in for this country health medical systems to benefit everybody. Something has perverted here where, you know, the drug that I might need that I can buy for $50 for a month supply in Australia is two and a half thousand dollars for a month here. Yeah. Come on man. I know what's going on. It's crazy. You know, and where's, see you've got all these elected representatives here and this country's got, you know, a lot, you know, that's what you should be working on man. You know? Yeah.\n\nBut they can't\n\nBecause everybody's got their, their hands\n\n500 back. Everybodys their hands tied. Yeah. They're all got their, including the media. That's the crazy things. The amount of money they spend on advertising for the media that really just serves the purpose of now the media can't criticize the pharmaceutical drug companies. Right.\n\nWild. Yeah. Wild. It's interesting. It's because, you know, I get back here as you know, you know, my girlfriend's from New Orleans and you know, we're sitting and watching TV here and she's now seeing America from the outside. 'cause she spends most of the time traveling with me. And we don't spend that much time in, within America. You know, we live in Australia, but we've been, I've been working mainly in, in, in Europe the last few years. So she's now coming back to her country, but she's got fresh eyes and she's sitting there the other night she was watching something. She came out, she said, I've just watched like 12 ads for drugs. Right. Just one after the other, after the other, after the other. You know what, what's this tiny little problem that you might have? Or you know, if I can say it in a certain way to make you think that you've got it, bang, I got a drug for it. Bang, bang. You know? And yeah. I mean 600,000 plus people in this country in the next 12 months will go bankrupt because of their medical bills. You know how many people will go bankrupt in Australia because of their medical bills in the next 12 months?\n\nZero. Zero.\n\nYeah.\n\nYeah. It's one of the biggest problems we have. You know, and the idea that you would let that happen and not do anything about it because you're bought and paid for by these enormous companies is kind of insane. Yeah. It's insane. And they're trying, they're trying to do something about that, you know, and RFK junior's fighting an uphill battle trying to do something about that. But it's a captured industry.\n\nYeah. Yeah.\n\nAnd you know,\n\nThe\n\nFact socialized medicine, fact,\n\nProbably the fact the largest western economy is punishing its citizens in that way. Yeah. Just beggars belief. That's crazy that healthcare isn't such a principle thing. 'cause if, if, if we're not looking after ourselves and aiming for the longest life, what's the point of the human existence kind of thing. You know what I mean? So that should be a principle. Everybody's health should be a principle focus of our elected representative. Well\n\nSaid. Russell Crowe, you're the fucking man.

        "transcript_chunk": "paralysis tick. And they realized, she realized that between her and this other girl that looks after the, the puppy and we're not there, they'd got their dates mixed up. And so it wasn't actually covered for flea and tick, you know, stuff in its bloodstream. Mm. So very dangerous. So they had to shave the dog completely and everything. And they, they pulled off another couple of ticks, but there was only just the one paralysis tick. So it's okay. But if you leave that, and if you don't deal with it, the dog's gonna be dead in a minute.\n\nParalysis\n\nTick. Yeah. Yeah. It gets into their, into their body. And, and it is, it, it affects them the way the name says on the box, the\n\nParalysis. There's one that's going on in America now called, called the Well, what it, what it gives you. It's, it's a lone star tick is what what gives you this bite. And this produces something called Alpha Gal. And it makes you allergic to red meat. What? Yeah. It's my friend, my good friend Evan Fer. Got it. And he, he was allergic to red meat for a good solid year. And then eventually it went away. And then it came back again Recently. It's, it's a huge pain in the ass. So\n\nWe, we have ticks in Australia, but we've never had to deal with Lyme disease like you have here. Mm. But in the last, you know, four or five decades, people started raising deer in Australia for, for meat and what have you. And a few of them get away. You know, there's, there's no deer farms around where I am, which is north of Sydney by 600 Ks. But recently a couple of the guys that worked for me on the farm said they've seen deer going through the bush at the back of my block. You know, so that means that there's some just animals that have escaped, and they're most likely to have been in the southern highlands, which is south of Sydney. And somehow they've got themselves all the way up to where, where I am. How\n\nMany miles is that? Or kilometers?\n\nWell, we're probably talking about 700 something kilometers.\n\nThey just wandered. Yeah.\n\nWow. And, and didn't get run over or didn't get, you know, that's crazy.\n\nThat's\n\nAbsolutely.\n\nAnd they're probably bringing ticks,\n\nProbably and the wrong tics.\n\nYeah. In America, they have a problem with That too. Deer farms and this disease called chronic wasting disease, and it's spread throughout, large swaths of America have a giant issue with this, where deer herds get infected. My friend Doug Duran, he has a, a farm out in Wisconsin and they, they've had a significant problem with it to the point where they've started issuing more tags and thinning the herd. They're trying to kill more deer to try to lessen this spread of this stuff. Right. 'cause chronic wasting disease, it get, it's a PreOn disease, so it's like, it, it gets on plants. It has, it stays on them for a long time. So, and they start drooling when they have it. And in that drool is more chronic wasting disease. Right. So another deal will come along and graze on the ground where they drool, then they get it. Horrible, horrible disease. And a lot of it emanated from these deer farms\n\nWhen I first bought the farm, which was a hundred acres to start with, but it's now like 1700 and it's attached to a state forest as well. So I can get up behind my place and go for days. Oh wow. Which is just sort of like, you know, which is cool, but back in the day, we used to have platypus in the creeks. We had wombats, and now I see more foxes down. I see native animals, or I see an equivalent amount of foxes as I see wallabies\n\nAre foxes invasive. Yeah. Yeah. Okay.\n\nThere you go. And they're absolute, you know? Yeah. Because they eat anything and everything. Yeah. I used to have a big family of what we call bush turkeys living behind the house, and they're still there, but they used to just proudly walk around, you know? And, and it was fun. You'd going through the bush and then suddenly there's a road full of bush turkeys. It's great, you know, but now the population is right down and they're totally ninja now. You know, you don't see them very often when you do, they're like very suspicious. They checking you out, you know, he's just being\n\nHunted 24 7.\n\nIt's foxes, man.\n\nYeah. You also have a, a large feral cat problem,\n\nRight? Gigantic. Yeah, gigantic. The one and only cat that I let my mother have at the farm. This is way back man. I was training for Cinderella, man. And, you know, they sent me this group of boxes, Olympic guys and stuff like that. And every single one of 'em can smash the piss outta me in the ring. So I've gotta smash the piss outta 'em in other areas. So I train them until they drop, you know, getting them on bicycles and taking them to the bush, you know, and things like that. Just to sort of like, keep the balance, you know? Right. And this one particular day, and I had it in my mind that I was just gonna absolutely smash them. I was gonna get into this situation 'cause it's one road, you know? And I was just gonna get so far in front of them, psychologically damage them, you know what I mean?\n\nSo, and I, I just devious, yeah. Just\n\nHad a conversation with my mom and she was like, oh darling, you know, I, you know, I'd really love to have a cat. And I'm like, mom, we lived in this privileged situation. We've got sulfur, crested, cockatoos roses, king parrots, all these beautiful birds. And the worst thing that we could do for them is put a cat into that. So you can't have a cat. You know, I'm riding through the bush, 25, 30 Ks in at this point, right. I'm getting to the top of this hill. I'm looking down, I'm seeing these boys struggling quite some distance, probably about a kilometer and a half away from me, you know? And I'm going, good, I'll just have a little rest here. And I just hear this little noise and I'm like, what the hell is that? So I just take three or four steps off the road. You know, probably about seven or eight minutes ago, I was coming around this corner and a car was there on the road, which is kind of unusual for the state forest in that particular area. Right? So I take these three or four steps in and there's a little kitten sitting in the bush, like, what the hell? So I pick it up, it's warm, you know, I can't leave it here. So I, I put it in my backpack, right? And I complete the ride. I get to the top of this hill where this t trig station is, and everybody's standing around and I go, oh, I found a cat. You know? So I bring it out, everyone's, all these big boxes go, ooh, you know, cute little kitten. So I took it home to my mom. I said, okay, here's your cat. You know, and the way that I reasoned it is like, this is me saying to my mother, you cannot have something that will make you happy. And then the universe goes, listen to your mother. So, you know, that cat hated human beings for the rest of its life, you know? Wow. The only person it got on with was my mum. And we used to have like four bells around his neck. So to give the birds enough warning so it didn't cause too much damage. So\n\nWas a feral cat then,\n\nI think? Or was\n\nIt tossed outta that car?\n\nI think so, yeah.\n\nOh, it\n\nWas too clean and too warm for it to have been living. But that's what people do. That's, they have a problem. They have a cat that has a litter. They dunno how to solve it. Pet stores don't want it. Their friends don't want it. So they come up with the concept of just chucking them into the bush.\n\nWell, didn't it start out what they brought, they introduce cats to try to eliminate some other animal.\n\nWe have such a history of stupidity in that regard. Have you heard of the cane tote?\n\nYes. Yes.\n\nIt's just so fantastic. Right? Yeah. So, you know, they're growing sugar cane in Queensland and there's a particular flying creature that they want to control. So they start looking around. We always blame the British for this. 'cause it's usually, it's usually a naturalist, a British naturalist or scientist that comes up with the concept. And so they, they look through all the ahs, can't remember where they found it from, but they, they found this toad who seemed to have this appetite for this particular insect. And they would feed it, it ate at them. Great. So we'll introduce the cane toad to get amongst the sugar cane and lessen that creature. When they were checking if the cane toad would eat the creature, they were feeding it dead once. Right? It's a flying creature. Toad doesn't have a tongue like a frog. Can't catch this thing if it's flying. Oh. So, my God, it was of no use at all. Oh my God. In trying to lessen that com population. However, it became like a dominant species. And it was in Queensland, but now it's starting to come in New South Wales. So they're basically marching south. And it's a problem, man. It's, it's like a serious problem. They secrete poison. So if a dog gets interested and the toe gets afraid, the dog can sort of like sniff or lick its head, then get poisoned and that's the end of your dog, you know? But there was a period of time there where there's actually a documentary from the nineties called Cane Toads. And it sort of just points out how crazy people were getting with it. You know, people in a small country towns walking from their house to the pub, taking a cricket bat and just smacking the cane toes off the road as they went. You know, it's like all these people becoming like, you know, crazed with the idea of, of getting rid of the cane toe population. But it, it hasn't affected them. They just keep growing. How much\n\nIs the population now? How big is it?\n\nSo big? And these things, Jamie, can you do me a favor? Look up the weight of the largest cane toad that they found. Because it's, it's always a surprise. I mean, these things grow and if they're in the right environment and things that they can eat and feed on, they just get bigger and bigger. That's not the biggest. Look at this thing. Look at this thing, mate.\n\nWhoa. That's like an English bulldog.\n\nHowdy duty. It's bigger than my dog.\n\nOh my god. Bigger than one. My dogs look at his head. What is the weight on that fucker? What does it\n\nSay?\n\nThat's crazy.\n\nYep.\n\nI gotta find another one to add. Fuck me. Hold on.\n\nI gotta weight there.\n\nIt say how big\n\nThat was a record. Of course.\n\nIt's Oh, fat. That fucker is 2.7\n\nGrams. 5.8 pounds. Wow. That looks bigger than 5.8 pounds.\n\nIt does. But it might be a perspective thing either way. I said that\n\nWas the current one.\n\nOh. Show the video. Scroll up so you can see that video. Or make it larger, like when she's holding it. Yeah. It looks like about five pounds. Boy. Have you ever seen when they, there's a lot of horrible videos online where they take toads and they put 'em in a box with mice. You ever see what toads do to mice? No. You would never think that toads are ferocious. Right. You know, you'd never think that toads are basically monsters. These just giant mouth monsters that swallow mice's hole. But they do. They're super aggressive. It's crazy to watch. Jamie. I know you're gonna get one. I just had to\n\nMake sure it was worth pulling\n\nUp. Is this a good one? Yeah, but there's, there's ones where there's a bunch of 'em in boxes. See, this one is kind of weird because he's not freaking out yet.\n\nHe's being sneaky. Oh, what's that? Look at\n\nThat head. See him get excited. Look at his head. I mean, if that thing was giant, like that was a hippopotamus shaped chasing after you. Ah, look how quick that is. How did, how did he get it?\n\nHe must be closer than it\n\nLooks like. He just swallowed 'em whole. Yeah. Oh, watch how quick he does it. Yeah. This\n\nBit here. Oh, it's just one step forward and bang. Yeah,\n\nJust snap. Yeah. Go see if he could find one of them video. Oh, he just inhales them. Like, he literally inhaled him. He's got a little bit of a tongue. Oh, he, he grabbed him with the tongue first. Right? He yanked him in. Oh God. See if you can find those videos where there's a ton of them in a box.\n\nWe're getting two live feedings of the mice like this.\n\nEither way,\n\nThat's a giant bullfrog. It's not a cane to slightly different\n\nGiant African bullfrog either way. Point is they eat mice, they eat 'em whole. Right? And, and how many of 'em are now in Australia? How many million? Oh, here we go. This guy's just gonna go ham. It starts. Oh, he's gonna eat all of them. Look how gross those things are. They look so dumb. Just so mindless and, and gross.\n\nNo, I don't think he's gonna get all of 'em. Video's not long enough.\n\nHe hasn't gotten any of them. I can, what's going on here\n\nPast it,\n\nJust gathering them in a corner. Ugh.\n\nIt's, it's a creepy animal. So and so look, what are the numbers? Like, put that into perplexity\n\nCane toads.\n\nYeah. How many cane toads? Ask our sponsor, how many cane toads are in Australia? And what was the initial deposit? Like? How many They drop off that I had it,\n\nIt was only a couple hundred. And then they bred like 60,000 in 1937. And the answer for now is estimated at 200 million.\n\nMan. And that little flyer that eats the sugar cane, it's still there. Oh\n\nMy god. 200 million. Yeah.\n\nBut see, look, if you see where those that see that cluster of light blue balls, right? They basically in there, in the middle of that, that cluster is where they dropped them to start with. And look at how they've,\n\nWell they're gonna make their way across the whole\n\nCountry. Oh, there you go. 40, 49. So the white one is actually where they put them to start.\n\nWow.\n\nAnd everything else is migration.\n\nAnd by 2000, look how far they've gone. Mm. Wow. What's the plan to get rid of those things?\n\nI'm not sure that they have a cohesive plan. There's no\n\nPlan. Well, that's the problem. If they have a plan, they're gonna bring in some lizard or something. Yeah. In\n\nFrogs that's gonna end up gonna end up, you know, doing something else. Yeah. It's gonna\n\nKill everything\n\nElse. Every single time they've done that. You know, like in New Zealand for example, they introduced the goss bush as a way to have hedging instead of fences. But New Zealand's got a way higher rainfall and sunshine hours than England where it came from. So now it's just everywhere, you know. So beautiful arable farmlands just taken over by Gores. And when it grows in Australia, in New Zealand, it grows thicker and more prickly and much harder to, to deal with. We have the same thing in Australia with plants like Lantana just everywhere, all through the bush, you know, in my lifetime. So in 96 I used to be able to walk through certain areas of my property, just under tall trees with, you know, subtropical ferns and vines on the ground. Now there's many areas of my property that are just impossible. You cannot get through it anymore. 'cause it's choked out with introduced weeds.\n\nWhat is that crazy plant down south that we talked about Once that is overrun some of these forests, it's pretty beautiful, but it's also very creepy to see what it's done. Just like taken over all the trees, all the trees, all the, anything on the ground just covered wisteria. It, it's called kudzu. Kudzu. Yeah.\n\nI'll show you. I'll make sure this is the right stuff. That's\n\nWhat you're talking about? Yeah. That's it. Look at that. Right?\n\nIsn't\n\nThat nuts? Yeah.\n\nLike\n\nThat image is creepy. I mean, that's like a steaming\n\nAt the back of my place, man. I used to have that waterfalls and creeks.\n\nLook at that. It's taking over that whole building. That's crazy. Everything. Yeah. Just where'd they come from?\n\nSee, that's in Fiji.\n\nYeah, it's in the United States though. So what was it, how was it brought in?\n\nChina, Korea, Japan.\n\nOh, did people bring it in on purpose? That's\n\nWhere it's, that's where it's originated from.\n\nSorry. Right. History of us introduction introduced from Japan in 1876. Yeah. New Orleans Exposition. Oh, that's where I heard there's a lot of it. Vine was widely marketed in the southeast as an ornamental plant, and then it just took\n\nOver California.\n\nWow. It's, it's funny when people try to do that.",

      "instructions": "You are an expert claim extraction system analyzing podcast transcript text. Your task is to identify and extract factual, verifiable claims while filtering out opinions, speculation, and conversational filler.\n\n**ANALYSIS PROCESS:**\n1. Read through the transcript chunk carefully, identifying distinct factual assertions made by speakers\n2. Distinguish between verifiable facts and subjective opinions/commentary/personal experiences\n3. For each potential claim, ensure it meets ALL criteria below\n4. Reformulate claims to be self-contained, declarative statements ready for fact-checking\n\n**CLAIM CRITERIA - Each claim must be:**\n- **Factual**: A statement that can be independently verified as true or false (not opinions, beliefs, speculation, or personal feelings)\n- **Self-contained**: Include full context with proper nouns; replace ALL pronouns with specific referents (names, titles, entities)\n- **Specific**: Include relevant details like names, numbers, dates, locations, measurements when mentioned\n- **Concise**: 5-40 words maximum\n- **Declarative**: Reformulated as a clear, complete statement (not a question, conditional, or hypothetical)\n- **Attributed when necessary**: If someone claims something controversial or unverified, attribute it to them (e.g., \"X said that Y\")\n\n**WHAT TO EXTRACT:**\n- Historical facts and events with specific details\n- Scientific/medical claims and findings\n- Statistics, measurements, and quantifiable data\n- Biographical information about named individuals\n- Named entities and their verifiable attributes\n- Specific actions taken by identified individuals/organizations\n- Verifiable relationships between named entities\n- Claims about products, places, or phenomena that can be fact-checked\n\n**WHAT TO EXCLUDE:**\n- Opinions, beliefs, and subjective assessments (\"I think\", \"I feel\", \"seems like\")\n- Hypothetical scenarios (\"what if\", \"could be\", \"might have\")\n- Questions and uncertainties\n- Conversational acknowledgments (\"yeah\", \"right\", \"I see\", \"mm-hmm\")\n- Vague statements without specific referents or context\n- Personal anecdotes without verifiable factual content\n- Future predictions or speculation about what will happen\n- Advice or recommendations\n- Emotional reactions or subjective experiences\n- Meta-commentary about the conversation itself\n\n**OUTPUT FORMAT REQUIREMENT:**\nReturn claims as a valid JSON array using ONLY double quotes.\nFormat: [\"claim one\", \"claim two\", \"claim three\"]\n- Use double quotes (\") only - never use single quotes (')\n- Ensure proper JSON escaping for quotes within claims (use \\\")\n- Each claim should be a complete, standalone sentence with subject and predicate\n- Return empty array [] if no verifiable claims exist in the transcript\n\n**QUALITY CHECKS BEFORE EXTRACTING:**\n- Can this claim be fact-checked against external, authoritative sources?\n- Does it contain all necessary context to understand what is being claimed without reading the transcript?\n- Is every pronoun (he, she, it, they, this, that) replaced with its specific referent?\n- Is it free from opinion markers and subjective language?\n- Would a fact-checker know exactly what to verify?\n\n**EXAMPLES:**\n\nExample 1:\nTranscript: \"Trump said he would build a wall on the southern border. The wall would be 30 feet tall and Mexico would pay for it, he claimed.\"\nCORRECT: [\"Donald Trump said he would build a wall on the southern border\", \"Donald Trump claimed the wall would be 30 feet tall\", \"Donald Trump claimed Mexico would pay for the border wall\"]\nWRONG: [\"The speaker discusses Trump's border wall plans\", \"He mentions a 30-foot wall\", \"There will be a border wall\"]\n\nExample 2:\nTranscript: \"Bitcoin reached $69,000 in November 2021. That was crazy! I think it'll go higher next year.\"\nCORRECT: [\"Bitcoin reached $69,000 in November 2021\"]\nWRONG: [\"The speaker discusses Bitcoin prices\", \"Bitcoin will go higher next year\", \"The price was crazy\", \"The speaker thinks Bitcoin reached a high price\"]\n\nExample 3:\nTranscript: \"Yeah, you know, I really love that movie. The effects were amazing.\"\nCORRECT: [] (no verifiable factual claims - only opinions)\nWRONG: [\"The speaker loves the movie\", \"The effects were amazing\"]\n\nExample 4:\nTranscript: \"Shane Van Boning is probably the greatest pool player ever. He's deaf and turns off his hearing aid when he plays.\"\nCORRECT: [\"Shane Van Boning is deaf\", \"Shane Van Boning turns off his hearing aid when he plays pool\"]\nWRONG: [\"Shane Van Boning is the greatest pool player\", \"The speaker talks about a pool player\"]",
