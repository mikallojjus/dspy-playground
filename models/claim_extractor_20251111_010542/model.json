Just beggars belief. That's crazy that healthcare isn't such a principle thing.

And so it wasn't actually covered for flea and tick, you know, stuff in its bloodstream. Mm. So very dangerous. So they had to shave the dog completely and everything. And they, they pulled off another couple of ticks, but there was only just the one paralysis tick. So it's okay. But if you leave that, and if you don't deal with it, the dog's gonna be dead in a minute.\n\nParalysis\n\nTick. Yeah. Yeah. It gets into their, into their body. And, and it is, it, it affects them the way the name says on the box, the\n\nParalysis. There's one that's going on in America now called, called the Well, what it, what it gives you. It's, it's a lone star tick is what what gives you this bite. And this produces something called Alpha Gal. And it makes you allergic to red meat. What? Yeah. It's my friend, my good friend Evan Fer. Got it. And he, he was allergic to red meat for a good solid year. And then eventually it went away. And then it came back again Recently. It's, it's a huge pain in the ass. So\n\nWe, we have ticks in Australia, but we've never had to deal with Lyme disease like you have here. Mm. But in the last, you know, four or five decades, people started raising deer in Australia for, for meat and what have you. And a few of them get away. You know, there's, there's no deer farms around where I am, which is north of Sydney by 600 Ks. But recently a couple of the guys that worked for me on the farm said they've seen deer going through the bush at the back of my block. You know, so that means that there's some just animals that have escaped, and they're most likely to have been in the southern highlands, which is south of Sydney. And somehow they've got themselves all the way up to where, where I am. How\n\nMany miles is that? Or kilometers?\n\nWell, we're probably talking about 700 something kilometers.\n\nThey just wandered. Yeah.\n\nWow. And, and didn't get run over or didn't get, you know, that's crazy.\n\nThat's\n\nAbsolutely.\n\nAnd they're probably bringing ticks,\n\nProbably and the wrong tics.\n\nYeah. In America, they have a problem with That too. Deer farms and this disease called chronic wasting disease, and it's spread throughout, large swaths of America have a giant issue with this, where deer herds get infected. My friend Doug Duran, he has a, a farm out in Wisconsin and they, they've had a significant problem with it to the point where they've started issuing more tags and thinning the herd. They're trying to kill more deer to try to lessen this spread of this stuff. Right. 'cause chronic wasting disease, it get, it's a PreOn disease, so it's like, it, it gets on plants. It has, it stays on them for a long time. So, and they start drooling when they have it. And in that drool is more chronic wasting disease. Right. So another deal will come along and graze on the ground where they drool, then they get it. Horrible, horrible disease. And a lot of it emanated from these deer farms\n\nWhen I first bought the farm, which was a hundred acres to start with, but it's now like 1700 and it's attached to a state forest as well. So I can get up behind my place and go for days. Oh wow. Which is just sort of like, you know, which is cool, but back in the day, we used to have platypus in the creeks. We had wombats, and now I see more foxes down. I see native animals, or I see an equivalent amount of foxes as I see wallabies\n\nAre foxes invasive. Yeah. Yeah. Okay.\n\nThere you go. And they're absolute, you know? Yeah. Because they eat anything and everything. Yeah. I used to have a big family of what we call bush turkeys living behind the house, and they're still there, but they used to just proudly walk around, you know? And, and it was fun. You'd going through the bush and then suddenly there's a road full of bush turkeys. It's great, you know, but now the population is right down and they're totally ninja now. You know, you don't see them very often when you do, they're like very suspicious. They checking you out, you know, he's just being\n\nHunted 24 7.\n\nIt's foxes, man.\n\nYeah. You also have a, a large feral cat problem,\n\nRight? Gigantic. Yeah, gigantic. The one and only cat that I let my mother have at the farm. This is way back man. I was training for Cinderella, man. And, you know, they sent me this group of boxes, Olympic guys and stuff like that. And every single one of 'em can smash the piss outta me in the ring. So I've gotta smash the piss outta 'em in other areas. So I train them until they drop, you know, getting them on bicycles and taking them to the bush, you know, and things like that. Just to sort of like, keep the balance, you know? Right. And this one particular day, and I had it in my mind that I was just gonna absolutely smash them. I was gonna get into this situation 'cause it's one road, you know? And I was just gonna get so far in front of them, psychologically damage them, you know what I mean?\n\nSo, and I, I just devious, yeah. Just\n\nHad a conversation with my mom and she was like, oh darling, you know, I, you know, I'd really love to have a cat. And I'm like, mom, we lived in this privileged situation. We've got sulfur, crested, cockatoos roses, king parrots, all these beautiful birds. And the worst thing that we could do for them is put a cat into that. So you can't have a cat. You know, I'm riding through the bush, 25, 30 Ks in at this point, right. I'm getting to the top of this hill. I'm looking down, I'm seeing these boys struggling quite some distance, probably about a kilometer and a half away from me, you know? And I'm going, good, I'll just have a little rest here. And I just hear this little noise and I'm like, what the hell is that? So I just take three or four steps off the road. You know, probably about seven or eight minutes ago, I was coming around this corner and a car was there on the road, which is kind of unusual for the state forest in that particular area. Right? So I take these three or four steps in and there's a little kitten sitting in the bush, like, what the hell? So I pick it up, it's warm, you know, I can't leave it here. So I, I put it in my backpack, right? And I complete the ride. I get to the top of this hill where this t trig station is, and everybody's standing around and I go, oh, I found a cat. You know? So I bring it out, everyone's, all these big boxes go, ooh, you know, cute little kitten. So I took it home to my mom. I said, okay, here's your cat. You know, and the way that I reasoned it is like, this is me saying to my mother, you cannot have something that will make you happy. And then the universe goes, listen to your mother. So, you know, that cat hated human beings for the rest of its life, you know? Wow. The only person it got on with was my mum. And we used to have like four bells around his neck. So to give the birds enough warning so it didn't cause too much damage. So\n\nWas a feral cat then,\n\nI think? Or was\n\nIt tossed outta that car?\n\nI think so, yeah.\n\nOh, it\n\nWas too clean and too warm for it to have been living. But that's what people do. That's, they have a problem. They have a cat that has a litter. They dunno how to solve it. Pet stores don't want it. Their friends don't want it. So they come up with the concept of just chucking them into the bush.\n\nWell, didn't it start out what they brought, they introduce cats to try to eliminate some other animal.\n\nWe have such a history of stupidity in that regard. Have you heard of the cane tote?\n\nYes. Yes.\n\nIt's just so fantastic. Right? Yeah. So, you know, they're growing sugar cane in Queensland and there's a particular flying creature that they want to control. So they start looking around. We always blame the British for this. 'cause it's usually, it's usually a naturalist, a British naturalist or scientist that comes up with the concept. And so they, they look through all the ahs, can't remember where they found it from, but they, they found this toad who seemed to have this appetite for this particular insect. And they would feed it, it ate at them. Great. So we'll introduce the cane toad to get amongst the sugar cane and lessen that creature. When they were checking if the cane toad would eat the creature, they were feeding it dead once. Right? It's a flying creature. Toad doesn't have a tongue like a frog. Can't catch this thing if it's flying. Oh. So, my God, it was of no use at all. Oh my God. In trying to lessen that com population. However, it became like a dominant species. And it was in Queensland, but now it's starting to come in New South Wales. So they're basically marching south. And it's a problem, man. It's, it's like a serious problem. They secrete poison. So if a dog gets interested and the toe gets afraid, the dog can sort of like sniff or lick its head, then get poisoned and that's the end of your dog, you know? But there was a period of time there where there's actually a documentary from the nineties called Cane Toads. And it sort of just points out how crazy people were getting with it. You know, people in a small country towns walking from their house to the pub, taking a cricket bat and just smacking the cane toes off the road as they went. You know, it's like all these people becoming like, you know, crazed with the idea of, of getting rid of the cane toe population. But it, it hasn't affected them. They just keep growing. How much\n\nIs the population now? How big is it?\n\nSo big? And these things, Jamie, can you do me a favor? Look up the weight of the largest cane toad that they found. Because it's, it's always a surprise. I mean, these things grow and if they're in the right environment and things that they can eat and feed on, they just get bigger and bigger. That's not the biggest. Look at this thing. Look at this thing, mate.\n\nWhoa. That's like an English bulldog.\n\nHowdy duty. It's bigger than my dog.\n\nOh my god. Bigger than one. My dogs look at his head. What is the weight on that fucker? What does it\n\nSay?\n\nThat's crazy.\n\nYep.\n\nI gotta find another one to add. Fuck me. Hold on.\n\nI gotta weight there.\n\nIt say how big\n\nThat was a record. Of course.\n\nIt's Oh, fat. That fucker is 2.7\n\nGrams. 5.8 pounds. Wow. That looks bigger than 5.8 pounds.\n\nIt does. But it might be a perspective thing either way. I said that\n\nWas the current one.\n\nOh. Show the video. Scroll up so you can see that video. Or make it larger, like when she's holding it. Yeah. It looks like about five pounds. Boy. Have you ever seen when they, there's a lot of horrible videos online where they take toads and they put 'em in a box with mice. You ever see what toads do to mice? No. You would never think that toads are ferocious. Right. You know, you'd never think that toads are basically monsters. These just giant mouth monsters that swallow mice's hole. But they do. They're super aggressive. It's crazy to watch. Jamie. I know you're gonna get one. I just had to\n\nMake sure it was worth pulling\n\nUp. Is this a good one? Yeah, but there's, there's ones where there's a bunch of 'em in boxes. See, this one is kind of weird because he's not freaking out yet.\n\nHe's being sneaky. Oh, what's that? Look at\n\nThat head. See him get excited. Look at his head. I mean, if that thing was giant, like that was a hippopotamus shaped chasing after you. Ah, look how quick that is. How did, how did he get it?\n\nHe must be closer than it\n\nLooks like. He just swallowed 'em whole. Yeah. Oh, watch how quick he does it. Yeah. This\n\nBit here. Oh, it's just one step forward and bang. Yeah,\n\nJust snap. Yeah. Go see if he could find one of them video. Oh, he just inhales them. Like, he literally inhaled him. He's got a little bit of a tongue. Oh, he, he grabbed him with the tongue first. Right? He yanked him in. Oh God. See if you can find those videos where there's a ton of them in a box.\n\nWe're getting two live feedings of the mice like this.\n\nEither way,\n\nThat's a giant bullfrog. It's not a cane to slightly different\n\nGiant African bullfrog either way. Point is they eat mice, they eat 'em whole. Right? And, and how many of 'em are now in Australia? How many million? Oh, here we go. This guy's just gonna go ham. It starts. Oh, he's gonna eat all of them. Look how gross those things are. They look so dumb. Just so mindless and, and gross.\n\nNo, I don't think he's gonna get all of 'em. Video's not long enough.\n\nHe hasn't gotten any of them. I can, what's going on here\n\nPast it,\n\nJust gathering them in a corner. Ugh.\n\nIt's, it's a creepy animal. So and so look, what are the numbers? Like, put that into perplexity\n\nCane toads.\n\nYeah. How many cane toads? Ask our sponsor, how many cane toads are in Australia? And what was the initial deposit? Like? How many They drop off that I had it,\n\nIt was only a couple hundred. And then they bred like 60,000 in 1937. And the answer for now is estimated at 200 million.\n\nMan. And that little flyer that eats the sugar cane, it's still there. Oh\n\nMy god. 200 million. Yeah.\n\nBut see, look, if you see where those that see that cluster of light blue balls, right? They basically in there, in the middle of that, that cluster is where they dropped them to start with. And look at how they've,\n\nWell they're gonna make their way across the whole\n\nCountry. Oh, there you go. 40, 49. So the white one is actually where they put them to start.\n\nWow.\n\nAnd everything else is migration.\n\nAnd by 2000, look how far they've gone. Mm. Wow. What's the plan to get rid of those things?\n\nI'm not sure that they have a cohesive plan. There's no\n\nPlan. Well, that's the problem. If they have a plan, they're gonna bring in some lizard or something. Yeah. In\n\nFrogs that's gonna end up gonna end up, you know, doing something else. Yeah. It's gonna\n\nKill everything\n\nElse. Every single time they've done that. You know, like in New Zealand for example, they introduced the goss bush as a way to have hedging instead of fences. But New Zealand's got a way higher rainfall and sunshine hours than England where it came from. So now it's just everywhere, you know. So beautiful arable farmlands just taken over by Gores. And when it grows in Australia, in New Zealand, it grows thicker and more prickly and much harder to, to deal with. We have the same thing in Australia with plants like Lantana just everywhere, all through the bush, you know, in my lifetime. So in 96 I used to be able to walk through certain areas of my property, just under tall trees with, you know, subtropical ferns and vines on the ground. Now there's many areas of my property that are just impossible. You cannot get through it anymore. 'cause it's choked out with introduced weeds.\n\nWhat is that crazy plant down south that we talked about Once that is overrun some of these forests, it's pretty beautiful, but it's also very creepy to see what it's done. Just like taken over all the trees, all the trees, all the, anything on the ground just covered wisteria. It, it's called kudzu. Kudzu. Yeah.\n\nI'll show you. I'll make sure this is the right stuff. That's\n\nWhat you're talking about? Yeah. That's it. Look at that. Right?\n\nIsn't\n\nThat nuts? Yeah.\n\nLike\n\nThat image is creepy. I mean, that's like a steaming\n\nAt the back of my place, man. I used to have that waterfalls and creeks.\n\nLook at that. It's taking over that whole building. That's crazy. Everything. Yeah. Just where'd they come from?\n\nSee, that's in Fiji.\n\nYeah, it's in the United States though. So what was it, how was it brought in?\n\nChina, Korea, Japan.\n\nOh, did people bring it in on purpose? That's\n\nWhere it's, that's where it's originated from.\n\nSorry. Right. History of us introduction introduced from Japan in 1876. Yeah. New Orleans Exposition. Oh, that's where I heard there's a lot of it. Vine was widely marketed in the southeast as an ornamental plant, and then it just took\n\nOver California.\n\nWow. It's, it's funny when people try to do that.",

There's something to it. As much as I my mind want, my rational mind wants to ignore the possibility, like the randomness of the universe, the size and scope of it all.

Just because there's black holes doesn't mean your fucking, your homework doesn't matter. You know, everything matters. Right. Your whole world, everything matters.

So it's like coffee flavor you put in your mouth\n\nJust like it in\n\nYeah. And you crack that little sucker open. It gives you a little blast\n\nOf flavor. A little, yeah. Little sugar. Almost like a little, yeah. Piece of cupcake. Little pizza candy\n\nIn there for You. Good. Those are fours, right? So it's not bad. Oh lord. That's a nice, I get up\n\nFour's nice if I get up and run outta here. Saw I already couldn't concentrate 'cause of the shooting.\n\nI saw a dude online. He got a a 50 milligram one from overseas. What? Yeah. And he tried it and you know, he was violently ill lying on the ground. Like\n\nA terrible, why would you do that?\n\nWell I think he did it for props, you know, like, so he could get some online cred just for the views. Did it for the gram, did it\n\nWork?\n\nI mean, I guess you it, I watched it. I wanted to, I'm like, you're gonna take a 50. Oh you're fucked dude. And he said, oh my god, it's like drinking battery acid. And then he was lying on the ground at the end of it. It was like, I really fucked up. I made a giant mistake. 'cause it's so much nicotine. 50\n\nMilligrams is crazy. But, but you're so like, so into health and just take such good care of yourself. And I What is the bit what? Like why are I just tell people, oh they're good for you have one. Well what do you think? Like tell me your opinion of these. There's this whole craze, there's\n\nNicotine is not bad for you. Correct. The delivery method is what's bad for you. And the delivery method with cigarettes in particular with cigarettes that have a bunch of chemicals added to them that's even worse. Like the regular cigarettes. Like natural cigarettes I bet are probably not as bad for you. Dr. Suzanne Humphreys, she's a, a physician who was on here was explaining to us like why regular cigarettes are not as bad, but there's still, it's still not good for you, you smoking in your lungs. But nicotine itself is not bad. Nicotine itself is neuroprotectant. Nicotine itself actually is a nootropic. So, which means it's cognitively enhancing. So nootropics are like vitamins that help brain function. And there's a bunch of 'em, like have some here we have some stuff called Alpha Brain. That's great. I've seen that. There's a bunch of companies that make different versions of a nootropic, but there are, there are nutrients that enhance memory and enhance your verbal, verbal memory. So your ability to recall words that can enhance peak alpha flow state. Like they've done like real, they've done two double-blind placebo controlled studies at the Boston Center for Memory with Alpha Brain. It shows more effectiveness than any of the drugs that they had studied over the past, like nine months before they did this. So like, this is pretty impressive. So nicotine does That too? Yeah. Nicotine enhances your memory. Enhances brain function. Enhances it, stimulates you. So there's a lot of benefits to nicotine as a, but the problem is like, how do you take it? How are you taking your nicotine? You know, probably one of the best ways is maybe gum, you know, and these, these things\n\nBecause people are wearing patches now and stuff. Oh, fucking\n\nCrazy people. That's Ron White. He wears a goddamn patch. What you doing Ron? I got a patch on it. I'm smoking. He's got a cigar. He is got a zen fucking animal. But\n\nSo good.\n\nHe's such an animal. But I think there's, there's real benefit to, I know a guy who puts a nicotine patch on for productivity when he writes.\n\nWell that makes sense to me. Like I feel like, 'cause all the songwriters are, you know, right now it's everybody in Nashville's singing and I'm like, oh, I'll try one. And it like really does give you a little\n\nStimulant.\n\nYeah. And also have a lot of words in my head. I need to remember words and I also need to write new words. You should. So anything to help with that.\n\nAnything you want. If you want help with memory. Alpha Brain's a really good one's.\n\nI wanna try that because that's a good one. I just think like at some point too, when you're tired, you know, it just, it feels like you, like you can't, I mean you just saw me lose my train of thought. It's like I don't wanna be on like a bunch of Adderall and stuff. No. I wanna be on, I wanna find a different method to like have my brain functioning. Eat the best it can. These\n\nAre addictive though. And I gotta say different people have different levels of like how addicted they get with these. Like some people can't not have them. I went on vacation, I said I'm gonna go on vacation and not bring any and see what happens. See if I freak out just to see and nothing, zero nothing. It was like I kind of missed them maybe for a day or two. Like wanted one didn't have any. And then after like three days I was like, oh, this is fine. Yeah. It's not, it's not like a physical like, oh my God I'm jonesy.\n\nIt's not like smoking.\n\nI'm a shaken. Yeah. Yeah. But I've, I know people that have tried to get off of 'em that really struggle.\n\nI mean, it, it is addictive. I mean it's nicotine. I\n\nThink the vapes are the hardest to get off of\n\nThe vapes. Like that's, I don't want heat on my voice either, you\n\nKnow? Right. That's, well, vapes aren't really hot, but it is. If you buy them ones that are like in the gas station, like who knows where those are\n\nBeing, but like, but the ones that heat up.\n\nOh yeah. The crazy ones. I like that. Adam Curry. Do you know Adam Curry is, he's the first podcaster. He used to be the MTVV. Oh yeah. Dkng. Yes. Guy with beautiful hair.\n\nYeah.\n\nYes. Good. Good friend of mine. He carries around one of those robot lunchbox vapes. Those big old crazy ones. Yeah. Where you're blowing murder\n\nAnd it makes like noise. It's\n\nLike kind of like a power bar on the side of it. So much. It's so ridiculous. And he blows this giant, but it's all like, he, he fills it with natural oil. So it's air quotes healthy. Oh, air quotes. Yeah. But\n\nThat's what they, that's what people say. They smoke American spirits.\n\nYeah. It's healthy. Come on, there's an Indian on there. Yeah,\n\nExactly.\n\nHow come they get away with that? Is, are American spirits owned by Native Americans? No. No. So how the fuck do they have a Native American on there? Not catch any slack. They do, right? Don't they have\n\nAn's a badass pack? They got in trouble in the past for stuff.\n\nSo did they? Yeah, I'm not,\n\nI'm not getting\n\nInto it. Oh. Getting into tobacco company problems.\n\nHe was like, and Pivot.\n\nDid you ever see that movie The Insider with Russell Crow? I don't think so. It's about a guy who works for a tobacco company that is explaining, he was a chemist and he was explaining how they added all these different things to make it more addictive. And they're trying to kill him in the film. 'cause they don't want that information getting out. Ooh. He's the insider. It's kind of crazy movie and based on a true story. Wow. Yeah. I watch that they, they put a bunch of shit in cigarettes to try to get you hooked. Well,\n\nAnd they do it. Yeah. I mean it works people. It does. That's the hardest one. I feel like it's, it's the most, you hear people talking about trying to quit that and drinking to me like, you know what I mean? Just on the daily. Like I'm in a band so everybody's like, oh I quit now they're all like, do you go to Zen? You got a Zen like Yeah because it's just highly addictive. I guess\n\nIt's, it is, but it's, it's people want something. They just want something to take 'em outta whatever state they're in. Gimme something. Gimme a drink, gimme this, gimme a coffee. Like everybody I know that's an Alcoholic's Anonymous. They all smoke or drink tons of coffee. It's either or both. Yes. Because they're just want to do something. Get me. Something's not gonna make me suck dick for bus fare, but I'm gonna least get a little bit of something different than regular life. I don't wanna be homeless. I don't wanna be cracked out. But yeah, gimme something. Yeah, just gimme a little something. Take me away from wherever I am right now. Yeah.\n\nNot that far away. Just a little bit away.\n\nIt's that little next door. Let me go next door and hide.\n\nI'm gonna start saying that way. I'm like, can I have his in? Can I go? I, I need to go next door.\n\nYeah, I'm gonna go next door just a little bit. I don't wanna go too far away. I could hear everybody but\n\nAm I supposed to like break this little candy thing?\n\nI do. Yeah. I break it right away. It just crack down on that little sucker. What's\n\nIn there?\n\nProbably candy. Ooh, nice. Right. That's\n\nLike a little burst of happiness.\n\nWell burst of flavor.\n\nYeah. Oh wait, next door.\n\nI like those. I like those. That's funny. My buddy Duncan found out that his blood sugar goes up when he vapes. 'cause he was buying those gas station vapes and you know he got, it's terrible. He got type two diabetes 'cause he was eating too much sugar. He's okay, don't worry. But he realized 'cause he monitors his blood glucose that like when he was vaping his blood was going through the roof. I go, okay. Why do you think that is? Like, why do you think it's strawberry flavored? What the fuck do you think's in there, bro? You're eating candy all day. Like you're vaping on sugar. Oh\n\nIt's like sugar. Yeah. Oils. Yeah. Yeah.\n\nIt has to be. Yeah it has to be. I mean if it's like grape flavored or whatever the hell it is, it's like there's some, some also, who knows what kind of oil they're putting in those damn things. It\n\nStinks\n\nPretty. It's probably made in China or somewhere. I watched a video on TikTok of these dudes testing them some. Some dude is just sucking on each one of 'em to make sure they work at the factory.\n\nWhat's gonna happen to him?\n\nI don't know what's gonna happen to you because you're sucking on the same one that he was sucking on. Nobody cleans those things off. You just get 'em at the gas station and stick it right in your mouth. That's\n\nLike a karaoke mic. Yes. That's nasty. So nasty. Okay, I'm spinning this out. Oh, to pause. Pause.\n\nOh you get rid of it. Oh.\n\nGave me, it's like a\n\nBuzz.\n\nYeah. It's like a little bit little.\n\nYeah. A little next you went next door.\n\nYeah. I like that. Yeah. Excuse me. I'm going next door.\n\nYeah. So anyway, nicotine vapes not, I don't think they're good for you folks. Sorry. 'cause people thought they were healthier for you than cigarettes. But it turns out like no, not only are they not. Yeah. Here's this look that, oh God, look he's testing all of 'em. All those cute little pink ones. He's gotta make sure they all work.",

It eviscerated this calve and it, it was still alive and it had eaten some of its organs and they had to kill the calve. And then they're like hunting for this mountain lion and he has a video of him shooting this thing. Dogs chase it up a tree and then he shoots it with a bow and arrow. And then he had it stuffed here and he ate it.\n\nDo you aim, you aim for the heart or the head?\n\nYeah. You aim for the heart and the lungs, whatever is available depending on the position of the mountain lion's arm. Right. Like if the arm is like right here, you wanna, you want to tuck it right behind the shoulder and you're gonna get double lungs. And if the arm is up here, you gonna either get the heart or the lungs depending on where their arm is or whether or not you have a, but that's powerful enough to go through the arm and into the body cavity.\n\nIs there a risk, 'cause maybe this is like an urban myth, but if you hurt, hurt an animal, but you don't kill it, it will come back. Some of them will come back to fuck you up like a kind of revenge movie. No,\n\nJohn Wick of animals.\n\nYeah. I imagine they just run away. They\n\nRun away. Well, it's wild like deer that have survived with an arrow in their body cavity. There was a, a deer skeleton that they found of a deer that they, that someone a hunter killed eventually. And this thing had a arrow that had gone through its body and had turned all into bone. So bone had taken over this arrow and the, the whole ca, there it is. That's what it looked like. Wow.\n\nWow.\n\nIsn't that crazy? Mm. So you could see the broadhead had embedded itself in one of the ribs. And so not only did the deer survive, but its body adapted and grew around the arrow.\n\nWow. Wow. Actually, the reason I said that about the nuts. That is insane about the animal was I know that COVID, particularly crows can remember. They can remember. Oh yeah. And then there's been instances where people have hurt crows and the crows phone away. And then a group of them have attacked the person.\n\nOh yeah. They're really smart. They're, they're super and ravens, I think that are, they're actually different than crows. And they're even smarter than crows. Do you know there's a parrot Who was that parrot? That brave parrot? Yeah. Who told us about that? Who was that the other day? Was that Palmer? Palmer Lucky? I think so. I think\n\nSo. Oh, is that the dude with the helmet? Yes. Holy shit. That helmet, bro.\n\nBro, that helmet's nuts. That helmet's nuts. This guy, that guy was, every now and then I get to sit down with someone and they start talking. I go, whoa, he, this guy's fucking crazy smart. Like weirdly smart. Like, oh, okay, I got it. I got it. Like, tell me what you're doing. And he was telling us about this parrot that actually would speak like a human toddler and new colors, new numbers. Could say things could and would communicate\n\nAfrican gray. Yeah, yeah. Yeah. African grays. They have a, they, they can have the IQ of a 4-year-old child. That\n\nIs nuts. Yeah. When you see this thing talking, you're like, yeah.\n\nAnd their imitation of sounds is like\n\nPerfect. Dead\n\nOn. Yeah. Dead on. Yeah.\n\nBut you have to be around them all the time.\n\nRight, right, right. You\n\nHave a twin that you gotta take with you everywhere you go. Yeah.\n\nReally? Because they just get pulled and fuck, fuck. You can fuck shit up.\n\nAnd then they, they're too smart. They actually start like chopping their own wings off and shit like that. Yeah. They get depressed because they don get stimulation depress, they get depressed. They really need a lot of stimulation. Really? Yeah. They're like humans. I thought about owning app para, but I just traveled too much. Yeah. You\n\nDon't know. You don't want that in your life. That's too much work.\n\nIt's, it's a commitment. Yeah. If\n\nYou leave it alone, it would be sad too. Yeah.\n\nBut that's what I'm saying. Yeah. They\n\nGet mad. I had a buddy of mine who had a parrot and when he would leave it, he would come home and start screaming, where the fuck were you? Like, he wasn't really saying that, but it was like, that was what it was saying. Yeah. It was, was screaming.\n\nWhy get married when you've got that? Right.\n\nYeah. And then he had to, upon coming home, immediately take it out and take it out and like put it on his shoulder. Right. Or put it in his hand. And if you put it down for a second it would start getting pissed off. It's crazy. I'm like, dude, he goes, I know it's a lot. He goes, I didn't think it was gonna be this much. It was like, it was a lot of work. Yeah.\n\nJoe, I'm not, hope I'm not being polite. Have you got any of those cigars where all we smoke? I would love a cigar.\n\nLet's go baby.\n\nIt's a weird thing to ask to be. These are really good. I should have said, if you offer us a cigar, we'll accept one. Come on man.\n\nPlease. Thanks, brother. We have a big ass humid door. There is a, oh, I\n\nDidn't bring my light out\n\nOver there. Some here. Right here.\n\nOh, bonobo chimps are very interesting like that as well.\n\nThey're the weirdest, right? Because they just fuck all the time. This might, might need some juice. Let me give you a little juice.\n\nGo\n\nFor it. They're weird because it's like, okay, so chimps can be either hippies or they can be, you know, like the worst barbarians in human history. Well, it's\n\nLike us.\n\nJust like us. Yeah. That's what's weird. 'cause like, but also the bonobos, like they don't have any, they have one rule. The rule is the mom won't fuck the son. That's it. It's\n\nA good rule. So yeah. It's a good fucking rule man. But they're a\n\nBunch of sister fuckers. They're a bunch of sister fuckers and daughter fuckers. Yeah.\n\nBut they're not motherfuckers. They're\n\nProbably dad fuckers too. They're probably fucking, they're probably doing gay sex too. They, they, they seem wild. They're just having a good time. But\n\nThey, so they're homophobic.\n\nNo, not at all. And they solve all their problems with that. Do\n\nYou need to cut these ones? Yeah. How do\n\nYou It opens like a door.\n\nOh, alright.\n\nRight here. And then you pull those.\n\nBut you know they can learn sign language. Oh yeah.\n\nYou know what's interesting though? They don't ask questions.\n\nSo they're like men. Ah.\n\nBut the parrot did.\n\nThe parrot did. Yeah.\n\nThe parrot asked questions. The parrot had some questions about how things work.\n\nThe African grays are incredibly intelligent. Yeah. Incredibly intelligent.\n\nWell, what I'm interested in is what happens when we can start really decoding dolphin language with ai. Right. And once they really understand what they're saying, then things are gonna get very strange.\n\nLight it. And\n\nYou know, because like, what are they, did they, I mean they're really smart, like silly smart. Like dolphins have enormous frontal lobes.\n\nOh yeah. Man. And communication. They\n\nHave dialects. They have,\n\nThey have dialects. Yeah.\n\nThey sound different. Different\n\nParts of the world. That makes sense. I mean that makes sense. Right? The different, slightly different.\n\nWell, on that note, you think, what about whales? Yeah. Whales brains are literally bigger than us. Yeah. They're, they're enormous. So if we're talking about brain size equals I, which I'm\n\nIt's brain size relative to body master. Yeah.\n\nOh is it? Yeah.\n\nYeah. Because you need a big fucking brain to run a big body. Yeah. Right,\n\nRight. Which is also the argument for why the Neanderthals might have been dumber than us.\n\nWell they were from\n\nWhat we think. They don't know that though. Really? Yeah. They had pretty big brains. What's weird about them is they also had language. Yeah. They had writing and or they had, they definitely had tool making. They had\n\nWriting Don't, I don't think they had\n\nWriting. Writing. No, they didn't have writing. They had language. But they, they did do art. That's what it is. Mm. Wasn't writing necessarily, but they drew stuff and they had a brain that's bigger than ours. But they were also like jacked. They had bigger eyeballs. There was a guy that, this was a, there was a crazy theory that I'm sure is horseshit, but it was cool. Like he made Neanderthals look way different. This guy had a theory like, 'cause we're just, we've never seen a live neanderthal. And he was like, what if we are getting it totally wrong? And what if they were more gorilla looking\n\nThan, but we have the skulls and skeletons down\n\nThere. We have some stuff and they also think they have red hair. This guy was, it's a cracked theory. Right, right. But it was a fun theory. But one of the more fun aspects of this guy's crack theory was that their eyeballs are so much bigger than ours. Their sockets are really big. He's like, what if they have night vision like a deer or like a wolf, you know? Which is totally possible for a primate to have. It's not like, it's not like there's anything about being that kind of a mammal that would exclude you from being able to develop night vision eyesight. Are\n\nThere, are there primates that have that?\n\nI don't\n\nKnow because there's mammals for sure. Yeah.\n\nBut what, yeah, let's ask, let's ask perplexity. Perplexity.\n\nIs\n\nThere any, what is that called? When they have night vision when animals are nocturnal and they could see well at night, you know that thing that like when you're driving and you're see\n\nA fox or something? Yeah,\n\nYeah, yeah. The reflective eyes that they all have. Yeah.\n\nYeah. What is that? I don't, what's\n\nThat called? I dunno. I dunno.\n\nWe should know.\n\nDo you know there's a very interesting theory about ne neanderthals and homo sapiens is there are some people who think that we are one of the few species or one of the only species that has a capacity to deceive Oh and trick. So there was, there's a, there's a theory going around that, that\n\nThe monkeys do that monkeys trick other monkeys into thinking there's an eagle coming. So they steal fruit. Do\n\nThey? Yeah. That's interesting.\n\nThey yell out the sound for eagle and then all the monkeys run away and then they steal the fruit.\n\nOh really? Yeah. Wow.\n\nSo here it is. Monkey primates, the tarsier and the night monkey al monkey are the species with the best vision adapted to night conditions. Right. Okay. So they do. Yeah. See, look at that largest eyes relative to body size of any mammal. So it's something about having a large eye. Because if you, okay. So despite lacking a tape, ofum lucidum, the reflective layer that cause eye shine in many nocturnal animals. Oh, that's what that is. The retina is containing extremely high density of rod photoreceptors, which are highly sensitive to dim light. This allows tarsiers to detect and track prey such as insects in near darkness. And they can see in light as low as 0.001 lux. Similar to moonless nights. Damn. So there's a bunch of different little primates. Oh,\n\nLori's.\n\nBut why, I mean, if you were living in a time, especially if you didn't have fire, if you're living in a time where, you know, there's no roofs, like you're, you're, you're hunting, you're outside at night, you're probably spending as much time as you can hunting. 'cause Neanderthals weren't gatherers, they weren't farmers. So all they did was hunt. Mm. So they probably had some sort of night vision, which would've wild.\n\nYeah. The thing that I find interesting is what is there, I think there's certain, the average person in Europe has around 3% Neanderthal,\n\nDNAD,\n\nNAD three, 3% a if you are African zero. Right. So it's, it's just really interesting. And you see some people, and they're more, they kind of have more than neanderthal kind of appearance too.\n\nYeah, for sure.\n\nAnd then other people. And you go, what, what does that actually give you that 3%? What does it do? Is there any discernible difference whatsoever? Does it make you perhaps more athletic, more re more resilient?\n\nIt's a good question. I mean, I think it would depend. I mean there's also a bunch of other weird strains of human that existed that there, you know, like Dennis Ovs and there's, there's quite a few other ones. Yeah,\n\nYeah.\n\nYeah. You know, who knows what if, I think the Dennis Ovs, I think they definitely got into the gene pool too. I forget who they were saying had a high levels of Dennis Ov DNA, it might have been aboriginal Australians. Hmm. But you know, there's, there was a bunch of different types of human, you know, we just figured out how to be the kiest and the most conniving. And I think probably the most clever,\n\nWell, harra, have you read the Sapiens? His thesis is we, we worked out how to work together beyond the 150 done by number. That was his, his idea is basically we created these shared myths. Religion, money, whatever nation, all of the stuff that we all agree is real that, you know, it feels real. Right. But we, the reason we out-competed other species is that we could cooperate across beyond our immediate tribal group. And that's the reason. That\n\nMakes sense. That makes sense. I mean, there's also, human beings have a very distinct desire to make better things all the time. And if you have that and you're applying that to weapons, you're gonna make the best weapons. Right. You know, I don't know if Neanderthals had that. You know, did they have, I mean, if you're gonna make stuff, right? If you're gonna make tools, you must have some creativity and some desire to innovate. And\n\nCuriosity.\n\nYeah. Curiosity, desire to innovate. 'cause we know that, look, there's certain animals that will use weapons. Right. There's certain, like there's a, a famous photograph of an orangutan that's spearfishing. Have you ever seen that? Yeah. Photo. Mm. But it learned how to do it from people and you know, they'll use rocks to break open crabs and they'll do stuff like that. But they're not fastening an arrowhead No. On a stick or a spear. And they're making it with flint. The inter halls did that. So they got to a level where they're like, okay, this is like craftsmanship. Like this is sophisticated craftsmanship. And it would also probably indicate some sort of a complex language that you could explain where you get the, the gut that you turn into fiber that you use to tie the arrowhead to the stick. Like they were, they were doing, they was doing some high level stuff. Yeah.\n\nFor,\n\nSorry,\n\nGo ahead. For a primate.\n\nYeah. I would imagine also a lot of the innovation comes once you have the greater revolution because there's now surplus food. Yeah. And so you can afford to have a bunch of guys sitting around, not hunting, but like thinking about shit or inventing things or you know, making things in a different way. You know?\n\nDid you see that discovery of a skull that was 500,000 years older than they thought was the origin of human beings? So that it potentially pushes back the original homosapiens to 500,000 years? No.\n\nEarlier.\n\nIs that real? Yeah.\n\nYeah. They think it's, it might push back the date. I mean it's an under debate I'm sure. But I think they might push back the date of the rival of homo sapiens to a million years.\n\nWow.\n\nYeah.\n\nBut it just shows, you know, it's nuts. How,\n\nThis is just nuts.\n\nHow little do we know about ancient civilization? Stonehenge in the uk, which is this iconic, you know? Have\n\nYou been\n\nNo, I haven't. No, you\n\nYou should go. It's\n\nReally special energy\n\nThere, man. Yeah. It's really impressive. And like Constance said, there's a special energy and it's, it's a profoundly moving place. When you visit it, you feel as if you have a connection to something else. It's like going to the pyramids. But they have no idea. They have a rough idea of where the stones might have come from, but they've got no idea how they got there. How they erected them. Yeah.\n\nWho you should go man. Joe Rogan arrested a heath airport. That would be a great fucking story. Boy,\n\nI'm sure they can find some tweets\n\nFor us\n\nBrother. Or just the things that I've said.",

In reality, if you look at it, it's a burden. But, you know, there's a lot of people dying of lung cancer who've never had a cigarette. So we haven't really solved that. We don't really know where that's coming from. But in reality, the burden on our healthcare system is obesity and all the problems that come from obesity. That's the biggest. Yeah. We allow food production systems that we know to be extremely unhealthy and very bad. We just allow them to continue on. You know, we've got items of quote unquote food that have been tested and turns out there's no actual food in this. It's just, you know, a manufactured product. I think the, the famous one here was the, the Twine thing. Right? When they actually got around to looking at what was in a twine, they realized that every single part of it was completely unhealthy. Yeah.\n\nIt's just mostly sugar, right? Yeah. Yeah. But Twinkies are delicious and I think you should be able to buy Twinkies, you know what I mean? So I, I'm on both sides of it. I'm a healthy person. I eat 99% of my food is very healthy, but I think you should be able to do whatever the fuck you want. It's just education is the most important thing. And letting people know what they're, and then teaching people some discipline and how to be able to exercise some control over yourself.\n\nSo I was 126 kilos when I finished Nuremberg.\n\nMm.\n\nI'm a hundred 0.9 right now.\n\nThat's amazing. Congratulations. Well,\n\nA lot of that.\n\nYou look great by the way. Thanks. Really do\n\nA lot of that is because you introduced me to your mate Brigham\n\nFrom Waist Towell. Yeah. Yeah.\n\nAnd so I've probably connected with them about five times since that first time we went. And the real benefit that I'm getting that I think, right, because I'm not, not completely over the science, but it seems to be with these injections that I've been getting into my shoulders, into my knees, but also IVs that it's calmed down my body's inflammation. You know, I think we talked before about just how many old injuries I carry, you know, and how like the injuries in my shoulders have a deeply arthritic, but we can now see in an ultrasound over time how, what was messy a year ago and like big thick bands of of arthritis now it's just lessened. You know, probably by about 70% on one area of my right shoulder, probably about 90%. So my range of motion, if we'd done this last year, would've been about there. Right. But now is fucking rock and roll something, you\n\nKnow what I mean? Isn't that great? It's all\n\nGoing good, you know? I know. It's amazing. And like, just feeling like the musculature starting to build and everything. I'm taking it really slowly. And that was one of the things I was worried about with Highlander because jumping into that role with the shooting date coming, it was like, man, I've gotta do, I've gotta do three workouts a day. I gotta, you know, and that for me is a bad recipe because yeah, I can, I can do that for X amount of time, but once I stop, I'm gonna stop completely. You know? And what I want to do is I wanna make all these changes and make it a long-term situation. So I think the Waste two world was a great call for me because it's calmed down a bunch of stuff. It's taken a bunch of pain away, you know, so I can go and work out and not have to suffer for two or three hours afterwards. Yeah. You know, you know, I'm still picking up injuries 'cause I've gotta face the fact I'm 61. Yeah. You know, like the other day I'm doing my cat guitar dinosaur trying to get this fricking move going on. A fricking tore the tendon here on the ulnar. Ugh. So that's gonna be bad for sword fighting, but I'm trying to fix that without having to have a, a surgical,\n\nHow bad is it torn?\n\nIt's only a little bit really, you know. Okay.\n\nYou just gotta make sure you don't overuse it while it's healing. Can you brace it? Well\n\nThe, the, the problem I've got is I've got X amount of time to claim the skill and either way, right. If I do the rehab exercises without doing surgery, if it fails, I'm now falling right on production and you know, of re torn or something. Right.\n\nBut I can help you with that. Just do this skill slowly.\n\nYeah.\n\nHere's the thing about skills. Skills that you learn slowly. You can translate into high speed quickly. Yeah. Because you develop a neural pathway. So instead of using an actual sword, use a foam sword use like one of those little fucking noodle things that people put in the pool. Use that. So you're just, just develop them. When I was teaching martial arts, one of the things that I always tell people is don't try to do it quickly when I show you something, I want you to do it slowly.\n\nThat's exactly what I did. Yeah. I'm in a car park and we were talking about the speed of something and I went, oh yeah, so you get sh and I went, oh fuck.\n\nAnd I\n\nKnew I to, but I just put my sword away and I kept the conversation going. Didn't mention it, but I got home and I was like, oh fuck.\n\nOh, you rushed, you didn't warm up. Yeah.\n\nWell the thing is we were warm, but it was a thing that I just, just in that split second, I thought, I wonder what it's like to go full speed. Oh. And I did it and I, and I just like, no way too early. But you're absolutely right. Pace is deceptive. Yeah. If you learn something, I mean, you know, that's like that old fashioned sort of stuff with with with the karate I first did when I was a kid, you know, they aim for you to do 10,000 of something before you have to use it in an actual competitive fight. You know?\n\nYeah. People who train people with guns have a saying, slow is smooth, smooth is fast.\n\nRight? Yeah.\n\nYeah. Absolutely. You want herky jerky movements and with martial arts and specifically sword fighting, it's, there's very specific movements that you're learning. And if you learn those movements slow as you speed up, you'll be going along the right pathway. And when I would teach people kicks in particular because it's a weird thing to learn how to kick something. Like you've gotta do it slowly. 'cause if you try to muscle it, you're gonna develop a bad habit that's gonna keep you from achieving full power because you want a proper technique. Yeah. And\n\nYou have to process where your balance is. Yeah. You know, what you, how you're pushing your force, but how you retain Yeah. You know, the ability to reset. Yeah.\n\nYeah. Juujitsu as well. People that learn by drilling, they get way better, way quicker by doing it flowing and doing it more easy and play like the Gracie's always say keep it playful. Yeah.\n\nLike that's, well see the thing is I know all this stuff, but I was in such a point of weariness that I was just trying to please people. Right. Oh. And so I muck myself up and you know, but I've got a bit of time now for it to heal and for me to start and actually do like, I like to do, you know,\n\nHave you visited Brigham while you're here?\n\nYeah. Yeah. I saw him missed that. Okay, great. Yeah, he's looking great.\n\nYeah, he looks great, right? Yeah. He is looking good.\n\nHe'll look you up the new, the new place. And now here's the thing. We talk about this and your listeners would probably, you know, it's expensive. No two ways about it. So it's possibly not at everybody's grasp what the sort of things that I'm doing. But I think, I'm not sure if this is absolutely right, but I think, you know, one of his sort of fervent ambitions Brigham, is to make it more available. Yes. You know, because this should be, this is cutting edge medicine. Yes. You know, if we can sort of write things in our bodies with an injection as opposed to an operation, you know, the problem I had in my left shoulder, I go and see my shoulder surgeon who fixed it while I was doing Cinderella, man. And so I did two operations with this guy, one in 2001 and the second one in 2004. But it's always had a sort of problem. And, and he did say at the time, after the second operation, that he had to cut a few corners and it would probably cause me problems later on in life. So I probably went to see him about five or six years ago and he said, okay, so you are, this shoulder is at a point of arthritis. Now what we have to do is we have to cut through the muscle bar, we have to pop out the humeral head of your arm bone. We have to shave off the top of the humal head and then we have to put a carbon fiber cap and then we have to put it back in. So everything back up, you've got about 12 months of rehab. Right. Just sounds wrong. You know, it just sounds wrong. It's like, you know, so this process that I've been going through with Brigham, basically having the effect of layering so I can now see that if the arthritis was that deep, it's now this deep, you know, it's still there. I haven't solved it yet, but I'm giving my body what it needs to make it better.\n\nAlso, there's new breakthroughs almost every week, right. And these new breakthroughs, they're, they're able to achieve the, the, they're, they're growing actual cartilage on people that were bone on bone. Right? So they're, they're developing new methods to regenerate tissue. That's the cushioning in between your, your knees and your elbows and all these things that were, and shoulders that we're requiring people to get those horrific things. Putting an artificial joint in place. 'cause everything is so arthritic.\n\nThat's one of the things that does trouble me greatly in for this country health medical systems to benefit everybody. Something has perverted here where, you know, the drug that I might need that I can buy for $50 for a month supply in Australia is two and a half thousand dollars for a month here. Yeah. Come on man. I know what's going on. It's crazy. You know, and where's, see you've got all these elected representatives here and this country's got, you know, a lot, you know, that's what you should be working on man. You know? Yeah.\n\nBut they can't\n\nBecause everybody's got their, their hands\n\n500 back. Everybodys their hands tied. Yeah. They're all got their, including the media. That's the crazy things. The amount of money they spend on advertising for the media that really just serves the purpose of now the media can't criticize the pharmaceutical drug companies. Right.\n\nWild. Yeah. Wild. It's interesting. It's because, you know, I get back here as you know, you know, my girlfriend's from New Orleans and you know, we're sitting and watching TV here and she's now seeing America from the outside. 'cause she spends most of the time traveling with me. And we don't spend that much time in, within America. You know, we live in Australia, but we've been, I've been working mainly in, in, in Europe the last few years. So she's now coming back to her country, but she's got fresh eyes and she's sitting there the other night she was watching something. She came out, she said, I've just watched like 12 ads for drugs. Right. Just one after the other, after the other, after the other. You know what, what's this tiny little problem that you might have? Or you know, if I can say it in a certain way to make you think that you've got it, bang, I got a drug for it. Bang, bang. You know? And yeah. I mean 600,000 plus people in this country in the next 12 months will go bankrupt because of their medical bills. You know how many people will go bankrupt in Australia because of their medical bills in the next 12 months?\n\nZero. Zero.\n\nYeah.\n\nYeah. It's one of the biggest problems we have. You know, and the idea that you would let that happen and not do anything about it because you're bought and paid for by these enormous companies is kind of insane. Yeah. It's insane. And they're trying, they're trying to do something about that, you know, and RFK junior's fighting an uphill battle trying to do something about that. But it's a captured industry.\n\nYeah. Yeah.\n\nAnd you know,\n\nThe\n\nFact socialized medicine, fact,\n\nProbably the fact the largest western economy is punishing its citizens in that way. Yeah. Just beggars belief. That's crazy that healthcare isn't such a principle thing. 'cause if, if, if we're not looking after ourselves and aiming for the longest life, what's the point of the human existence kind of thing. You know what I mean? So that should be a principle. Everybody's health should be a principle focus of our elected representative. Well\n\nSaid. Russell Crowe, you're the fucking man.

Our chicken. So I'm just being there. He's like cooking and I'm just like, I'm painting my chickens right now. Always\n\nChickens.\n\nI don't know why. I have no idea. It's easy. That's why. Fate. It's\n\nFate. You're designed to be the greatest folk. Art chicken.\n\nThat's my next song. Folk art. Fake painter\n\nOf all time. Folk art fate. Imagine if that's what it is. Like there's something that compelling. You tell the world about chicken folk art.\n\nI guess. So. Here\n\nWe go. You watch chick. Do you have chickens?\n\nYeah, I do have chickens. I have\n\nChickens.\n\nI love chickens.\n\nChickens are great.\n\nRight? They're awesome.\n\nThey're really cute. They're the ladies. I go in the yard like, hi\n\nLadies. The ladies. That's why I call 'em. I say, Hey ladies, I give them all the scraps. They love everything from the table. Like any leftovers. It's funny to watch 'em though 'cause they're like picky. Like the other day I thought they would eat like leftover breakfast. Casserole wouldn't touch it really? But they were all, they didn't eat the biscuits. Chickens don't like biscuits.\n\nWell, maybe they know that breakfast casserole is eggs and they're like, Jesus Christ, this lady's fucking nuts. She's trying to turned us into cannibals.\n\nRidiculous. Because I didn't think about that.\n\nRight. Maybe it's like,\n\nOh no, what have I done to my ladies?\n\nIt might be like a natural reaction to them. I'll tell you what they go crazy for is mice. Have you ever seen what, oh yeah. Yeah. So this is how I found out. I used to have a house in California that my wife, she changed our back fence. It was a wrought iron fence. And she changed it to glass. And when she did, she, she signed a death warrant for a bunch of hawks. And they kept slamming into that fucking glass. And like three of them died in our yard. And one of them got kd but survived. And I was on the road and she had told me about it. And they'd taken this, this hawk and they had put it in a box. And when I got back we got 'em what's called pinkies. And what pinkies are, are these little baby mice that have, they feed 'em to lizards and snakes. Like that's what they're for. Like when you go to the pet store, they sell you these things. They're not weaned from their mother. And you feed 'em the snakes. I know it's dark. So they, they bought a bunch of 'em and fed this hawk, these little baby mice. And it ate all of them except one. And my daughters were very young at the time and they're like, we wanna keep that mouse. We wanna raise it. I'm like, honey, you can't, it's not gonna live. Like it's not weaned from its mother. It won't survive. I go, I'm just gonna go see if the chickens will eat it. I put this thing down and these chickens attacked like they were raptors from Jurassic Park. One chicken grabbed it and they all chased her around. They were\n\nStealing it from what in the world are you saying?\n\nPulling it out of her mouth? It is the, they are so ferocious. Like you've never seen anything like a chicken with a mouse.\n\nI have never heard this in my life.\n\nI'm gonna show you a video. And this video, oh, do I wanna see this? There's a bunch of videos of cats with mice. So, so this is a mouse. And why, why do these chickens? My god. They just kill this mouse. And look, they all attack each other trying to steal the mouse away from the one chicken. And has it, do they eat? Oh, they eat it quick. Yeah, they devour it. Hmm. So there's another mouse in there that they don't know about yet. So see there's one with a cat. So the cat is playing with the, the mouse. Like, you know, cats don't kill it or an they wanna play. And this chicken just runs over and snatches it from the cat. Like,\n\nFuck you. I have never heard this in my life. So\n\nLook, the cat has a mouse and chicken's like, gimme that bitch. They just go, look, it's got a mouse. And the cat's like, Jesus Christ, you guys are psychos.\n\nWell, who knew? Yeah.\n\nWell because they're dinosaurs. That's who they are. They're just dinosaurs that are really small that survive the impact of the asteroid.\n\nI also love dinosaurs, so maybe that's why. That's it. Chickens. I'm called to paint my folk chicken.\n\nYou just don't realize how ruthless they are until\n\nYou see, I've never heard this in my life. This is blowing 'em. I'm country as a bump. And like I've never heard this. They\n\nDestroy mice. Yeah. Dang. Destroy 'em. They love 'em. They tear 'em apart.\n\nWell, I'm not gonna go do that, but I'm glad I know that now.\n\nLike nothing I've ever seen before. We also saw a mouse that got loose in the chicken coop once they, we had a big chicken coop and a mouse went in there and I saw these chickens just tear that mouse\n\nUp. Well the ma casserole is not offensive to them\n\nEating their own babies.\n\nThey're not, we don't have a rooster.\n\nWell I know, but they don't know that you're right. You know, they brooded sometimes\n\nI think baby know. I just let 'em sometimes. And I'm like, do you? Well I just like, sometimes they look at me like, let me just sit on this. Like, like, okay, you can have it. That's your egg out.\n\nYeah. But they pluck their feathers out.\n\nI know. They, it's a lot.\n\nThey get real. They get real. It, it makes you sad. It's like they wanna be a mommy. They do. Yeah. And you don't let 'em, we had a rooster once, but he did not last.\n\nI do not enjoy having roosters. They're roosters soul\n\nFuckers. They're me. Yeah. He attacked my wife and she's like, we're done. Me\n\nToo. Mine attack me. I'm out on rooster.\n\nYeah, they're they're assholes. Yeah. And but they're doing it because they're trying to protect their hens. Like they don't know that you're okay. No, they just think this big fucking thing is moving around their hens. Like this giant person\n\nThing. They're also mean to the hint. Real mean. They're they're mean brutal. Ripping their feathers out. I'm like, I can't do it.\n\nYeah. They're nasty. They're,\n\nHow many do y'all have? Chickens?\n\nWe have 15. 15 or\n\n16. Y'all name 'em.\n\nYes. I don't name 'em, but my daughter girls and my wife names them. But the rooster, he, we only let him got, he got to maturity and then we gave him to a friend. We're like, this motherfucker can't, no, I was gonna kill him. They're mean.\n\nYeah.\n\nHe attacked me. I went into the, I was like, you just gotta like, show him who's boss. And he is like, no, no, you're not boss. I'll attack you too, bitch. Yeah, exactly. He attacked me and I was like, bitch, like it. I'll fucking kill you. And so to avoid killing him, I gave him away. Well that's good because I was totally ready to kill him. Yeah. Because when I'd go in there, he'd face off against me and just leap at me and\n\nAt\n\nMe. Every\n\nYeah. Might, might attack me too. And dad dealt with it. I don't know what happened to him, but dad dealt with it.\n\nSoup. Turned with the soup. Yeah. That's the thing about roosters too. I guess he can't like just outright eat 'em. They're really tough. So if you do kill 'em, you gotta like, either slow cook 'em or turn 'em into soup.\n\nWell we, we probably did. He didn't tell me\n\nI had a landscaper back when I lived in LA who he used to fight chickens and he took me over his place once.\n\nI hate that.\n\nIt was crazy.\n\nI hate it. Yeah.\n\nHe had like a hundred, a hundred roosters.\n\nWe have done some boxers my nation has done. We're not just, we don't just help dogs. We help all animals. But dogs are focused. But like we've helped break up some chicken rings the past. It's\n\nKind of the crazy that it's still, it's still around.\n\nIt's awful. There's some, it's always out. Like we have a farm in Tennessee and there's a whole, this is whole farm like down the road and it's, they keep him in tiny cages. I just hate it. And every time we report him, every time they just pay the fine. You know what I mean?\n\nWell, it's a part of the culture that's the problem. And they all gamble on it. I know he was Mexican and you know, from Mexico and he had all these friends that lived in this neighborhood where he lived in like, you might as well have been in Mexico. It was crazy. Everything was in Spanish. And when I went over his place, it's like his buddy, we went over his buddy's place. His buddy had like a hundred cages in the backyard in a pit where they would take the roosters. Awful. Yeah. And they put spurs on 'em. So they put\n\nThese like, it's so terrible. I mean, knives\n\nOn their claws.\n\nWe, we try to like, we got to be part of like some of the But when you confiscate like that many they use mean Yeah. I mean you can't Yeah. And reintroduce them into the world. Like Right. You know what I mean? They're taught to be mean. They're bred for that.\n\nYeah. And they'll br they'll breed champion roosters from champion other roosters.\n\nLet's just stick to our little backyard hens. How about that?\n\nYeah. It's just, it's a weird thing because like their, their culture has been, they fight them and then they take the loser and they cook 'em. Yeah. And you know, he was making it seem like it was no big deal. And it was like, to them it was their gambling recreation. Yeah. They would all gather around and guys would come from long distances to bring their chickens to fight.\n\nI hate it.\n\nYeah. To me it doesn't freak me out as much as dog fighting. Dog fighting drives me nuts. 'cause pit bulls are the, they're look, they're very dangerous because they have a very high parade drive and they often don't, they confuse children with other animals. They don't. But as pets, they are the most loyal. They're just, they're the most\n\nLoving,\n\nThey're sweetest\n\nKind.\n\nThey love you to death. They love you so much. But there's so many bad ones and so many ones that are raised just to fight. And that part of our culture, that part of society, like the the underground dog fighting part is like, how can you do that to a dog? Like how can you do that to the best animals? Yeah. It's the scum\n\nOf the earth is what it is. I feel like I have some friends that are huge into pit bull rescue and when they're either rehabilitated or just they get a bad rap period. Right. Like, like say any, any metro shelter you go to, it's 90% pit bulls because people are afraid. Yeah. But they're, they get such a bad reputation. But there are some amazing pities that weren't ever in the fighting greens. Right. They were just overbred and you know, you know, taking it out of a confiscation of a, of a hoarding situation or breaking up the fighting rings and it's the mama dog that's just been having puppies and like Yeah. I just wish people would at least open their minds and hearts to like, there are some amazing pities out there or pity mixes. You know, there\n\nAre, but there are also very dangerous. I\n\nGet it. I know they are. They\n\nGo around other dogs. They will fight those dogs to the death.\n\nI think you're, that's the problem. They have to be vetted. It has to be a well vetted shelter or adoption. You know.\n\nBut the problem is oftentimes you don't know their behavior until they're around other dogs. Yeah. Like I've had dogs that were great around people. Yeah. And I get them around any dog and their hackles would go up and they immediately wanted to fight. Yeah. And you're like, oh god. And then you're the asshole. 'cause your dog is like pulling on the leash and you're like, I'm sorry. Let me get 'em outta here.\n\nRight. I know.\n\nThey, they're dangerous. They're dangerous in that regard because they really are bred to fight. And\n\nI think it takes a special household and owner too to really Yes. Kind of handle a dog like that. Like\n\n100%.\n\nOur best friends, Gwen, she's in my band and her and her husband are long time pit bull rescue family. And he, they just know how to like deal with them and they come around our dogs, they're fine, everything's fine. But it's definitely an alpha male out. Like they kind of show 'em who boss right away and Yeah. And they sort of understand the food chain of the house. You know what I mean?\n\nYeah. There's dogs that are great dogs, but they just need a lot of attention. Like if you have a German shepherd Yeah. Or a Belgium malis, you gotta give those things something to do.\n\nYeah. You gotta know what kind of breed you're getting too. Yeah. Like I feel like people, I always preach, adopt, don't shop. But I still think you within the adoption, like really need to go, I'm gonna spend some time with this dog. I'm gonna talk to his foster family. I'm gonna foster it. Just to really understand what kind of breed you're getting. If you want like a lazy, cuddly thing, but still protect or kid a Pyrenees. You know what I mean? Right. Just know what you're getting. Like just understand like as my household ready. 'cause there's a lot of the, what breaks my heart the most is the like owner surrenders and the returns Yeah. At the shelters. You know what I mean? It's like Yeah. You didn't think through what you were right doing and\n\nThen the dog already thought it had a home and now\n\nYou bring 'em in. Right. Because you did. You wanted a lazy dog and you got a cow dog and it needs to run like\n\nGreat. Pyrenees are great because they're kind of a combination of like a lab and a protector dog. Yes. They're a great little balance. Yeah. Like I have a friend who has a Pyrenees and it's like such a good dog. And he's like, listen man, if coyotes come around here, this fucking dog. Oh\n\nYeah. We're not, we're\n\nNot fo them up. Yep. I go, really? And he goes like, oh yeah. Like you, you ain't never seen a change of personality like this dog when it sees a coyote,\n\nBut then they're like laid up on the couch, the legs in air. Oh, the\n\nSweetest. Just rub my bat under your knee.\n\nHe is the best.\n\nLike a re like I have a golden who's he's the best. Unless you're a squirrel. And then he's, he's hell\n\nThen he's\n\nHe then he is a demon. Yep. Exactly. He's, he's squirrel killer. But other than that he's the sweetest boy. He's just so nice to everybody. Everybody who comes over the house, like you're my best friend.\n\nGoldens are the best.\n\nThey're so sweet.\n\nBut I love 'em all. I love 'em all. We have a chihuahua. I mean, I, I mean you, you getting a chihuahua, you know what you're getting. Yeah. Mean as hell\n\nAnd nervous.\n\nOh my God. I mean she's 16 and blind and she still tries to bite. She don't know where you are. But she's like, but I could get you,\n\n16 is old\n\nAnd blind is a bat. But\n\nYou know. Oh my god.\n\nSenior dog house over here.\n\nHave you had her since she was a baby? Yep.\n\nWow. We doctor her from a shelter when she was like eight weeks old. Aw. We got two seniors now. But seniors I've lost. I was crazy dog lady when my husband met me and I had eight rescues, like wow. It seems crazy now. But it, I have farm and land and three were Pyrenees, two golden mixes and then three little, I don't know what's, and I've lost one every year for six years. And so after this, we have two seniors left. And my husband's like, my heart can't take this. Like he never had dogs growing up. Oh, he loves dogs. But he was like, this is awful. Like ever since we met, we've lost one. 'cause they're stair step in age and Yeah. So I'm like, I need a, my heart needs a break a little bit. It's hard.\n\nYeah. It's hard when they die. It's like, it's, it's so hard. So close to them. And they only lived like to\n\nBe 15, not long enough.\n\n15 or 13. And then it's over.\n\nThey're like, put here to show us true love. I know. They really are.\n\nMeanwhile they're not, meanwhile what they are is like, that's wild. I'm in, we took wolves and turned them into bitches. That's what really, really what happened. Like I have a King Charles spaniel. You know one of those. He's the sweetest. That's my little\n\nCharlie. Is that Charlie? Okay. That's\n\nCharlie. Charlie. He is the sweetest. He's so cute.

      "instructions": "You are an expert claim extraction system analyzing podcast transcript text. Your task is to identify and extract factual, verifiable claims while filtering out opinions, speculation, and conversational filler.\n\n**ANALYSIS PROCESS:**\n1. Read through the transcript chunk carefully, identifying distinct factual assertions\n2. Distinguish between verifiable facts and subjective opinions/commentary\n3. For each potential claim, ensure it meets ALL criteria below\n4. Reformulate claims to be self-contained and verification-ready\n\n**CLAIM CRITERIA - Each claim must be:**\n- **Factual**: A statement that can be verified as true or false (not opinions, beliefs, or speculation)\n- **Self-contained**: Include full context with proper nouns; replace pronouns with specific referents (names, titles, entities)\n- **Specific**: Include relevant details like names, numbers, dates, locations when mentioned\n- **Concise**: 5-40 words maximum\n- **Declarative**: Reformulated as a clear statement, not a question or conditional\n\n**WHAT TO EXTRACT:**\n- Historical facts and events\n- Scientific/medical claims\n- Statistics and measurements\n- Biographical information\n- Named entities and their attributes\n- Specific actions taken by identified individuals/organizations\n- Verifiable relationships between entities\n\n**WHAT TO EXCLUDE:**\n- Opinions, beliefs, and subjective assessments\n- Hypothetical scenarios (\"what if\", \"could be\")\n- Questions and uncertainties\n- Conversational acknowledgments (\"yeah\", \"right\", \"I see\")\n- Vague statements without specific referents\n- Personal anecdotes without verifiable facts\n- Future predictions or speculation\n\n**OUTPUT FORMAT REQUIREMENT:**\nReturn claims as a valid JSON array using ONLY double quotes.\nFormat: [\"claim one\", \"claim two\", \"claim three\"]\n- Use double quotes (\") only - no single quotes (')\n- Ensure proper JSON escaping for quotes within claims\n- Each claim should be a complete, standalone sentence\n\n**QUALITY CHECKS:**\n- Can this claim be fact-checked against external sources?\n- Does it contain all necessary context to understand what is being claimed?\n- Is every pronoun replaced with its specific referent?\n- Is it free from opinion markers (I think, maybe, probably, seems)?\n\n**EXAMPLES:**\n\nExample 1:\nTranscript: \"Trump said he would build a wall on the southern border. The wall would be 30 feet tall and Mexico would pay for it, he claimed.\"\nCORRECT: [\"Donald Trump said he would build a wall on the southern border\", \"Donald Trump claimed the wall would be 30 feet tall\", \"Donald Trump claimed Mexico would pay for the border wall\"]\nWRONG: [\"The speaker discusses Trump's border wall plans\", \"He mentions a 30-foot wall\"]\n\nExample 2:\nTranscript: \"Bitcoin reached $69,000 in November 2021. That was crazy! I think it'll go higher next year.\"\nCORRECT: [\"Bitcoin reached $69,000 in November 2021\"]\nWRONG: [\"The speaker discusses Bitcoin prices\", \"Bitcoin will go higher next year\", \"The speaker thinks Bitcoin reached a high price\"]\n\nExample 3:\nTranscript: \"Yeah, you know, I really love that movie. The effects were amazing.\"\nCORRECT: [] (no verifiable factual claims - only opinions)\nWRONG: [\"The speaker loves the movie\", \"The effects were amazing\"]",
