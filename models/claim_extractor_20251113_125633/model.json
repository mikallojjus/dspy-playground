        "transcript_chunk": "piration to O'Connell would be an understatement. Not just how Edison succeeded, but how he talked about failure.\n\nI had heard that phrase, I have not failed 10,000 times. I have successfully found 10,000 ways not to build the light bulb. And of course, that led to the success.\n\nToday, O'Connell and his studio build public art projects across the country. Some of them are complicated pieces with big moving parts. He has won awards. His work is in museums. But O'Connell says the projects he remembers best are the ones that don't work out. His biggest failure was in Houston. It's a massive piece made of aluminum and stainless steel and fabric. It's called wings over water.\n\nWe won the commission in the spring of 2016, and it had to be installed in downtown Houston in time for Super Bowl 51, which was February, 2017. And it was going to be what's, by some measures, the world's largest freestanding outdoor kinetic sculpture in an active fountain. And it all had to be done in a few months. Houston is a city of immigration and migration. It's the number one city from which people coming from south and Central America get their first foothold in the United States. They have an economy that is welcoming.\n\nThey have established communities. It's also an extremely welcoming city to bird migration. Houston and the Gulf of Mexico. Houston interface is where birds on the Central American Flyway stop after they've flown over the Gulf. And so the concept for this art is to give tribute to when a bird or a human is in a difficult spot and doesn't have a place to land and rest, they just have to fly days and days without rest. So the idea was this giant set of wings that has this sine wave that moves through it along two axes, and the wings are continuously beating over the fountain wings, over water, if you will, in an effort to be completely, metaphorically true to Houston.\n\nIt is moved by a large hydraulic motor that turns a crankshaft. And the wings are supported by, I think it's 32 push rods that look like oil derricks rising and falling. So the things were installed, it ran for the Super Bowl. People love it. It's the backdrop for countless social media photos. And in the Super Bowl between plays, there's some footage of it. Then three things happened. We had Hurricane Harvey, which hit Houston, but didn't damage the sculpture. It was a pretty mild impact on the actual downtown we had planned for hurricanes.\n\nIt also went through Covid during a period of time when we know that the plaza was not policed, and we'd heard that kids were kind of getting in the fountain and messing around. In any event, COVID iss over we're reopening to the public and the sculpture's operating. What got us was we were not prepared for the big Texas freeze for one to two weeks. The temperature was around 10 20 degrees, and pipes froze and broke all over Houston. So the main helix that drives wings over water is itself a pipe. And as it dips in and out of the fountain, it accumulates water.\n\nAnd we had never anticip. We had gotten environmental data and we had anticipated an ice storm coating the sculpture, and we did the calculations for that. But nothing in our assumptions led us to calculate two weeks of how much water expands when it gets down well below 20 degrees. So it went through the ice storm and there was no visible damage. And then cracks started to develop in one part of the helix. So the first thing we do is we immobilize it, we replace that part with an identical part, and then right next to it, additional cracks developed.\n\nSo we stopped operating. And again, and what they decided to do as of last November was to say, you know, I think we're just gonna leave the sculpture off as a static sculpture, And that's the current position. And so we took that, well, it's theirs. You know, we took that judgment a little harshly. It's the feeling you get when you've prepared for problems A, B, C, D, E, and F, and something like G or M comes out of the blue and smacks you. We had spent so much time worrying about what would happen if there was a hurricane. You know, what if somebody got hurt building it?\n\nNobody ever got hurt building it. And the sculpture eventually made it through Hurricane Harvey. But I think this particular incident highlights one of the problems with projects and complexity. It would probably take a million dollars to totally redo the bottom part of wings over water. And I still hold out the thought that that would be a wonderful future. Second act for wings over water if just a relatively small amount of money by municipal standards could be raised. I will tell you one thing about Edison. He wasn't driven by money. He was passionate about inventing the next thing. He was driven by the beauty of the things he was making.\n\nAnd I feel like I have that too. And that sets you up for disappointment, for failure. 'cause you can't stop investing in what you're doing.\n\nThere's one more zone of failure that we haven't heard about today. It's love.\n\nNobody gets outta love alive, nobody. We all know that. But we go on.\n\nHelen Fisher was a friend of mine, a lovely human. She died last year. She was an anthropologist who studied romantic love.\n\nI have been extremely lucky during most of my life. I've lived with men long-term, two men, long-term, one for 15 years, another for 18 years. Oddly enough, I've studied marriage for 50 years, but I wasn't interested in marrying. I finally met the man of my dreams. I just nuts about him. He is a very well known journalist, and he had interviewed me for years and, and I really liked him. And we went. We went out for about six months, and then he dumped me. Yeah, he dumped me when I was 70. I was never angry at him. The reason I wasn't angry at him is he was a single father going through a horrible divorce.\n\nHe just came to me one day and he said, Helen, I just can't take on anymore. I remember he did it in Grand Central Station, and I was standing there and I said, okay. And I remember I walked home and I just sat at the edge of my bed for six weeks playing music to kill yourself by and crying. I mean, what else do you do? And you know, overloading my friends with my sorrow and all that, which by the way, after a while isn't a good idea. You're just raising the ghost. But anyway, what I did though is I never contacted him. I never wrote him at Christmas to wish him well. I never contacted him again.\n\nI think it allowed him to realize that he was a free agent, that he could start this relationship and explore where it was gonna go without having a tightrope around his neck. So he wrote to me a letter and said to me that he thought he'd made a terrible mistake and we fell in love and we got, I got married to him at age 75. When he asked me to marry him. I said, I'll marry you, but I'm not moving in because I have a little nice apartment in New York. He's got a beautiful apartment in the Bronx. But I mean, I'm there five nights a week. The other nights I like to go to the theater with my girlfriends, et cetera.\n\nIf Helen Fisher is to be believed, the difference between success and failure is sometimes just timing. Time, after all is the dimension of change. It isn't hard to think of success and failure as nearly identical as twins, even separated by nothing but a few moments. This is what Travis Thul came to believe, fo you will remember, is the inventor of the ramen. Now,\n\nThe feedback we received consistently was, this is great. This is awesome. We'll sell millions. We just need you to pony up two or $300,000 up front.\n\nAfter he spoke with us about his failed invention, he started thinking maybe he shouldn't have given up. He still doesn't have the two or $300,000, but he did think of a way to raise it with a campaign on Kickstarter, the crowdfunding platform. So we got back on the line with Travis doll.\n\nYeah, so the proposal to give this one last rodeo on Kickstarter seemed really intuitive. I hired a marketing team. I hired a graphic designer, hired a mechanical engineer, a couple other folks that have helped put together the social media presence, build the webpage, build out some more three-dimensional renders. Of course, we've done the prototyping and the experimentation. So really, I think putting ourselves in a position where if Kickstarter has the interest that we hope it will, we might be able to get a good product to some early adopters in the not too distant future.\n\nWhat do you think your chance of success is?\n\nThis whole conversation started out of failing gloriously, right? There was a point 10 years ago where I thought, how on earth could this fail? This is such a simple concept with a huge audience, right? This is literally the coffee maker for ramen noodles, which everybody eats. And of course, we were not successful the first rodeo, so I, I want temporary expectations. I would be happy to be surprised.\n\nWould you put your odds at maybe 50 50 at least, or no?\n\nOh my, maybe there's a 10% chance that we raised that $300,000. I think that's probably just being an engineer. I think that's the more statistically relevant reality. But I think, you know, maybe the Hope Springs eternal and all of us failed and successful entrepreneurs that, you know, we get that visibility and there's somebody out there and says, you know what? This has a potential George Foreman grill style market. Why don't we give this a go? Given that the investment is relatively small, given the market size.\n\nIf there was a celebrity to link to the Ramen now, who would it be?\n\nOh, man. So I'm out of touch with pop culture like I was. Who can we get the kid that played Chunk from the Goonies? I feel like that would be a great voice for my generation. Aaron Rogers. He's very popular, I guess in New York, which would be a great place to go. Tom Brady, he's still around. Presumably we could go with him.\n\nWhat if you go upstream a little bit like Barack Obama might be interested and he's not that busy.\n\nYeah. Barack Obama did a very good episode with Anthony Bourdain, where they were eating noodles in Vietnam. Barack Obama eating Ramen outta my ramen maker would be, I guess I could call it a day at that point. I think the Obama now could be a potential kitchen appliance.\n\nSo the last time we spoke, you said, here's a quote from you, Travis. There's nothing more that I would like to see in my lifetime than the successful launching and widespread adoption of ramen. Now, I was looking back over that transcript and I was thinking like, really, there's nothing more you'd like to see? You have a family and there's cancer and climate change. How do all those challenges, let's say, compare to the problem of instant ramen?\n\nWell, you know, if you can't enjoy your ramen the way you want to when you want to, what's the point of it all? What else is there?\n\nWell played, sir. Well played\n\nWorld peace is very important, but I wanna assure that when we have that peaceful world, everybody in it can eat ramen. Now,\n\nI hope you enjoyed this episode and we've got an update for you on Travis th and the Ramen. Now, his Kickstarter campaign raised only $54,000, a long way from his goal of $277,000. That might sound like another failure, but the story did not end there. After this episode aired in 20 23, 2 listeners reached out to Thul to learn more about Ramen. Now, they were both entrepreneurs who liked the idea and wanted to help him get it off the ground, and that's how Ramen now finally found its lead investor, MOA Hila, the CEO of a Denver contracting company. Thul says he hopes we will see the Ramen now on store shelves by next spring.\n\nComing up next time on the show, the fourth and final episode in our series, How to Succeed at Failing. Here's a question. If there's so much to learn from failure, why is no one teaching it? I'm\n\nGonna do this experimental class and I'm gonna call it Failure one oh one,\n\nAnd how would you feel about a Museum of Failure?\n\nWe have Pepsi, crystal New Coke. We have the Thoran Blood Testing Kit.\n\nAlso, you've heard of a post-mortem when things go wrong. How about a pre-mortem? That's next time on the show.

He graduated summa cum laude and he was the student speaker at his own graduation. He started work on his PhD at the University of Chicago's Committee on Social thought, but he returned to Rutgers to finish it. His thesis was called The Odyssey of Political Theory, which he turned into his first book. It examined how Homer's Odyssey spoke to issues like departure and return, and whether our contemporary culture wars are driven by reality or just what some people might call mood affiliation. His thesis advisor was Wilson Carey McWilliams, a well-regarded political scientist.\n\nWilson Ker McWilliams was a great and ardent New Deal Democrat. He was a profound influence in my life.\n\nMcWilliams was perhaps best known for studying morality in politics, and you can hear Mc Williams's voice in some of Patrick Deen's writing. Deen's journey through academia has been a bit of an odyssey itself. His first teaching job was at Princeton\n\nAs an assistant professor. We were assigned a large number of senior thesis to advise 15 to 20. Each of these were about a hundred pages in many cases. They weren't students you'd worked with before or had classes with you.\n\nThat was a case with a Princeton undergraduate named Pete Hegseth, who today is the Secretary of Defense.\n\nSo I didn't know him when he stepped into my office, other than the fact that I was a pretty ferocious Princeton basketball fan. I took our young sons to a lot of those games. It was a great team to watch because it was that old Pete Carll, his system, the Princeton system, great offense to watch. Really, really fun. This\n\nWas a system that went back to Bill Bradley, wasn't it? Oh\n\nYeah. And it was designed for a team that was maybe not as athletically talented as some of the other teams. No shade on Bill Bradley, but it worked because it really created a team that could overcome even other teams with great superstar college.\n\nI'm sensing a parable here. I'm sensing that you saw something in that Princeton basketball team that you like for society.\n\nMy father would tell us that we should watch Princeton basketball whenever possible. My father is a basketball coach, but at any rate, I knew Pete from the basketball team. He was a bench player. He was a good player. But those starters were really, was really a tight great group. He would come off the bench and knock down a couple threes and suddenly the game would tight. So I really admired Pete for that. I knew that he was in ROTC, and this was after 2001. Any Princeton student who was in the army was amazing to me before 2001. But any Princeton student who was in the military after 2001 was just a miraculous human.\n\nI mean, this is a university that was producing scads and scads of finance bankers and people who are gonna go on very, very lucrative careers, right?\n\nThe elites that your books have described with some disdain. Disdain may be a bit strong,\n\nMight be strong, but deep worry about the way in which they're impacting our country. When Pete came in to speak with me, we would talk about what it was to be someone in the military at Princeton as a student who intended to serve on the ground. So I had a lot of respect for Pete as a student. I still have a lot of respect for Pete based on that experience. And then after he finishes the thesis, he goes out serves. I kind of followed him a bit. He published things, and then the next time I see him pop up, he's on Fox News. And I was like, wow, there's Pete\n\nHeg. Seth's thesis was called Modern Presidential Rhetoric and the Cold War Context, a recent investigation by the Daily Princetonian newspaper found eight instances of uncredited material, sham, paraphrasing, and verbatim copying. In Heg Seth's thesis, a Pentagon spokesperson said there was no plagiarism and that the accusations were political. Whatever the case, Patrick Deneen taught for several years at Princeton, but wasn't offered tenure. And he moved on to Georgetown where he did get tenure. And at Georgetown he founded the Tocqueville Forum on the roots of American democracy. After several years at Georgetown, he moved to Notre Dame. In 2012, he felt that Notre Dame was, as he puts it, engaged in a more robustly Catholic form of higher education.\n\nAnd he wanted to raise his kids in a smaller town. His breakout book, why Liberalism Failed, was published in 20 18, 2 years into Donald Trump's first term.\n\nIt was not a response to what was happening electorally. It wasn't unc cognizant of what was happening electorally, but the content of that book. You finished writing\n\nThe book, if I recall correctly, just before Trump was elected, correct?\n\nYeah, it was around the time of the election. But that said, every chapter in that book had been in some way, shape, or form drafted in the previous decade, if not the previous 20 years. And so it wasn't a response to an immediate political situation. And of course it got picked up because the title certainly, but also I think the content, it captured a moment. It was for especially an intellectual class that had been blindsided and didn't know what was happening. And then this professor writes this book that seems at some level to answer that question. The day that it appeared, it was a Tuesday in January of 2018, David Brooks devoted his column to a discussion of the book, followed by a number of different columns in the New York Times, Washington Post.\n\nIt kind of just took off and became a very surprising bestseller, especially to me. But that book was really everything we've been talking about, long readings of Tocqueville and the Federalist Papers and Aristotle and Rousseau and Montesquieu, and distilling them as they touch our contemporary lives today. And then of course, I'm invited to countless interviews and then the book, it's translated, and that shocked me into 25 languages. Now, the entire time I'm sort of assuming, okay, this is all kind of scholarly and intellectual, but before I know it, it's getting picked up and discussed by various political figures among them. Of course, most famously today, JD Vance, who was not yet a senator, but had read it, and he began reaching out to me to talk about some of its ideas, and I was thrilled to do so.\n\nHe was interested in part because he was considering converting to Catholicism at the time time. That's\n\nRight. And we've talked quite a bit about his being drawn to Catholicism, Catholic social teaching, we\n\nShould say. He did convert, ultimately. I didn't wanna leave that hanging.\n\nHe did. He did enter the church. Then the journalists start sniffing this out and they think, oh, here's the puppet master. It's an absurd claim, but there's always this desire to say, who's the power or who's the brain behind? I mean, j D's got his own mind\n\nAnd he's, well, what's it been like for you to get brought into these political circles and debates, whether directly or indirectly?\n\nIt's a thing of ambivalence and confusion for me, because I think of myself first and foremost as someone who's just trying to parse through ideas, think through the nature of politics and how does that reflect on our contemporary moment?\n\nAnd that's satisfying for you. That's satisfying enough.\n\nThat's always been satisfying enough. On the other hand, I've always felt that part of my calling as a faculty member, as a scholar, is to, when asked to try to offer as best I can, an explanation for the views as I've been able to come to them, the conclusions I've been able to reach to be engaged in conversations and debates, it's a different thing when that gets caught up into politics. Now it's related to power. What's the utility?\n\nThere's one team versus the other. Right?\n\nOn the one hand, it's gratifying to have the interest of political figures from around the world who want to talk about ideas. Victor\n\nOrban, for instance.\n\nYeah. I mean, why wouldn't one want to talk to a prime minister of a major European country about one's ideas? But it turns out that's tantamount to academic heresy.\n\nSay a little bit more about that. Have you been penalized within the community for becoming a political figure or a politically associated figure?\n\nThere's absolutely no doubt.\n\nSo what happens when you walk down a sidewalk on Notre Dame campus? Now\n\nThey all cross the street. Now, I would say that any trajectory of my academic career has been more or less arrested in terms of academic status and accolades.\n\nWhat more are you looking for though, your tenured professor, I assume at Notre Dame?\n\nOf course. Of course. Well, there comes a point in your life where you've maybe reached a certain level of understanding and you've developed a academic worldview and people want to hear from it. Then you begin to get invited to give lectures, maybe some of the big lectures at the big universities. It's the kind of thing where as you reach the end of your career to make the circuit and that is not forthcoming.\n\nIt sounds as if you feel well, disappointed for sure, but maybe a bit aggrieved that your work is being misread because of people who are reading it and putting it to political purpose. Is that right?\n\nIt's an interesting consequence that on the one hand, the person in charge of Notre Dame's communications office was absolutely thrilled that I'm being interviewed by you and will appear on Freakonomics. Of course, universities always want to crow about the successes and the public prominence of their faculty at the same time, if that prominence is because it's in some ways now associated with a political set of figures and positions that\n\nThe Trump administration, let's just say, right?\n\nYes. And populism, that within academia is regarded as tantamount to fascism. It turns out that having now achieved one thing that universities appreciate and often crow about in terms of their faculty, it turns out it has the opposite effect. If I had just been working in the coal mines of academia and never appeared above the surface, that would've been perfectly fine. But it's the nature of the prominence now. So it's puzzling to me on the one hand. Okay, so I've written these things. It turns out they've gotten a lot of play, not necessarily with the direct intention of influencing this, that, or the other figure, and as a result, academically it's red redo negatively.\n\nDo you feel like persona non grata on campus at Notre Dame?\n\nThat's a good question. No, I don't feel like persona non grata, but I feel I, I, I don't think I could answer this. Sorry, Steve.\n\nWell, let me go back. You mentioned the comms department. Has anyone from Notre Dame tried to dissuade you from doing interviews, including this one? No,\n\nNot at all.\n\nDo you have to get clearance? No. If you did, it might not be forthcoming. It sounds like you're saying No.\n\nI would say, leaving aside the question of Notre Dame, one of the consequences of feeling this obligation when asked by journalists or by podcasters and so forth, when asked to talk about my worldview and arguments I've made, what I began to discover having agreed to most of these requests over the past several years, especially as we approached election seasons and 2020 and then 2024, these were not honest brokers. These would often be very prominent journalists that, you know, some pretty major news outlets.\n\nYou and I discussed one of these in private. Yes. Which we don't need to repeat, but the institution may rhyme with smoosh smirk SCHs. Yes,\n\nThat's one of them. But there are many,\n\nWhen you say they're not honest brokers though, Patrick, if you could explain that, I think it wouldd be really appreciated by people who listen because you know, I personally love journalism. I think journalism is a phenomenally valuable institution within a civic society. I\n\nAgree. I agree.\n\nWhen done well, like any institution, when done well, when\n\nDone well,\n\nPrint journalists like myself, we always used to make fun of tv. They'd say they call it a medium because it's neither rare nor well done. And we clung to our belief that, you know, old fashioned reporting, interviewing people, getting out the truth, et cetera, et cetera, was an incredibly valuable thing if done well. And so when I hear from someone like you who's been interviewed by people, whether they're presenting themselves as legitimate mainstream journalists or not, as you know, not honest brokers, it pains me because it hurts everyone and it hurts me, hurts what I do, but it hurts society, I think. So if you could give an example, I'm not asking you to name names. If you're dying to name a name, go for it.\n\nBut how this would work, what that conversation would be presented to you as, and what the actual conversation would be, and then what the publication of it would be?\n\nTypically, it would be some form of email, a phone call from a journalist saying, I'm writing this story on such and such leading up to the election, or about this political figure or that. And we'd really like to understand from you who seem to have written in this area as an academic and something of a, I guess, public intellectual. I would generally agree to be interviewed. We would set up a time, we'd do a zoom or we'd be a phone interview. Sometimes I would ask to do written responses, and it wasn't in terms of what I had to say or even the hostility of the questions. That's part of the game. It was how it would be framed, how the article would be written.\n\nAnd then the way in which the quotes would appear from me, it would say, you know, reflecting this tendency toward fascism, comm up, denine, something like that. Really trying to frame everything in the most negative light. Journalism, as we all know, reflects a particular progressive worldview today. Many of the journalists working today believe that it's not enough just to report as objectively and as clearly as possible in this case, what the responses of this particular person where they have to frame it in such a way that, you know what I think, and I'm gonna make sure that you know what should be thought.\n\nWhere do you think that instinct comes from? And I would just caveat that by saying that you're attributing that to the individual journalist, but I think often that's driven by the institution itself.\n\nWell, sure, they're being hired by these places.",

        "transcript_chunk": "ugh Shopify and that runs on Ruby on Rails. So Ruby on Rails is able to scale up to that level without using static typing in all of what it does. Now I know they've done certain experiments in certain ways because they are hitting some of the limits that you will hit with Dynamic typing and some of those limits you hit with Dynamic typing are actually, by the way, just limits you hit when you write 5 million lines of code.\n\nI think the Shopify monolith is about 5 million lines of code at that scale. Everything breaks because you're at the frontier of what humans are capable of doing with programming languages. The difference in part is that Ruby is such a succinct language that those 5 million, if they had been written in, let's just say Go or Java would've been 50 or 25 now, that might have alleviated some of the problems that you have when you work on huge systems with many programmers. But it certainly would also have compounded them trying to understand 25 million lines of code.\n\nSo the thing does scale. That's a persistent myth that it doesn't scale Shopify and and others. But Shopify think's a great example. By the way, I love Shopify and I love Toby. Amazing.\n\nYou gotta have Toby on. Yeah, for sure. Just talking to him this\n\nMorning for sure. He is a brilliant I I got to hang out with him in the desert somewhere, I forget in Utah. He's just a brilliant human and and and\n\nShopify (82m 12s):\nShopify, Shopify dot com slash Lex has been supporting this podcast for the longest time. I don't, I don't think actually Toby knows that they sponsor this podcast. I mean it's a big company, right? It's a huge company. I think just under 10,000 employees market cap of 120 billion GMV of a quarter of a trillion every quarter. And He's involved with the details though He is very much so. Funny story about Toby. Toby was on the Rails core team back in the mid two thousands. Toby himself wrote Active Merchant, which is one of the frameworks for creating shops. He wrote the liquid templating language that Shopify still uses to this day. He has a huge list of contributions to the Rails ecosystem and he's the CEO of the company. Yeah, I think it's just, it's very inspiring to me because it's such at the opposite end of what I like to do, I like to chisel code with my own hands most of the day. He runs a company of almost 10,000 people that is literally like world commerce, depends on it. A level of criticality I can't even begin to understand. And yet we can see eye to eye on so many of these fundamental questions in computer science and program development. That is a dynamic range to be able to encompass Rails being a great tool for the one developer who's just starting out with an idea who don't even fully know everything, who is right at the level where PHP would've been a good fit in those late nineties because yeah, I could probably upload something to an FTP server and so on. Rails does have more complexity than that, but it also has so much longer runway. The runway goes all the way to goddamn Shopify. That is about the most convincing argument I can make for sort of dynamic range that we can do a lot of it. And even having said that, Shopify is the outlier. Of course. I don't think about Shopify as the primary target when I write Rails. I think of the single developer, actually I do think about Shopify, but I don't think about Shopify now. I think of Shopify when Toby was writing Snow Devil, which was the first e-commerce store to sell snowboards that he created, that was the pre Shopify. Shopify he created all by himself. And that was possible because Ruby on Rails isn't just about Beautiful code, it's just as much about Productivity. It's just as much about the impact that an individual programmer is able to have that they can build system where they can keep the whole thing in their head and be able to move it forward such that you can go from one developer sitting and working on something and that something is Shopify and it turns into what it is today. When we talk about programming languages and we compare 'em, we often compare 'em at a very late stage. Like what is the better programming language for let's say Twitter in 2009 when it's already a huge success. Twitter was started on Ruby and Rails. They then hit some Scaling problems. It was a big debacle at the time. They end up then I think writing it in some other language, which by the way I think is the best advertisement ever for Ruby on Rails because nothing fucking happened for 10 years after they switched over, right? Essentially zero innovation. Some of that was because they were doing a long conversion and all of the early success in part came because they had the agility to quickly change and adopt and so forth. That's what startups needs. That's what Shopify needed. That's what Twitter needed. That's what everyone needs and that's the number one priority for Ruby on Rails to make sure that we don't lose that. Because what happens so often when development tools and program language driven by huge companies is that they mirror their org chart react and everything else needed to use. That is in some ways a reflection of how meta builts Facebook because of course it's because of course it's the destruction of that. I'm not saying React isn't a great tool and that can't be used by smaller teams. Of course it can, but it's born in a very different context than something like Ruby on Rails. Lemme say this a small aside because I think we might return to Shopify that celebrated often. Just a sort of personal note, this particular podcast has way more Sponsors and Sponsors that want to be Sponsors than I could possibly ever have. And it's really, really important for me to not give a shit and to be able to celebrate people. Like I celebrate people, I celebrate companies and it has, I don't care that they're sponsoring. I really don't care. I just wanna make that very explicit 'cause we're gonna continue saying positive things about Shopify. I don't care. Stop sponsoring. It doesn't really matter to me. But yeah, I just wanna make that explicit.\n\nSo, but to linger on the Scaling thing with the Twitter and the Shopify, can you just explain to me what Shopify is doing with the, with the Jet? What did they have to try to do to scale this thing? Because that's kind of an incredible story, right?\n\nYeah. So one of the great contributions that Shopify has made to the entire Ruby ecosystem, not just Rails but in particular Rails is Wiji. So Wiji is their compiler for, for Ruby. That just makes everything a lot more efficient and at Shopify scale eeking out even a five 10% improvement in Ruby's overhead and execution time is a huge deal. Now, Shopify didn't need Wget. Shopify was already running on the initial version of Ruby. That was, I think 10 times slower than what we have today. If you look back upon the Ruby 1 8 6, that Topi probably started on just as I started on and that was enough to propel Shopify to the scale that it has today.\n\nA lot of the Scaling conversation in is lost in a failure to distinguish two things. Scale is kind of one package we talk about when there are really multiple packages inside of it. One is runtime performance latency. How fast can you execute a single request? Can it happen fast enough that the user will not notice If your rails request takes a second and a half to execute, the user's gonna notice your app is gonna feel slow and sluggish. You have to get that response time down below, let's say at least 300 milliseconds. I like to target a hundred milliseconds as my latency. That's kind of performance.\n\nHow much performance of that kind of latency can you squeeze out of a single CPU core that tells you something about what the price of a single request will be. But then whether you can deal with 1 million requests a second like Shopify doing right now, if you do a thousand requests a second, you just need X boxes to get up to a million. And what you'll actually find is that when it comes to programming languages, they're all the same in this way. They all scale largely beautifully horizontally. You just add more boxes. The hard parts of Scaling a Shopify is typically not the program language, it's the database.\n\nAnd that's actually one of the challenges that Shopify has now is how do you deal with MySQL at the scale that they're operating at? When do you need to move to other databases to get worldwide performance? All of these things, the questions about Scaling Ruby are economic questions. If we're spending so and so much on application servers, if we can get just 5% more performance out of Ruby, well we could save 5% of those servers and that could filter down into the budget. Now that analysis concludes into basically one thing. Ruby is a luxury language. It's a luxury, the highest luxury in my opinion.\n\nIt is the Coco Chanel of programming languages. Something that not everyone can afford. And I mean this in the best possible way. There are some applications on the internet where each request has so little value. You can't afford to use a luxurious language like Ruby to program in it. You simply have tolum it with a C or a go or some other low level language or a rust talk about line noise there for hot sake. That's like the thrift store of languages. Exactly where you need kind of just, you need a very low level to do it. You can't afford to use a luxury language to use to, to build it with. That's not true of Shopify. It wasn't true of Basecamp even back in 2004.\n\nIt's not been true of 99% of all web applications ever created because the main cost component of 99% of web applications is not CPU course. It's wet course, it's human course, it's human capacity to understand and involve systems. It's their personal Productivity. I did a calculation once when someone had for the 400th time set that, oh, if you switch from Ruby to some faster language, you could save a bunch of money. And I calculated it out that at the time, and I think the last time I did this calculation was almost a decade ago, we were spending about 15% of our operating budget on Ruby application service.\n\nSo for me to improve my cost profile of the business by seven percentage points, I'd have to pick something twice as fast. That's quite hard. Versus if Ruby and Ruby on Rails was even 10% more productive than something else, I would move the needle far more because making individual programmers more productive actually matters a lot more. This is why people are so excited about ai. This is why they're freaking out over the fact that a single programmer in Silicon Valley who makes $300,000 a year can now do the work of three or five, at least in theory. I haven't actually seen that fully in practice, but let's just assume the theory is correct if not now, than in six months.\n\nThat's a huge deal. That matters so much more than whether you can squeeze a few more cycles out of the CPU when it comes to these kinds of business applications. If you're making unreal engine rendering stuff like Tim Sweeney you had on, yeah, he needs to really sweat all those details. The Nan Night engine can't run on Ruby. It's never going to, it was not meant for that fine. These kinds of business applications absolutely can, and everything that people are excited about AI for right now, that extra capacity to just do more. That was why we were excited about Ruby back in the early two thousands. That was be because I saw that if we could even squeeze out a 10% improvement of the human programmer, we'd be able to do so much more for so much less.\n\nProbably argue about this, but I really like working together with ai, collaborating with ai and I would argue that the kind of code you want AI to generate is human readable, human interpretable. Yes. If it's generating Pearl golf code, it's just, it's not a collaboration. So it has to be speaking the human. It's not just you're writing the prompts in English. You also want to read the responses in the human interpretable language like Ruby. Right? So it's, that's actually is beneficial for AI too. 'cause you've kind of said that for you the sculptor, the sort of the elitist Coco Chanel sculptor, you want to on your fancy keyboard to type every single letter yourself of your own fingers.\n\nBut it's also that the benefit of Ruby also applies in once some of that is written by AI and you're actually doing with your own fingers. The editing.\n\nYes.\n\nBecause you can in interact with it because it's human interpretable.\n\nThe paradigm I really love with this was something Elon actually said on one of your shows when you guys were talking about neural link, that Neuralink allows the bandwidth between you and the machine to increase that language, either spoken or written is very low bandwidth. If you are to calculate just how many bits we can exchange as we are sitting here, it's very slow. Ruby has a much higher bandwidth of communication revealed conveys so much more concept per character than most other programming language do. So when you are collaborating with ai, you want really high bandwidth.\n\nYou want it to be able to produce programs with you, whether you're letting it write the code or not, that both of you can actually understand really quickly and a grand com or a grand concept, a grand system into far fewer parts that both of you can understand. Now, I actually love collaborating with AI too. I love chiseling my code and the way I use AI is in a separate window. I don't let it drive my code. I've tried that. I've tried the cursors and the wind surfaces and I don't enjoy that way of writing. And one of the reasons I do enjoy that way of writing is I can literally feel competence draining out of my fingers.\n\nLike that level of immediacy with the material disappears. And the where I felt this the most was I did this remix of Ubuntu called Amma Cube when I switched to Linux and it's all written in Bash. I'd never written nice, any serious amount of code in Bash before. Yeah. So I was using AI to collaborate, to write a bunch of bash with me because I needed all this. I knew what I wanted. I could express it in Ruby. But I thought it was an interesting challenge to filter through Bash because what I was doing was setting up a Linux machine. That's basically what Bash was designed for. It's a great constraint. But what I found myself doing was asking AI for the same way of expressing a conditional, for example, in Bash over and over again that by not typing it, I wasn't learning it, I was using it, I was getting the expression I wanted, but I wasn't learning it.\n\nAnd I got a little scared. I got a little scared like, is this the end of learning? Am I no longer learning if I'm not typing? And the way I, for me recast that was, I don't wanna give up on the ai. It's such a better experience as a programmer to look up APIs, to get a second opinion on something, to do a draft. But I have to do the typing myself because you learn with your fingers, if you're learning how to play the guitar, you can watch as many YouTube wi videos as you want. You're not gonna learn the guitar. You have to put your fingers on the strings to actually learn the motions. And I think there is a parallel here to programming where programming has to be learned in part by the actual typing.\n\nI'm just really, this is, this is fascinating. Listen, part of my brain agrees with you. A hundred percent part doesn't, I think AI should be in the loop of learning. Now current systems don't do that, but I think it's very possible for cursor to say, to basically force you to type certain things. So like if you set the mode of learning, I just, I don't want to be this sort of give up on ai. I really, I think, I think Vibe coding is a skill. So for an experienced programmer's too easy to dismiss Vibe coding as a thing.\n\nI\n\nAgree, I wouldn't dismiss it.\n\nBut I think you need to start building that skill and start to figure out how do you prevent the competency from slipping away from your fingers and brain.",
