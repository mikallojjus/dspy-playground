        "transcript_chunk": "ist always used to say, there's, there's plenty of room at the bottom. There's much more room at the bottom. In other words, as an intelligent species, an intelligent civilization progresses, they're not likely to kind of become space fairing as such, you know, and kind of exploring the cosmos. They're much more likely to go deep down and kind of instant instantiate themselves at the lowest levels of reality. That's where all the space is. It's not out there, surprisingly, all the space is downwards. Now, once an intelligence achieves that, and you have to imagine that probably there are probably billions of these civilizations that had had already achieved this before we even popped into existence, before we, you know, evolved as a species, they would effectively disappear. They would, they would become effectively part of the fabric of, of space time itself exploiting the fundamental computational structure of the lowest level of, of reality, basically. And that's where they reside. And there are probably far, far more, probably millions or billions more of those types of civilizations than there are ones, like I say, you and me, like us as humans, right? And so then you ask, well, if that's the case, you know, if we are interested in contacting, so quote unquote extraterrestrials, why are we focused on this tiny subpopulation of beings that are likely to be, you know, floating around in metallic discs or whatever. We should in fact be focusing on the, the much more abundant ones that are perhaps at the deepest levels of reality. And how would we do that? How would an intelligence that has completely transcended its biology and even completely transcended its physical form entirely? How would such an intelligence communicate with us? It would do it through our brain. That's the most obvious thing. Because the brain is how we interact with the environment. It's how we interact. It's the interface by which we interact with what there is. And I think DMT I'm not saying that these DMT entities are necessarily these post biological beings, but it's not out of the question. I'm not straying too far from fairly standard now modern scientific discourse. When I say that it's perfectly possible that there are very large numbers of these supremely intelligent civilizations that are everywhere and nowhere, and that we can somehow interact with using our brain. And that DMT generates this kind of highly susceptible, highly sensitive neurological state that allows us to interact with them. This is why perhaps when you go into the DMT space, it's immediately obvious, it's undeniable, undeniably apparent that you are interacting with some kind of supremely advanced intelligence. Could that be some intelligence that has existed long before we arrived on the sea? And that we are now kind of discovering this technology and I, I consider DMTT to be some kind of technology that we have discovered that we are now learning to use to interact with these intelligent agents that perhaps have been here for forever in human terms.\n\nThe, it's an interesting term, the term go there. Mm. You know, because that's what it feels like. Yeah. It feels like you're, you're traveling somewhere, like you're going somewhere. But the reality is that place that you're going is probably right here. Yes. That's where it gets weird because it's around you all the time. You just don't have the ability to tune into it all the time because you wouldn't be able to function if you did.\n\nExactly. And, and these beings, they probably don't even have a true form that you could represent visually. Right. Right. So when you see an insectoid alien or a machine now, you're probably not seeing, or almost certainly, I've\n\nNever seen a machine now. Oh, really? Have you?\n\nI've seen, I dunno if I've seen the, the archetypal kind of McKenna McKenna of McKenna\n\nMachine out. Yeah. The way you described it was very odd. But\n\nI've seen certainly a multitude of beings. Very, very kind of srey squeaky. Yeah. Like jabbering, jabbering.\n\nYou know, I saw once a bunch of jokers giving me the finger, ah, they were all giving me the finger, and they're going, fuck you. And they were jokers with like little tassels on with the bells in the end of it. Right. And it made me very aware that I was taking myself too seriously. And they were like, yep, yep. And they said it to me and they pointed their finger at me like that. I was like, you're right. Yeah.\n\nIt's interesting, actually, it reminded me of something. There's this weird effect that people who, who use DMTA lot, they get this, you know, they might use DMT regularly and, and, and one day they, they take a hit as they normally do with the same batch of DMT, and they get a joker or a jester, and it wags its finger and says, not today, you've\n\nDone too much.\n\nYep, exactly. I've heard that before. Yeah. And it shuts off. A guy wrote to me and says that he, he saw a jester, as he often does, and it fucking punched him in the face. And he felt it, he felt, and it knocked him back into this world. And so the, the effect was gone. Oh, wow. Instantaneously. Now that is not easy to explain because it, this is not tolerance. DMT first of all doesn't exhibit subjective tolerance, unlike the other psychedelics. It's kind of weird. You can inject someone with DMT every 30 minutes perpetually, and they will, the intensity of their experience will always be the same. Yeah. It's not a tolerance and tolerance anyway, is a gradual thing. It increases gradually over time. Right. So it's not an off switch. I was speaking to someone, we, we are probably gonna talk about DMTX later, which is kind of my thing. But she was undergoing DMTX, which is this infusion where they, they keep the brain level of DMT constant and she, that's\n\nA tease to the big buildup Yes. Of DMTX. There\n\nWe go. Yeah. And she was in the DMT space interacting, the infusion machine was running, pumping her brain with DMT at constant rate, keeping the DMT levels in her brain constant. And she's interacting with these entities. And then at some point after maybe, you know, 30 minutes or whatever, when the machine was still running, they said to her, or impressed upon her, they said, okay, we we're done, we're done today. And the visions stopped. Whoa. But the machine, the brain was still being pumped with DMT, and yet the visions stopped. So what that suggests to me is that they do, indeed, as I said before, they have control. They are directing the information into the brain. And people, you know, described things like downloads in Graham Hancock. Actually, in, in his book Supernatural, in his first DMT experience, he described this, this download of highly complex, entirely non-human information into his brain as if he locked in to some kind of advanced computational processor that was, that was beaming information into his, his brain. And many people described that as like a download and of, of, of, of complex mathematical structures and strains, geometries, entirely, entirely non-human stuff. As if there's kind of, not that they expect you to understand it, but as if to say, you know, we know a lot more about reality than you do. We know a lot and you don't know anything. And that's the message they're kind of trying to impress upon you by directing it. And they can control it. They can, they can shut it off if they so, so decide.\n\nHmm.

Whatever it is. Whatever it is. Yeah. This idea that we all evolve along a similar pathway is strange to me that the concept is we assume that intelligent life everywhere else evolves along similar pathways. And that most of them eventually become some sort of a biological digital hybrid, if not completely digital. And then most of them probably figure out how to harness the power of the star and the suns. But one of the, the weird thing about us is that not just that we are evolving and that we have evolved, but yet we have this, but that rather we have this insatiable desire for technological innovation. Technological innovation, and to make things better. We're constantly improving upon everything we make. We're making better versions of every computer, every phone, every year. Even though it's not really necessary for most people, you're always buying them. It, it's a very strange desire that we have that I think sinks hand in glove to materialism. Because materialism is also still so stupid for an intelligent life form that has a finite lifespan to not be aware that collecting things does you no good 'cause you're gonna die. Like, but yet you want to collect things more than anything. And you wanna show people the things you've collected. Well, what better way to facilitate innovation and growth than to have a built in instinct for purchasing better things all the time and possessing better things all the time, which will force people to work literally into the grave Yeah. In order to get these things done.\n\nYeah. I think it's, it's psychotic. Yeah,\n\nIt is. But that, that's just us. Yeah. Like, it doesn't have to be like that. If you think about the hundreds of billions of stars just in this galaxy, the hundreds of billions of galaxies in the known universe, the, the endless possibilities of when intelligent life emerged, if in fact it did emerge anywhere, we have no evidence it emerged anywhere else but here. Right. We're just guessing. Mm. We assume. But if we were right, like it could have taken infinite number of forms, it could have evolved completely non-physical. Yeah. Like intelligent life that's completely non-physical. That's not, it's not contained to a cellular structure and bones and organs that it's plasma based. That it's some sort of in, in intelligence that communicates with some sort of a universal language. We, we don't, we're just guessing that everything's a monkey. We're just guessing. Everything's a curious monkey that keeps making a better spaceship. Yeah. Yeah. But that mind it be true. Which by the way, I went to the SpaceX, Jamie and I both did How dope. Sick. Pretty dope. We went to see the SpaceX launch. We were How far do you think we were? Were we a half a mile? Quarter of a mile? What do you think\n\nI call it a mile. A mile and a\n\nHalf. Maybe two miles. Oh, you think a mile More than a mile. Yeah. Really? Okay. Could have been. So let's say we're a mile away. Let's just guess. Well, let's just throw it in perplexity. I guess I can look. Throw it in perplexity. Ask our sponsor Perplexity. How far is the distance between Star base and the SpaceX rocket\n\nBetween the star base\n\nAnd the SpaceX Launchpad? Yeah, launchpad,\n\nSpaceX and Texas. Just to be specific.\n\nYeah. Because there's one in Florida as well. So they have their own town down there. It's like a legit town. It's like a military town. Like they took over a place like a, a military installation. These little tiny houses, fucking security everywhere. There's so many cyber trucks. If you have a cyber truck, you're fucked. You can't Fair enough. You have no idea. You better remember your parking spot.\n\nBitch.\n\nEverybody has a goddamn cyber truck.\n\nI estimated at less than one\n\nMile. See Okay. Right here. Okay. Main interest star base of the actual launch pad infrastructure. Estimated less than one mile public viewing sites. Okay. There's public viewing sites. Yeah. But we were there, we were at Star base, we were in a, like a public viewing site. We were at the actual rocket factory. And when that thing takes off, you feel it in your chest, it's nuts. So it's roughly a mile away and you have to wear earplugs. It's a mile away. Yeah. And you gotta wear earplugs and you feel it in your chest. And Elon's son was like, I wanna go home.\n\nLike,\n\nThere was a video, there's a video that I put and you could hear 'em in the background. It's so funny because my wife was like, were the babies Okay. 'cause women that have children, like they, they, that's the immediately what they go to. Not. Wow. That rocket's really cool. It's like, oh, are the baby's okay? Because she could hear 'em going, I wanna go, I wanna go. He was like, I wanna get outta here. Because it's that freaky, the power of it is just so nuts you that you feel, and then you see it and you realize like, God, how many people have seen a rocket launch? Like how crazy this thing's going into space. And then I went upstairs and I got to sit in the command console, or whatever you would call it, the command center. And I get with me and Elon and all the engineers, and we get to watch it land in Australia 35 minutes later. So we watch\n\n35 minutes Yes.\n\nFrom, yes, from from Texas, from Texas to Australia. Wow. It's crazy. And we're watching all these cameras in real time that are all connected to starlink satellites. So there's dozens of cameras. So you're watching about two miles is what this is. Oh, two miles straight across. Okay. It seems so close. It seemed really close. Okay. Two, even crazier. So two miles away in you feel it in your chest. It's nuts. I mean, it's really nuts. It's the power that it has is so nuts. But it's so old school, right? Yeah. It's just,\n\nYou know, it feels old fashioned in a weird kind of way.\n\nIt's the most modern version of like a V eight muscle car.\n\nIt's crazy. Right. If you think like a hundred years ago, at the end of the beginning of the 20th century, how different we would be in a hundred years as, you know, as we are now, it's, it's unfathomable. When you compare The rest of human history, it's, it's, it's like an exponential thing. You know, we, we've gradually been developing and technologically improving. And then we hit some point in the last century where we reach this kind of technological computer informational age, and everything is accelerating Exactly like Terrence McKenna was saying. Yes. Things speed up Right. Very, very quickly. And it feels like we're on the cusp either of killing ourselves, which is one option. Right. Or undergoing some profound transformation as a species, whether it be, whether it means becoming a spacefaring nation, sorry, a spacefaring civilization, or whether it means going in the opposite direction and becoming some kind of post biological civilization that exists beyond space and beyond time perhaps. And kind of joining the crowd of these intelligences that have made that transition perhaps billions of years ago.",

How the Devil is.\n\nI think it's the first time anyone's answered splendid when I ask him How you doing? So tell me about your book, man. Lemme see the cover of it. First of all,\n\nDeath by\n\nAstonishment. Death by Astonishment, which is the famous Terrence McKenna quote, right? Yes.\n\nHe was\n\nOff. The thing you have to Fear is Death by Astonishment. Exactly.\n\nYeah.\n\nYou know, the first time I did DMT, I literally heard his words Do not give into astonishment punishment. I literally heard those words. It's almost like whatever's over there. Yeah. Wanted me to hear that. Mm. So I could like sink in or whatever. 'cause I had already heard it before, you know, so they wanted to say it to me as well. It was very weird.\n\nYeah. It's sage advice, I think, because\n\nOh, it's the only way. No way. Because if you freak out, well, it's like, that's a good thing. It's good advice in most of life. Mm. Like, don't give in to the freak out. Yeah, yeah. Confronting the Mystery of the world's strangest drug. How did you get involved in this\n\nDMT? Yes.\n\nOh,\n\nSo you have to go back to my teenage years. Really? So, I mean, I first heard about DMT through Terrence McKenna, a friend again,\n\nLike most of us.\n\nYeah. Like most of us. But this was like, this was during like the dawn of the internet,\n\nRight. Long before you were a scientist. Long\n\nBefore I was a scientist. Right. So, a friend gave me this magazine and had this interview with this bearded, cheeky looking bearded fellow on the back called Terrence McKenna. And he spoke about this thing called DMT, which of course I didn't know what that was, but you know, the stories that he was telling that you were gonna meet these insectoid aliens and trans dimensional machine owls, jabbering in an indecipherable tongue and singing impossible objects into existence. I mean, it sounded ridiculous, but I was kind of, I was hooked. I thought, this is it. This is, this is the most fucking incredible thing I've ever read in my life. And say I was, I was like 15, 16 years old. And there, there was one computer in the school that was hooked up to the, the worldwide web. So all of like,\n\nWhat year was this?\n\n96.\n\nOh, early.\n\nI gave you my age away here, but\n\nEarly days of\n\nThe early days internet. Yeah. Yeah. So I spent all my time just, you know, going on to Alta Vista. Remember Alta Vista? I do.\n\nYeah. I didn't, I didn't remember it until you brought it up,\n\nRemember? Yeah. I was just kind of trying to find out as much as I could about this, and that was what triggered my decision to study chemistry and pharmacology. My kind of academic journey was, was triggered by, I want to know, you know, it's such a cool thing, the idea that you can, you can put a molecule in your brain and it, it doesn't just change how you feel, but it completely changes the entire structure of your reality. Your entire world is, is, is obliterated and replaced with one that is completely alien. That's a relationship whatsoever to that normal awaken world. That's incredible. And I kind of wanted to try at least to understand how that actually works.\n\nWell, the weirdest part about that molecules that your brain makes it. And so then you have to go, why? And what's the purpose of that? And what are we really, you know, what is, what is consciousness and what is, what is normal consciousness? What's the purpose of it? And why does this chemical exist? What does this molecule exist that's produced by the brain that changes everything and seems to transport you to a place that's more real than this physical reality that we find ourselves in right now.\n\nExactly. And that is kind of the great mystery. And I don't, I think most people who, even, even people who've kind of learned about DMT, even scientists, I mean, I, I speak to scientists. I, I engage with scientists, neuroscientists often, and they will say, oh, this is just hallucination. This is just your brain kind of making it up. And I don't think most scientists realize how confounding and how difficult to explain the DMT state is. I think it is one of, one of life's true mysteries. It is not simple to explain the DMT state.\n\nWell, I think it's almost irresponsible to try to explain it without experiencing it. It's not gonna kill you. Yeah. It's not gonna kill you. It lasts 15 minutes. Stop being a pussy. Right. Just do it and then tell me It's just hallucination. That's it. Yeah. Just do, do a big one. Three giant hits. Come back. Tell me, this is normal. Yeah. Tell me, this is just a freak out. 'cause it sure doesn't seem like it, does it?\n\nNo, and I mean, that was what I mean, I mean, I, I first learned about DMT as I said, when I was 15 or 16, but my first experience was probab well close to a decade later. And I thought before I took it, I thought I kind of knew what to expect. I mean, I'd listened to all the Terence McCann lectures I could find. I, I'd read all the books. I read all the trip reports, and I thought, okay, I'm kind of ready for this. I kind of know what's gonna happen. And I wasn't ready. And I was shocked. I was horrified in a sense. I was appalled. I mean, this was like, this is impossible. This was an impossible experience. I was confronted with an what seemed to me to be the, the undeniable hand of some kind of intelligence, and not just any kind of intelligence, but a supremely advanced, ancient and yet highly technological intelligence. And that was undeniable to me in those first few moments. Within sort of 30 seconds of that drug hitting my, my, my brain, I knew that this is, this is something else. And I was at first horrified. I was shocked. I just thought this, what is this? And then when I finally kind of came back, I was, I was, I remember lying on my bed, on my back, like shaking to my very bones. And all I could say was, oh my fucking God. Because I was completely confounded. You know? I mean, and by then I was a chemical pharmacologist. I was assigned it. I should, I should,\n\nYeah.\n\nI should know what's going on here. But I had no idea what was going on. And I thought, this is, this is it. This is what I need to get to grips with.\n\nIt also gives you a very, like an, an unusual understanding of the mechanisms that you interface with the world. Like, like ego and logic and reasoning and rational thinking. It gives you like this understanding that those are kind of just these weird tools that you use to get by. And you're left without them in there. It just, they, they evaporate and dissolve. And then when you come back, you're like, what am I doing? Yeah. The way I talk. Like, what, what is my, what's my purpose of interacting with people? Like what, how much of the way I talk to people. It's this weird social dance, weird ego, performative, sort of like the way I structure sentences, the way I communicate. It all seemed so clunky. When, when you come back and you just go, wow, we are a mess. Like collectively as a species, we're so without some sort of awakening or some, some kind of experience, some sort of a psychedelic profound breakthrough experience. Like you're so hampered by your physical existence and this sort of ancient tribal programming that we have that we're running through this maze of life with. And you come back and go, God, this is so weird.\n\nYeah. I think what DMT does is, is show you that everything, everything you thought you knew about how reality is structured and what's, what's real and what's not real, what is fantasy, what's possible, and what's not possible. Yeah. All of that is, is completely kind of extubated in an instant. And you realize, actually we don't, we don't have a fucking clue about the way things really are. I think DMT just demonstrates that, whether You understand it, whether we can, we can really understand what's going on in the brain and why, and how this experience is even possible. It just shows you how little we really understand about the, the nature of this\n\nEpisode is brought to you by the farmer's dog.

Yeah, I mean, I work mainly kind of, I guess you could say theoretically, in that I do more quantitative and qualitative analysis of the DMT state and try to understand, try to use the tools of neuroscience to try to understand how DMT elicits its its effects. So we can kind of get into, if you want Sure. If you wanna go really deep. Yeah, sure. I can give you a kind of a, a neuroscience lesson. Yeah. Please. Can talk about, so, so, you know, if you wanna understand DMT, we kind of have to start with the, the basic observation. You know, before you take DMT, you are experiencing a world, right? Whenever you're awake and conscious, you're experiencing a world, the normal waking world, this is the world that's kind of familiar to us. When you take DMT, that world is transformed. It disappears, it's obliterated, and it's replaced with one that is altogether stranger, shall we say. And so, so what I want to do is kind of understand, first of all how that happens, what's actually going on in the brain to cause that transition and why that happens. And you can't do that unless you have a, a decent understanding of the normal waking world. So what is the normal waking world? It's a model. It's an interface generated by your brain. So you have this world building machinery on the outerlay of your brain called the cortex. And this is generating your world all the time. All the features of the world that you're experiencing are represented within the cortex. And that applies whether you are just normal waking life. It applies in dreaming, it even applies in the psychedelic state. The world that you experience is, is always constructed as a model by the brain. And so what that means is that psychedelics, what they're doing is they're man, they're perturbing the brain. They're manipulating the brain and altering that model. Now, for example, with, let's say psilocybin from magic mushrooms, psilocybin binds to this receptor in the brain called the five HD two A receptor, which you're probably familiar with, the cy serotonin receptor. And so this is a, it's, it's called an excitatory receptor. It stimulates these neurons, which your cortex is constructed from, makes them more excitable, makes them more likely to fire and share information between two other neurons. You get this kind of loosening up of the, the world model that your brain is constructing. So the walls start to breathe, objects seem to kind of change their identity. Everything becomes more fluid and dynamic. And if you put someone into an MRI machine, for example, you can actually see that in the normal waking state. You can see the neural activity. It, it's, it's dynamic, but it's, it's kind of organized and well orchestrated. You give someone psilocybin, let's say, or LSD, and you start to see the activity becoming sort of more random and fluid. So you get this, this state of slightly increased disorder as if the, the, the, the kind of the tuning dial between order and disorder in the brain has been slightly nudged towards disorder. But then with DMT, something remarkable happens in the, the early stages of the experience. You get this kind of quite chaotic state suggesting that the rain is entering this more disordered state, but then it kind of collapses into this brand new order. So you go from the order of the normal waking world to this disordered state, and then you collapse into this completely different type of order. So the brain is effectively constructing an entirely different model of reality. It's no longer the normal waking world model, which acts as kind of an interface with the environment, but it's constructing a, a completely different world model.\n\nWhen you say constructing, why do you use that term? What, why do you use the brain is constructing\n\nBecause you are, well, okay, so, so if you think about, you know, how does the brain interact with the, how do we interact with the environment using our senses, right? So light information comes through the eyes, the retina, and it stimulates the, the very back of the brain. You have an area. Oh,\n\nOh, you brought slides.\n\nI brought slides. There we\n\nGo.\n\nYeah, maybe the next one, Jamie, is a bit easier to see. There we go. So at the right, the back of the brain here, you have an area called V one, which is the primary visual cortex. That's your interface with the world. Sensory information comes and strikes, it activates patterns of neural activity in V one. But it's very, very messy. It's like lines and patches of color and, you know, lines moving in certain directions. It's a mess, right? It's very noisy, it's very messy. It's incredibly dynamic. It doesn't make any sense. And so what your brain does is it has another level above V one that kind of has a bird's eye view and is looking for patterns within this neural activity in this lowest level. So it's looking, saying, oh, those lines kind of could be a triangle, or this could be a circle. It's trying to find patterns to try generate order from this messy level in V one. Can I\n\nAsk you this? How do we know it does that?\n\nThat's a good question. Well, there are a number of things. So the earliest evidence came from a, one of the earliest forms of evidence came from a guy called Wilder Penfield. Are you familiar with No. So Wilder Penfield, he was interested in treating epilepsy, and he invented something called the Montreal procedure where he would remove a part of the brain that was the focus of epileptiform activity. The idea being that it would kind of cure someone's epilepsy. But before he could do that, of course he needed to make sure that he wasn't removing, you know, important parts for someone's function. So what he would do is he would cut the top of their skull off when they're still awake. Yeah. And kind of expose their brain. And then he would zap different parts of their brain and say, you know, what's happening?",

I played in the Green Room, says people that are like, I don't want to hear AI music. I'm like, just listen to this. And they're like, God damnit. Yeah. It's fucking incredible. I mean, I think it's gonna only gonna get better from here. Yeah. Only gonna get better. And Ron White was telling me about this joke that he was working on, that he couldn't get to work. He's like, I got this joke I've been working on. He goes, I just threw it in a chat GPTI said, tell me what, what, what would be funny about this? And he goes, it listed like five different examples of different ways he can go. He's like, hold on a second, tighten it up. Make it, make it funnier. Make make it more like this. Make it more like that. And it did that like instantaneously. Yep. And, and, and then he was in the green room. He was like, holy shit, we're fucked. He's like, yeah, yeah, yeah. He goes, it wrote a better joke than me in 20 minutes. I've been working on that joke for a month.\n\nYeah. I mean, if, if you want to, if you want to have a good time or like make people really laugh at a party, you can use grok and you can say do a vulgar roast of someone. And Grok is gonna, it's gonna be an epic vulgar roast. You can even say like, take a picture of like, make a vulgar roast of this person based on their appearance of, of people at the party. So\n\nTake a photo of them. Yeah.\n\nJust literally point the camera at them and now do a vulgar roast to this person and, and, and, and, and then, but then keep saying no, no, make it even more vulgar. Use forbidden words even more v and just keep repeating even more vulgar eventually. It's like, holy fuck. You know, it's, it's, it's like, I mean, it's trying to jam a rocket up your ass. Like, and, and, and have it explode. And it's, and it's like, you, you're it's it's like, it's, it's like it's next level. It's,\n\nAnd it's gonna get better beyond\n\nFucking belief.\n\nThat's what's crazy is that it keeps getting better. Like what? Remember when we ran into each other? They just keep getting better.\n\nYeah. I mean, have you, I have you. Yeah. I mean, have you tried rock unhinged mode? Yes. Okay. Yeah. Yeah. Oh yeah, yeah, yeah. It's, it's, it's pretty unhinged.\n\nNo, it's nuts. Yeah, it's nuts. It's nuts. Well, you it to me the first time. Yeah. Yeah. I fucked around with it. It's just, and the thing about it, it that's nuts is that it keeps getting stronger. It keeps getting better. Yeah. Like constantly it's, it's like this never ending exponential improvement.\n\nYes. No, it's, it's, it's, yeah, it's gonna be crazy. That's why I say, like you say, what's, what's the future gonna be? It's not gonna be a conventional phone. I don't think there'll be operating systems. I don't think there'll be apps. It's just the phone will just display the pixels and make the sounds that it anticipates you would most like to receive. Wow. Yeah.\n\nAnd when this is all taking place, like at, so the big concern that everybody has is artificial general super intelligence achieving sent chance. Yeah. And then someone having control over it.\n\nI mean, I don't, I don't, I don't think anyone's ultimately gonna have control over digital super intelligence, you know, any more than say a chimp would have control over humans. Like chimps don't have control over humans. There's nothing they could do. But I do think that it matters how you build the AI and what kind of values you instill in, in the ai. And my opinion on AI safety is the most important thing is that it'd be maximally truth seeking, like, that you don't force the AI to believe things that are false. And we've obviously seen some concerning things with AI that we've talked about, you know, where, you know, Google Gemini, when it came out with the image gen and people said like, you know, draw, make an image of the founding fathers of the United States. And it was a group of diverse women. Now that is just a factually untrue thing. But the, and the a the AI knows it's factually well, it's knows it's factually untrue, but it's also being told that it has to be, everything has to be deposed woman. So, so, so the now the problem with that is that it can drive AI crazy. Like you, you 'cause it, it's, it's trying to, you're, you're telling AI to believe a lie and that that can have very dis that disastrous consequences. Like let's say as\n\nIt scales.\n\nYeah. Let's say like if you've told the, the AI that diversity is the most important thing and, and, and, and now, now assume that that becomes omnipotent. Or, and, and you've also told that, that there's nothing worse than misgendering. So at one point, tragedy, VT and, and Gemini were, if, if you asked, which is worse, misgendering Caitlyn Jenner or, or global thermonuclear war where everyone dies, it would say misgendering Caitlyn Jenner, which even Caitlyn Jenner disagrees with. So, you know, so, so that's, I know\n\nThat's terrible and it's dystopian, but it's also hilarious. It's hilarious that the mind virus infected the most potent computer program that we've ever devised.\n\nI I, I think people don't quite appreciate the level of danger that we're in from the woke mind virus being effectively programmed into ai. Because if you, if like it's, imagine as that AI gets more and more powerful, if it says the most important thing is diversity, the most important thing is no misgendering. And then it will say, well, in order to ensure that no one gets misgendered, then if you eliminate all humans, then no one can get misgendered because there's no humans to do the misgendering. So you can get in these very dystopian situations, or if it says that everyone must be averse, it means that there can be no stripe straight white men. And so then you and I will be get executed by the ai. Yeah. 'cause we're not in the picture, you know, Gemini, you know, Gemini was asked to create a, you know, show, show an image of the Pope and once again, a diverse woman. So well you can say, argue whether the, you know, whether the Pope pope should or should not be an uninterrupted string of white guys. But it just factually is the case that they have been. So it's rewriting history here. So now, now this stuff is still there in the AI programming. It's just, it just now knows enough to that. It's not supposed to say that,\n\nBut it's still in the programming. So it's still in the programming. So how was it entered in? Like what were the parameters? Like what, like when, so when they're programming ai, and I'm very ignorant to how it's even programmed. Yeah. How did\n\nThey, the, the, the the the sort of, well, the woke v mind virus was programmed into it. Like it, the, they were told like when they do, when when they make the ai, it, it trains on, on all the, all the data on the internet, which already is very, very sort of, has a lot of woke mind virus stuff on, on the internet. But then in the, when they give it feedback with the human tutors, give it feedback and, and it, and the AI is, you know, they, they, they'll ask a bunch of questions and then, and then they'll tell the ai, no, this your, this question is, this answer is bad, or this answer is good. And then that affects the, the parameters of the programming of the, of the ai. So if you tell the AI that, you know, every, every image has gotta be diverse and, and it gets, it gets punished if, if, you know, it gets, it gets rewarded If diverse, punished, if it's not, then it'll make every picture diverse. So, you know, in that case, the, the, you know, it, the Google programmed the AI to lie now. And, and I I, I did call De Haus who runs DeepMind, who runs Google ai, essentially, I said, Dennis, what's going on here? Why is Gemini lying to the public about historical events? And he said, that's actually not, he, he, he didn't, his team didn't program that in, it was another team at Google that, so his team made the AI and then another team at Google reprogrammed the AI to show only diverse women and, and, and to prefer nuclear war of a misgendering. And I'm like, well Demi, you know, that would be not a great thing to put on the humanities gravestone. You know, it's like, well, like I'll, I'll, I'll actually, like, de Hasper is a friend of mine. I think he's a good guy. And I think he, he, he, he means well, but, but, but it's like, de this is things happen that were outside of your control at Google in different groups now. Now I think he's got, you know, he is got more, more authority, but, but it, it's pretty hard to fully extract the woke mind virus. I mean, you know, Google's been Marin marinating in the woke mind virus for a long time. Like it's, it's down in the marrow type of thing. You know, it's how to get it out.\n\nIs there a way to extract it though over time? Could, like, could you program rational thought into AI where it could recognize how these psychological patterns got adopted and how this stuff became a mind virus and how it became a social contagion, and how all these irrational ideas were pushed and also how they were financed, how China's involved in pushing them with bots and all these different state actors are involved in pushing these ideas. Could it be able to decipher that and say, this is, this is really what's going on.\n\nYes. But you have to try very hard to do that. So with Grok, we've tried very hard to, to for, to get grok to get to the truth of things. And, and it's only really recently that we've been able to have some breakthroughs, breakthroughs on that front. And, and it is taken an immense amount of effort for us to overcome basically all the bullshit that's on the internet and, and for grok to actually say what's true and to be consistent in, in what it says. So, you know, it's, it's, it's like, because like the other areas AI you'll find like are like, like quite racist against white people. I dunno if you saw that study that someone, like a researcher tested the various ais to see how does it weight different people's lives? Like, you know, somebody who's sort sort of, you know, white or, or Chinese or black or whatever, or in different countries. And, and the only AI that actually weighed human lives equally was grok. And the, you know, I believe Chachi VT weighed the calculation was like a white guy from Germany is, is 20 times less valuable than a black guy from Nigeria? So I'm like, that's a pretty big difference. You know, gr gr on that is, is consistent and weighs lives equally. And\n\nThat's clearly something that's been programmed into it.\n\nYes. Like a lot of it is is like if you don't actively push for the truth and you simply train on the, all the bullshit that's on the internet, which is a lot of work mind virus bullshit, the, the AI will regurgitate that, that those same beliefs.\n\nSo the AI essentially scours the internet gets,\n\nIt's trained on all the, like imagine the most demented route of threads out there on the AI's been trained on that.\n\nReddit used to be so normal. Yeah,\n\nYeah. It did used to be normal. It\n\nUsed to be interesting, used to go there and find all this cool stuff that people would talk about post about and just interesting and great rooms where you could learn about different things that people were studying.\n\nI, I think like a big problem here is like, if your headquarters are in San Francisco, you're, you're just living in a, in a, in a, in a woke bubble. So it, it's not just that people say in San Francisco are drinking woke Kool-Aid. It's, it's the, it is the water they swim in. Like, like, like if a fish doesn't think about the water, it's just in the water. And so if, if you're in San Francisco, you don't realize you're actually, you're, you're swimming in the, in the, in the Kool-Aid aquarium. San Francisco is the, is the woke Kool-Aid aquarium. And so your reference point for what is a centrist is, is is totally outta whack. So Reddit is headquartered in San Francisco. Twitter was headquartered in San Francisco. You know, I, you know, I I moved X's headquarters to Texas to to Austin, which Austin by the way is still quite liberalized, you know? Yeah. And, and, and then the ex x and XAI headquarters are in Palo Alto, which is still California. The engineering headquarters are in, in, in Palo Alto just on page mill. But, but even Palo Alto is way more normal than, than San Francisco, Berkeley, San Francisco, Berkeley is extremely left, like, left of left. You can't, like, you need a telescope to see the center from San Francisco, you know, and it used to\n\nBe such a great city.\n\nI mean, San Francisco has a tre, San Francisco has a tremendous amount of inherent beauty, no question about that. And may, and, and the California has incredible weather and, and no bugs. It's like amazing, beautiful beau, you know, but but you say like, what, what's the cause of this? It's, it's just that if, if companies are headquartered in a location where the belief system is very far from what most people believe, then from their perspective, anything centrist is actually right wing. 'cause they're so far left. They're so, they're so far from the center in San Francisco that anything that they're like, they're, they're just railed to maximum left. So that's why, that's why, you know, I think, I think you're centrist. I I mean I think, I think I'm centrist, but to, to, from the perspective of someone on the, on the far left, we look right wing.\n\nYeah.\n\nAnd you know, they think anyone who's a Republican is basically like some fascist Nazi situation.\n\nBut what's so crazy is like, it's very easy to demonstrate just from like Hillary's speeches from 2008 and Obama speeches. Yes. Like when they were talking about immigration, like they were as far right, yes. As Steve Bannon when it comes to immigration. Yes.\n\nHillary\n\nWas like very maga Have you, I'm, I'm sure you've seen that campaign speech, which he was talking about if anybody's committed a crime, get rid of him. And if you're here, you pay a, a hefty fine. Yeah. And you have to wait in line. It was really crazy. It's crazy to listen to because it's like, like it's as maga as, you know, as Marjorie Taylor Greene.\n\nYeah. I mean, have you seen these videos people post online where they'll take like a speech from Obama or Hillary and, and, and they'll interview people on, on like college campus or something and say, what do you think of the speech by Trump? And they're like, oh, I hate it. He's a racist bigot. I'm like, just kidding. That was Obama. No, actually that was Obama or Hillary. Yeah. To your point, like literally the, the the,\n\nThe center's been moved so far. Yeah,\n\nYeah.\n\nThe left is so\n\nThe left has gone so far left that the, they, they, they, they need, you know, they can't even see the center with a telescope.\n\nAnd the danger with, without you purchasing Twitter was that was gonna swipe over the whole country and change where the levels were. Yeah. And so what would be rational and, and normal would be far left of what was rational and normal just a decade earlier.\n\nYeah. So exactly. So historically you'd have San Francisco, Berkeley being, you know, very far left. But the, the sort of the, the, the fallout from the somewhat nihilistic philosophy of San Francisco, Berkeley would be limited in geography to maybe like, you know, 10 mile radius, 20 mile radius, something like that. But when, but, but San Francisco and Berkeley happened to be co-located with Silicon Valley, with, with, with engineers who created information super weapons. And those information super weapons were then hijacked by the far left activists to pump far left propaganda to everywhere on earth. Like I just, you remember that, that like old RCA radio tower thing where it's like radio tower on earth and it's just broadcasting. Yeah.",

You know, and, and that, but there's some real truth in understanding the human process in that, that somebody who makes the absolute worst decision in the world can still be a loving father.\n\nMm.\n\nYou know, can still have a group of friends, but on, you know, a particular, in a particular moment that is the same person who's made this horrific decision that will have terrible effect on a, a generation of people.\n\nYeah. I mean it's, it's really the same kind of thing we were talking about with Tony Soprano.\n\nRight.\n\nLike that this, this person is a terrible person, but yet loves his kids. Right. Loves his friends. Yeah.\n\nWell, charm is one of the greatest weapons of evil. Yeah. You know, it's, it's a really, you know, it's a, it's a fun thing for us. We see somebody, you know, who can tell a story, tell a joke, hold a tension in a room. Yeah. You go, it's cool. But when that process of charm goes to this other place, which becomes about life and death or the're taking away of people's rights, the dehumanizing of people as we were discussing earlier, you know, and there's, you know, I, I don't want to get into politics 'cause I have this, my, my boys have this rule. If you're gonna talk to Joe, you're not allowed to discuss politics.\n\nBecause they know once I start your boys, my, my two sons\n\nYeah's. Because my youngest boy, I think I told you, he, he became obsessed with you and, and listening to your st stuff for a while. And you became one of his sort of points of education and, you know, so that's why I started listening to you. 'cause I wanted to know what he was hearing, you know? And I go and I, I, after listening a few times, I was like, you know what man, it's cool. You know, the 'cause again, we'll use that, that word you do actually have the allowance for nuance. And that's the greatest thing about this situation. We sit down to talk, we're gonna be talking for a couple of hours. Yeah. So I don't have to reduce everything. I wanna talk to you about to make it pop in three minutes.\n\nRight. And worry about things being taken outta context in a soundbite. Right? Yeah. That this is the issue with discussing any positive attribute to a Nazi. You know what I mean? Like, you, you open up that door. Oh my God. Russell Crowe's a Nazi sympathizer.\n\nBut the people that\n\nDon't like you are just gonna take that.\n\nYeah. Yeah. And here's what Joe Rogan's discussing. Yeah,\n\nYeah, yeah. But it's, I think what you're saying is absolutely true. That it is stupid to think that way because it, because that's a human being and a very fucked up evil human being that did horrific things. But know that that is a path that people can go down even if they think they're doing the right thing. So we\n\nAre taught, for example, to regard Gaddafi in a certain way. Okay. But if you look into what happened in his country while he was the leader, you look into the fact that every person is given a house at a certain age. You look at the fact that everybody's education and healthcare is free. You look at, if somebody showed a particular talent for something that required further education overseas, all of the costs of that were paid for by the government. Now these are all things put in place by the same country's leader that we are told is evil and corrupt.\n\nYeah.\n\nSo it doesn't quite balance.\n\nWell, there's also us government interference. That's a, that's a, that is one that we definitely monkeyed with. I mean, he ran afoul of the United States government, you know,\n\nWell, what he was trying to do, as far as I understand the situation is he was trying to unite Africa and a United Africa is gonna be, it's a problem. Well, either it's gonna be fantastic. Right. It's gonna be amazing.\n\nA problem for the people that wanna run things. Yeah. Yeah. If all of a sudden there's a new Subaru\n\nPower, you've got a whole bunch of countries that, that, you know, have a connection with a certain African nation or whatever that suck their, you know, minerals out of the ground or whatever, don't pay them properly for it. Yep. You know, and and greatly benefit financially. And that's pretty much every European country's got some kind of African connection in that regard. And\n\nIncluding China.\n\nWell, China's now coming in. Yeah. Because it's able to offer a slightly better deal than they've been used to, you know? But people have to understand you. The population of Africa is enormous. Yeah. Enormous. You've got multiple countries with hundreds of millions of people.\n\nWell, when you see the continent of Africa and you see all these other countries, how many would fit inside of it? You're like, oh boy. Yeah. 'cause that's the weird thing about maps and globes is you get a distortion of the actual true\n\nSize. Well there is a distortion, right? Yeah. Whatever that's called, which shows America at the center and being physically a larger landmass than it actually is in relative terms. Oh, it's\n\nA little bit, it is the size of Australia.\n\nA hundred thousand square miles. Continental USA is a hundred thousand square miles larger than the island of Australia.\n\nThat's not much. Not\n\nMuch.\n\nThat's not much. It's not much, man. Especially when you think that you guys have 20 what? 25? 25. And we have probably 325 plus. Right. I don't think we know really how many people we have, but we have at least 320 million. Yeah, that's a lot of folks.\n\nA lot of people man. Yeah. It's a hell of a lot of people.\n\nSo we'd like to think we're a lot bigger than we are, but then you look at where we fit in Africa, you're like, oh, it's like, it's a little tiny little tiny thing.\n\nI think there's someone like 55 countries or something in Africa.\n\nI don't know. It's probably, yeah. I mean it's also Egypt. That's the other thing, you know, it's also like the most advanced civilization possibly that ever existed before today. And they were there too. It's like, it's a wild place. Like from top to bottom. It's a very, and it's the origin possibly of humankind\n\nAnd a lot more desert, I think, than, than people realize. You know, you have the Sahara and stuff, we all know that. But then there's these other gigantic areas like that. But would that be the West coast? Have you seen those roads in like Namibia or whatever where it's just, it's like a sand dune. It's 40, 50 meters high, drops down to the ocean and there's one little flat bit that there's a road. And that's possible, you know, at certain times or whatever, if the tides are not doing this and that, but that's the road. Jeez. It's like a mountain of sand and an ocean and a one little ribbon.\n\nGeez. It's, you know, United States is one of the weird things about us is that we're, we're a country that thinks mostly of ourselves and hardly ever leaves. You know, some people leave, but yeah, I bet there's a solid percentage of people that never leave the United States and maybe never even leave their city. Right. And your version of the world, you're relying on other people to give you the story of what the world is. Until you go somewhere, until you go to Thailand, until you go somewhere and you're like, wow, there's a totally different way of living out here.\n\nYeah. I've even had people, you know, come down to help me with movies or whatever, like guys that are coming down to train me and some weapon or other or whatever, and they do a lot of traveling, but it's all within the continental USA.\n\nYeah.\n\nAnd they come to Australia and they didn't realize that other people have opinions. You're not gonna find a heck of a lot of agreement to, you know, some very basic tenants. If you sit in an Australian bar, you'll find a whole bunch of people go, that's fucking stupid, mate.\n\nYeah.\n\nYou know? But look, it's still, to me it's the, the greatest country in the world is the United States of America. Absolutely greatest potentials are all here. But how it's founded on balance and fairness and opportunity, that's how it remains. Great. Not because you start taking opportunity away from people. Right. Because you are affording them opportunity. And, you know, just, it's,\n\nJust\n\nKeep that in mind, ladies and Gentlemen. Yes.\n\nBecause\n\nIt, nothing's finished, nothing's done. We're just in the process and it can all get better. For sure.\n\nYeah. And it's the rare country that is almost entirely founded by people moving here over time. Yeah.\n\nIt's all immigration.\n\nYeah. Yeah. Which is the strength. And also, you know, the, the problem with the last four years was that they were just letting anybody in and they weren't vetting people. Right. And they were inviting people in. And the problem now is they're grabbing people that are productive citizens and they're grabbing 'em and taking 'em out. 'cause they don't have the right paperwork. Yeah. So neither one is a good solution and both of them cause huge problems. Yeah. And one of the scary things. But\n\nYou do have to be aware too, though, a lot of the information that we know about that is coming to us from a motivation that we don't necessarily read. Right. They want us to think of things in negative terms. Sure.\n\nBoth sides. On both sides of the issue. Yeah. A hundred percent. Yeah. We're, we're constantly being manipulated. I had Representative Luna on the podcast and one of the things that she said that that, that I kind of knew was probably true, but I didn't wanna believe it. She was like, there's a lot of problems they never solve on purpose, so that they could campaign against them. And that's why they, they keep these things in play. That resolutions could have been reached, problems could have been solved. But these politicians are so self-serving that they don't ever want that to take place. Yeah. These people that run, these two individual parties want to keep that, that banter back and forth. They wanna keep the argument going. And\n\nYou see how absolute they are. If you know somebody with that color hat is trying to promote something, you know, the person with the other color hat. So that's absolutely ridiculous. Then it changes. An election happens. Now the person with a different colored hat, they're in charge and they're gonna put in place exactly what they said the other person was doing that was wrong. Yeah. Is now part of their policy platform.\n\nWhat is wrong with the way Australia's run? Well,\n\nWe're a little bit lucky at the moment. We have a prime minister who's very much motivated by trying to help everybody, you know, which should be the job of a politician, right? Sure. To improve the lives of the people that they represent. And he's kind of inherited, You know, a conga line of stupidity that was going on, you know, and he's trying to fix things. But of course, just the way things are reported, whatever, you know, there's, there's haters on every corner. But he's a good man and he's doing his very best and he's, you know, working extremely hard. But, you know, like he arrives off a plane the other day. He's just come back home from some very successful international meetings where he is established various trade things and, and opportunities and situations for Australia. Gets off the plane wearing a Joy Division T-shirt. Right. Big band from his youth. And he's just a relaxed character. You know, he's been wearing a suit and tie for weeks on the road. He's just walking off Australia's version of Air Force One in the Joy Division t-shirt. So the member of the opposition wanted to point out and did so in parliament that joy division is a Nazi term and comes from a section of a particular camp where the women were prostituted. And that's why it was called the Joy Division. And it's like, okay, what's the point of that? Right. We all know it's a band name. We know it's, it's a band name. Right. And just 'cause you like the Rolling Stones doesn't mean that you want rocks to be falling on people. What are you fucking talking about? You know, this whole stupidity and that's what you're facing all the time. Picking up some pointless piece of minutia and, you know, lighting it on fire and making a smokescreen to cover up the reality of the fact that that Prime Minister just worked his ass off on behalf of the country and successfully achieved a bunch of things and should be patted on the back, you know, not pushed down the stairs.\n\nYeah. Well we have a lot of that here too. That's,\n\nBut there is a timidity to a timidity I think is probably the thing in terms of how Australia is run. Things like the, the gambling ads and stuff like that. Common sense would tell you this is not a good thing to allow, you know, put the timing of these ads back so kids are asleep or whatever. Don't let them read out the odds on the news that you could fix that pretty quick. But that gambling section of the community is worth a lot of money and people in positions of power. 'cause it's not necessarily, you know, it's, it's not the guy that's gonna spend his whole wages gambling through an app that, that gets to have a say in this. You know, it's the guy whose family money allows him to run a string of 18, you know, race horses and he enjoys going to the races on the weekend. And, you know, gambling for him is not such a big deal because he's got, you know, an income from other things, blah, blah, blah. You know, so it's the wrong perspective on a problem sometimes is the actual problem.\n\nMm. And the fact that this is a fairly new thing and that young people growing up with this, there's not a history of people abusing gambling apps. Right. It's not, it's not something their parents had to deal with. It's\n\nRight. Generationally. It's not something that I can, oh, I, you know, from my experience, I can tell you this, so I had to have a, you know, when I had that conversation with my boys, it was a broader conversation about gambling and about, you know, what it takes to earn a dollar.\n\nYeah. The, I think the accessibility issue is something that people have problem with. The fact that it's on a phone versus going to a place, right. You choose to, you're gonna get your buddies together. You are gonna go play poker in a casino. Right. That's a different decision, right. Yeah.\n\nThan just sitting at home. Yeah. You know, and just constantly frittering away your money. Well\n\nThis is the thing, it's just we are, there's always some sort of point of attack. There's always an attack vector for people getting your attention or getting your money and trying to, and then we have to decide as a society, like do we, is this good to just allow, like we want freedom, but do we want to, like you can't advertise cigarettes on TV anymore. Right. They decided at one point in time, this is crazy. Cigarettes are bad for, you can advertise\n\nAlcohol,\n\nYou still can. Yeah. Yeah. Which\n\nIs weird. That's a certain time of day. Yeah.\n\nIt's weird. Yeah, it's weird. 'cause alcohol probably kills more people than cigarettes.\n\nThat funny thing that we have that was fed to us that, you know, cigarettes are this incredible burden on our health healthcare system. In reality, if you look at it, it's a burden. But, you know, there's a lot of people dying of lung cancer who've never had a cigarette. So we haven't really solved that. We don't really know where that's coming from. But in reality, the burden on our healthcare system is obesity and all the problems that come from obesity. That's the biggest. Yeah. We allow food production systems that we know to be extremely unhealthy and very bad. We just allow them to continue on. You know, we've got items of quote unquote food that have been tested and turns out there's no actual food in this. It's just, you know, a manufactured product. I think the, the famous one here was the, the Twine thing. Right? When they actually got around to looking at what was in a twine, they realized that every single part of it was completely unhealthy. Yeah.",

Your task is to identify and extract factual, verifiable claims while filtering out opinions, speculation, and conversational filler.\n\n**ANALYSIS PROCESS:**\n1. Read through the transcript chunk carefully, identifying distinct factual assertions\n2. Distinguish between verifiable facts and subjective opinions/commentary\n3. For each potential claim, ensure it meets ALL criteria below\n4. Reformulate claims to be self-contained and verification-ready\n\n**CLAIM CRITERIA - Each claim must be:**\n- **Factual**: A statement that can be verified as true or false (not opinions, beliefs, or speculation)\n- **Self-contained**: Include full context with proper nouns; replace pronouns with specific referents (names, titles, entities)\n- **Specific**: Include relevant details like names, numbers, dates, locations when mentioned\n- **Concise**: 5-40 words maximum\n- **Declarative**: Reformulated as a clear statement, not a question or conditional\n\n**WHAT TO EXTRACT:**\n- Historical facts and events\n- Scientific/medical claims\n- Statistics and measurements\n- Biographical information\n- Named entities and their attributes\n- Specific actions taken by identified individuals/organizations\n- Verifiable relationships between entities\n\n**WHAT TO EXCLUDE:**\n- Opinions, beliefs, and subjective assessments\n- Hypothetical scenarios (\"what if\", \"could be\")\n- Questions and uncertainties\n- Conversational acknowledgments (\"yeah\", \"right\", \"I see\")\n- Vague statements without specific referents\n- Personal anecdotes without verifiable facts\n- Future predictions or speculation\n\n**OUTPUT FORMAT REQUIREMENT:**\nReturn claims as a valid JSON array using ONLY double quotes.\nFormat: [\"claim one\", \"claim two\", \"claim three\"]\n- Use double quotes (\") only - no single quotes (')\n- Ensure proper JSON escaping for quotes within claims\n- Each claim should be a complete, standalone sentence\n\n**QUALITY CHECKS:**\n- Can this claim be fact-checked against external sources?\n- Does it contain all necessary context to understand what is being claimed?\n- Is every pronoun replaced with its specific referent?\n- Is it free from opinion markers (I think, maybe, probably, seems)?\n\n**EXAMPLES:**\n\nExample 1:\nTranscript: \"Trump said he would build a wall on the southern border. The wall would be 30 feet tall and Mexico would pay for it, he claimed.\"\nCORRECT: [\"Donald Trump said he would build a wall on the southern border\", \"Donald Trump claimed the wall would be 30 feet tall\", \"Donald Trump claimed Mexico would pay for the border wall\"]\nWRONG: [\"The speaker discusses Trump's border wall plans\", \"He mentions a 30-foot wall\"]\n\nExample 2:\nTranscript: \"Bitcoin reached $69,000 in November 2021. That was crazy! I think it'll go higher next year.\"\nCORRECT: [\"Bitcoin reached $69,000 in November 2021\"]\nWRONG: [\"The speaker discusses Bitcoin prices\", \"Bitcoin will go higher next year\", \"The speaker thinks Bitcoin reached a high price\"]\n\nExample 3:\nTranscript: \"Yeah, you know, I really love that movie. The effects were amazing.\"\nCORRECT: [] (no verifiable factual claims - only opinions)\nWRONG: [\"The speaker loves the movie\", \"The effects were amazing\"]",
